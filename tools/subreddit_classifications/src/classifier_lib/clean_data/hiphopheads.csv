hiphopheads,removed,cuck
hiphopheads,removed,oh shit racism in america doesnt involve white people hes tackling the same issue as martin luther king jr did in his httpswwwafricaupenneduarticlesgenletterbirminghamhtml i have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the negros great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the white citizens counciler or the ku klux klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice who constantly says i agree with you in the goal you seek but i cannot agree with your methods of direct action who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another mans freedom who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the negro to wait for a more convenient season shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection yeah i wish everyone would read the letter and heed the words from years ago but im fine with people getting the message now and maybe some people will listen to a white dude that seems like them rather than black folks speaking about their experience hint this happens a lot in hiphop but ewww its macklemore is just another way to deflect from the issue by criticizing the delivery of the message rather than the substance of the message
hiphopheads,removed,with an ass like that i dont care if it was sloppy thirds for real the cream pie from the last guy could still be present and id eat that shit like a pitbull eating a bowl of oatmeal edit forgot to say no homo that means im definitely not gay rightright

hiphopheads,removed,wo the training wheels
hiphopheads,removed,we started in the midwest now we bout to take it all over the world baby
hiphopheads,removed,follow me all around the planet i run the gamut on sickology
hiphopheads,removed,hey i made this mix lol
hiphopheads,removed,it would stop being that way if they stopped being little shits all the time they dont work and refuse to send their kids to school even romania sees them as immigrants from india you cant comment on this if you havent lived in europe or encountered gypsies
hiphopheads,removed,well except i never commented on black people lmao let me tell you something so you leave me the fuck alone they refuse to speak the language of the country theyre in why they dont need to they never go to school and even less go to work theyre employess of a bigger mafia that takes their money but leaves them just enough to live their culture of stealing is shit the young are forced to take care of the elder so theyre pretty much forced to stealplay shitty music in public areasbeg they have no legal documents arresting them is pointless you expel them and they come back because theyre nomadic they trash entire neighborhoods because theyre just dirty as fuck i know what the fuck im talking about
hiphopheads,removed,what are your thoughts on a lot of muslims being racist sexist and homophobic as a result of their religion
hiphopheads,removed,of rappers up until probably the mid to late were homophobic as fuck the same way our parents generation and before are full of people with homophobic beliefs i do not think their mind set is acceptable but thats what happens when youre told one thing your whole life and everyone around you follows it as well i imagine this was also years ago id be interested to know if x still holds these beliefs
hiphopheads,removed,you have no clue romas are honestly terrible people they steal everything they get trained from a young age to steal pickpocket etc they live as if theres no tomorrow they dont care about anyone the girls get pregnant from the moment they get their first period sometimes to wayy older guys but mostly with their first cousin or maybe even their brother they are not allowed to go to school i have hundreds of stories since a few of my friends are into the deep end with a roma gang its not even racism to say any of this its just the blatant truth no roma will tell you different or be embarrased about it so not remotely comparable to white on black racism
hiphopheads,removed,fuck that the man is entitled to his opinion fact is he comes from a place where this is not accepted you cant judge someone for their perception even if you think its wrong there are reasons people feel the way they do and until you can walk in their shoes you cant judge we going to stop listening to eazy snoop em dre they have all had homophobic lyrics and opinions yet we never judged them do you have to have a certain degree of popularity to be able to say these things
hiphopheads,removed,why if i may ask
hiphopheads,removed,what if i said that all nuggets deserve death is that just a word or will i get banned from the sub i could be dmx who knows
hiphopheads,removed,they forgave each other for that but you still cant get over it
hiphopheads,removed,hey now the man asked a reasonable question no need to get sensitive

hiphopheads,removed,here is a picture of the author of the article
hiphopheads,removed,has anyone heard about icp dissing tech nine
hiphopheads,removed,so that the best verse of is yeah yeah fuck is you talking bout bitch you offended me i just might go head and let this lil bitch suck my dick till it tickle me i just might go head and mix me a sprite with some lean like its chemistry goddamn i had four hoes at one time they was drilling me i heard the lil boy was plotting on killing me fuck round and lift up they soul like lil chino be wheelin i usually dont beg but i dont want the ceiling please oxycontin fucking kidneys up you say you cant take seriously the argument in the article for the existence of in hiphop yet there you are glorifying it
hiphopheads,removed,dmx is a closeted homosexual and is very ashamed
hiphopheads,removed,so about the fact that misogyny exists in hiphop another commenter here says rap is not the odd one out and you say singling out rap is racist instead of pointing fingers everywhere else to try to deflect its a bit curious there are no statements of misogyny is wrong and i dont like it in hiphop or anywhere else leads to the impression that you actually like and enjoy misogyny in your hiphop what else could it be wouldnt the best thing be to condemn the misogyny that does manifest in hiphop to make efforts to change that aspect of hiphop culture whether it is shaming the artists who promote it or speaking with your dollar and support on social media it would seem selfevident that if misogyny was cut out of hiphop as the cancer that it is that would be benificial to not only hiphop itself but the cultural shift that would manifest in those that listen to hiphop would have benefits like more respect for women not treating them as sexobjects greater respect for the familyunit marriage these are all things that actually would help the black community and society as a whole wouldnt you agree or is it just that misogyny is so engrained into hiphop culture that deepdown you really dont want to remove misogyny from hiphop culture because it feels edgy or rebellious you think its funny or will help train women and men to act loosely with their sexual virtue increasing your chances to have hookups you should really think about your motivations in serious selfreflection about why you strong feelings of opposition to removing misogyny from hiphop manifest in your heart whom or what are you serving
hiphopheads,removed,your argment is that as time goes on culture becomes increasingly degenerate and along with that increase there is also established a new cultural baseline normalcy and acceptance of it while that may be true it is also worth considering the pendulum effect that it cannot swing infinitely and forever in one direction to everincreasing levels of degeneracy eventually society will become sickened with the direction of it and revolt which is now currently happening the paradigm culture shift is happening and not a moment too soon
hiphopheads,removed,ergo decedo colloquially referred to as the traitorous critic fallacy well played i never thought to see you rear your ugly head in rhiphopheads unicefroyo you clever bastard youve done it

hiphopheads,removed,when i was in grade my parents bought me a tv with a built in dvd player i soon found out that this particular dvd player would play data discs this meant instead of a cd only being able to hold certain amount of time minutes back then it could hold a certain amount of data mbs i believe and i could still listen to the songs so instead of getting songs on a cd i could get i then figured out that you could do the same process with a blank dvd only those hold gb i could essentially get my entire song library at the time in one place if i went to a friends we could pop it in his computer and all the song would be available then i figured out it worked with video movies were fairly easy to get off limewire so i started with that but then i realized i could also do this with porno i download them burn them delete them and my parents would be none the wiser anyway one of the first pornos ive ever downloaded had tory lane in it and now every time i see tory lanez name i think of it if anyone wants to know the type of collection year old me was dealing with nsfw obviously

hiphopheads,removed,can you send it my way 🙏🏾
hiphopheads,removed,thats bullshit for one this is the internet dont want to read the comment thread about politics fold the thread simple solution if you cant handle the existence of discourse you should get off the internet and go play with some dolls or something as a mod your job is to prevent rule violations like piracy personal info disclosure etc not to frame conversation especially on a subreddit like hhh where half the comments are memes secondly politics are engrained within hip hop and if you dont know that youre not a fan of hip hop look at the front page right now youve got vic mensa releasing songs about the mcdonald shooting for gods sake are we supposed to listen to that song and come into the comments and presumably not talk about the song fuck you uchrussell
hiphopheads,removed,meh
hiphopheads,removed,what kind of logic is that yes its primarily a board for rap not a forum for politics but this post is an article that is decidedly at the intersection of politics and hiphop hence why people came into the comments and started talking about politics people wouldnt discuss politics in the comments if it was unrelated to the content but if people start to talk politics in the comments of a hiphopheads post its probably because the content was related to politics they shouldnt stifle that discussion
hiphopheads,removed,yeezus christ its fucking lit fam 🔥🔥🔥

hiphopheads,removed,eh to each their own some people really like my style of rappingmusiclyricism doesnt really matter that you dont and i never try to sound like kendrick or anyone else i used to bite other rappers when i started out because i didnt have an identity but now i do i know who im completely myself when i rap i disagree that my lyrics arent dense or thoughtprovoking my lyricism has stepped up massively fuck that faux critique i would agree that i used to have a bunch of these cringey fauxdeep lyrics but thats changed since although i might drop the corny line here and there who doesnt it happens im working hard every day to create ive been good at writing ever since i can remember and i know i have some incredible poetry to share with the world its funny that you also commented only on this song which i would admit isnt one of the best on mbf its not my best singing or sung hook its a bit off just didnt quite hit the mark and wasnt executed how i intended it to be still its dope the verse is one im proud of too its told backwards so if you were to read it from the last bar to the first it would make most sense in that order yet its cool because it makes sense backwards also i have no problem with criticism i even criticized myself multiple times in my comment right here and i can guarantee you im my own harshest critic but i just find your critique to be simply wrong like with the kendrick stuff for example that being said im still working and improving literally every single day im getting better its a work in progress mixingwise i have someone else do the mixing for my music and he does it better than i could sure sometimes the vocals come out somewhat overpowering and there could be other issues here and there but overall i think it sounds quite dope damn near professional in an independent hip hop type of way especially considering i still use a fairly shitty budget microphone and record in a bedroom i know i have places to go and ill get their eventually i wrote and recorded mbf in one week mostly and my first mixtape in a bit over one week for my next project im really going to take my time more so im gonna come up with more interesting concrete concepts flows rhyme patterns and lyrics i disagree that im lacking in these departments youve mentioned as if im some kind of sucka mc when there are horrible rappers dropping horrible lyrics and horrible music that sounds the same as everyone else churned out by one big machine every single damn day and yet they seem to get more love and attention than any real artists out there joey badass recently called them all out on twitter and it was a beautiful thing to be finally see said from a known hip hop artist i can list you a seriiously solid number of examples of really dope lyrics that im proud of from mbf alone my favorite song has gotta be rogue rats one of the coldest songs i ever pieced together anyway the next full project you see posted by me on this subreddit will be truly special itll be unique itll sound incredible productionwise mixingwise lyrically vocally deliverywise in so many ways i know itll be the project that brings me a lot of attention rather than just some or like a decent amount ive gotten a solid amount of support since i started as tom solar in under months since i posted my first song if youre interested this right here is an example of how shitty i used to be and it shows just how much ive already improved even though this shit is pretty embarassing im not embarassed to share it because im proud of the results of my hard work and dedication to the thing i love most and im not ever stopping

hiphopheads,removed,ok
hiphopheads,removed,you know that girl you always look at and think damn i think i really like that chick but shes like and way out of my league cause ill be honest im not the best lookin dude anyways so this past saturday i was at party with all my friends and ive been talking to this chick more often whenever i see her but nothing more than casual conversation so i see her and shes kinda stickin with me and talkin and stuff but im still not convinced it means anything since shes just a nice girl in general and will strike up conversations with anyone so i dont really think much of it but she gets kinda touchy and not gonna lie my hopes are pretty high at this point thatll this means something eventually we part to different parts of the party since i dont want to creepy and follower her around after getting pretty drunk by a fire in the backyard i go back to see what everyone else doing i walk over to the beer pong table and i see the girl playin with this guy and shes got her around around him and being touchy just like she was with me now i didnt mean to get my hopes as high as i did but seeing that kinda made me think that she just does that to everyone and it didnt mean anything it didnt make me sad tho cause im still having a great time and pretty damn drunk also not gonna lie im pretty used to thinking i could get with a girl just for nothing to happen between us at a party so its not the first time so the partys drawing to a end and im starting to say goodbye to everyone at the party including her and she hugs me says goodbye yknow the usual as im leaving the backyard i realize i forgot my bag and have to go back in and grab it not trying to talk to anyone just grab my bag cause my buddies are waiting in the car to skrt out of there i leave the backyard again after i get my bag but this time as i walk out the gate i hear this the girl say oh wait i gotta go say goodbye to threekidsathome when i heard this im out of the backyard where everyone was partying and in the front yard where nobody can see us she comes and hugs me again and as in pulling out the hug we kinda just look at each other for like maybe a half second it felt like and bam we just start making out now im not sure exactly how that happened cause remember im pretty wasted and she might have been more drunk then me we stop and she just ran back in im pretty sure and im like holy fuck did that just happen so im back in the car with my buddies now and i dont tell anyone what happened i just felt like she wouldnt want me going and telling every about it so the whole ride home in in this great mood and really thinking if it meant anything or it was just a spur of the moment thing ill be honest ive typed a lot and dont how to end this story off well but i text her in the morning and we dont mention anything about making out just a nice talk about random shit so now its days later and im still thinking about it from time to time cause you gotta understand ive known her for like years and not once did i think i would have any chance with this girl in my life so my group of friends has a party usually like everyone other weekend and shes almost there and im excited for the next one the next party will tell me if she actually wants more of what happened or it was a just drunk thing im pretty bad at story telling and never post in these threads so i hope this was easy to understand but im just looking forward to what will happen next with this chick the end

hiphopheads,removed,i once met frank ocean at a bar down in chicago frank was sipping on some beer alone when i walked over to him and asked for a picture and autograph to which he said no in a very angry way i knew something had to be up with him so i asked the guy who was my favorite artist of all time what was wrong the label is giving me some trouble being a nag tonight and is always on my nerves i just need to release boys dont cry was around july last year im sorry man he apologized and we shot the shit for several hours took the picture and straight up just talked about his life after the hip hop world his new album and the music business as a whole we talked until closing and we were paying and thats when i thought what better way to repay my favorite artist of all time than to pay for his entire tab i politely suggested that i pay for him to which he was hesitant but eventually let me frank then shook my hand and gave me his email and told me to email him sometime if i ever wanted to come to the studio and chill or if i wanted to just talk so later that night i mustered up enough courage and decided to email frank and for months upon months we talked one day he invited me out to lunch in new york and told me the ways of the business and then invited me to his house and of course i said yes so frank and i took a road trip and after countless hours of frank and i switching between driving we decided to not go to concert and to travel the united states and to make a long story short for months frank and i had a breathtaking man on man affair across the states from seeing the elegance of niagara falls to the astonishing sight of the grand canyon all the way to traveling across the golden gate bridge frank ocean and i made marvelous gay love across the united states of america

hiphopheads,removed,everybody thirsty of teyana and i just a piece of ivans dick no homo
hiphopheads,removed,from rkanye at the end tenaya becomes a cat she literally becomes pussy this stands out a lot to me especially after such a sexualized video note that kanye goes for the hyper exaggerated deliberately kitschy imagery when making a point that was the intent that inexplicably went over so many heads for bound that was working on americana hero imagery and trashy redneck values confederate patches on merch etc and he was trying to appropriate it hes doing the same for sexuality tackling kitschy imagery this is a homage to sexualised workout videos sample is an house track but this time with high production values so people cant miss the point by accusing him of shoddy technical ability the impact of turning the weirdly hyper sexualised woman into literally a pussy is jarring it breaks you from the spell of being a slobbering horny animal real quick its like the self introspection the moment after an orgasm watching nasty porn you really think about what the fuck you were doing in that sexualised trance state

hiphopheads,removed,ok dis hard
hiphopheads,removed,😂😂
hiphopheads,removed,how is this considered good here and lil dicky isnt lol
hiphopheads,removed,mixing is bad but atleast he is rapping again
hiphopheads,removed,too much sauce ft lil uzi is 🔥🔥🍝
hiphopheads,removed,before i start this is the day i bless you but also this is your worst mistake in a few you asked the wrong person and now im bout to drop a big ass wall of text but trust me will be worth your time everything started out with ti what you know song from the king album that is what hooked me up to become a fan of tip ever since i first heard it back in i mean tips discography is something to really discover and this doesnt come from me being a true crazy tip fan tip is just an extrodinary rapper with excellent lyricisma bit complex at times not as easy to comprehend unless explained carefully his flow is legendary no matter what beat he hops on he always managed to flow so great with it and kill it and the best of it all for me atleast is that hes the best at this trap shit we all know about sorry to gucci fans but the facts always remain that quality quantity but people take it the wrong way anyway you should start with telling yourself to give tip a good chance tip isnt just any artist when you sit down and listen to him you know he differs from everyone just like any other rapper like nas rakim krsone pac biggie jayz and many many other rappers im not comparing mind you just trying to prove a point here start off with his first album its kinda important to understand where he first came from the expectations from his first album was high because the hype excitement built around tip after people talking about him being dope as fuck and all that but in the real it flopped in terms of sales its not his best album but he has some important songs songs like still aint forgave myself probably still his best song hes ever made to this date dope boyz what happened you aint hard im serous iirc the first song he made public to people he had some crazy claims here lmao to play me baby hey he gone need a track from god featuring jesus or jayz whats yo name one of my favorites heavy cheavys grand royale whew arista wasnt really happy with the sales and all and at the end they had to release him later on he chose to make grand hustle records his own label and start his own shit later on he also signed to atlantic records and that is where he dropped his second album trap muzik arguably his best album but also a classic album an album that sparked the genre trap which is now feeding almost every trap rapper out there that does this what i call whack trap shit compared to what it used to be also this is the time he started claiming to be the king of the south which he also later proved that he is the king of the south songs to lookout on trap muzik trap muzik i cant quit be easy that trap shit with piano gotdamn no more talk doin my job one of the best songs ever to be heard rubberband man classic just straight up classic look what i got i still love you ti vs tip love this talking between ti tip he does bezzle kingofdasouth be better than me a year later he comes back with the album named urban legend one of my favorite albums arguably his best album to date because at this point of time he truly reached a crazy peak in my opinion he dropped another classic album here following trap muzik songs to lookout for tha king whew motivation u dont know me asap prayin for help get loose the greatest get ya shit together countdown bring em out limelight whew one of my favorites right here dope ass shit chillin with my bitch my life years later he released what people like to refer to it being his best album ever this is where tip was the biggest with his music and made another classic album it sold hellah well too the first week but mind you this is like my least liked album i dont know why but i could never just connect with it too many songs i really dont favor myself but it still is an amazing album for people to discover that hasnt already songs to lookout on the album king back front back what you know live in the sky ride wit me why you wanna get it stand up guy bankhead whew im talkin to you i told you so hello goodlife top back after the success of king right after it was released his best friend philant died which wasnt easy for tip to take but he managed to get back up strong and continue with his career a year later tip releases the album called ti vs tip this wasnt as good as the other king trap muzik and urban legend and not really that much of a classic album but still a great album overall songs to lookout for act i tip act ii ti act iii the confrontation big shit poppin raw you know what it is da dopeman hurt help is comming my swag we do this touchdown tell em i said that respect this hustle one of my favorites my type a year later he released tip released another classic album called paper trail one of his best album to date songs to lookout for barsintro im illy ready for whatever on top of the world live your life whatever you like no matter what my tip song right here my life your entertainment pornstar swing ya rag what up whats happenin swagga like us you aint missing nothing dead and gone after comming out of prison and going back instead of the long awaited king uncaged which was probably going to be his most hungry crazy album to date instead he faces all this bullshit and turns around and says hes gonna do an apologetic album called no mercy this is where people consider this album to be the worst album hes ever done but for me its my favorite tip album its my favorite because it speaks to me more than any album does except for a few songs songs to lookout for welcome to the world how life changed get back up i cant help it thats all she wrote no mercy big picture salute everything on me poppin bottles castle walls yeah you know whew ya hear me whew im back whew in he dropped his album called trouble man heavy is the head one of my top favorite tip albums after being the jail and all and the release of his weak album no mercy nobody really didnt expect shit from him at this time around i feel like the hype died out for tip because it really took years for him to release some greatness and at this time around everyone hoped on the drake kendrick lamar train a sidenote here there are videos for trouble man that is rather small film together to look at it search for who want some then trap back jumpin and to finish it search for addresses songs to lookout for the introduction classic song reminds you of rubberband man whew g season trap back jumpin one of the best trap songs ever fucking made wildside ball sorry with andre whew this song is one of his best imo go get it guns and roses the way we ride whew addresses who want some wonderfull life hallelujah years later tip releases his latest album to date paperwork it did not help that tip didnt have as much hype as before it certainly didnt help the fact that he released the album the same day as logic did because all these white fagget ass people started jumpin on tip calling his album trash for no reason probably not even listening to it the album is such a missunderstood one this album is fucking goat i say goat because that is how i feel but most importantly this is where tip was finally trying to evolve in a much bigger way there are alot of great songs here but also some that really dont fit the album watering it down songs to lookout for king whew goat king shit g shit whew about the money new national anthem oh yeah private show jet fuel turnt shit paperwork stay about my issue on doe on phil let your heart go sugar cane one of my favorites you can tell how i walk and that is all again i know its a wall of fucking text but it aint much to read anyway go through it will be worth it i feel like his albums speak the most mean the most every album is a timeline for him showcasing you what hes going through what hes thinking etc these are all powerfull and have a good message behind them worthy of lsitenng mixtapes eps albums ti n pc in da streets pt pc to life album the leak fuck a mixtape fuck da city up hustle gang gdod hustle gang gdod

hiphopheads,removed,as a busy operator in the business of music i first want to thank you for taking a minute out of your day to read this i appreciate it kt burke began his relationship with music almost by accident with an impromptu freestyle challenge among friends but the breif rendezvous has since evolved into a torrid love affair with the art passion is not a strong enough word to describe his attraction to music because it leads one to rely only on emotions of the heart where as kts interest in music includes both the body and the brains his longing to learn more and improve his own skills has translated into an infatuated study of other rap and hip hop artists as well as artists of varying genres no longer does kt simply attend a concert for mere entertainment instead he stands among the crowds with his mind going faster than the rhymes busting through the speakers critically analyzing the artists performances kt also since has stop all swear words in his music and will continue throughout the rest of his career no feelings is radio ready no cussing in my music at all prodjrbeatz many styles wrapped in one lots of energy song link httpinyaearhiphopcomktkristianonofeelingsinyaearhiphopexclusiveprodbyjrbeatzktkillthem

hiphopheads,removed,im no drinker but i been drinking a lot more lately like now the fuck is going on
hiphopheads,removed,fucking pathetic lol
hiphopheads,removed,is in strong contention for most innovative flows of all time the dude transcended flowing in a normal way and finds pockets in beats where nobody else could
hiphopheads,removed,big boi andre at least by a little bit its not a huge gap and big boi can rap but idk if hes at level im biased tho love the guy
hiphopheads,removed,you are an assassin and are told to kill either james blake or sampha who do you choose and what is your method of assassination
hiphopheads,removed,those songs were never
hiphopheads,removed,neither of those songs hit number one
hiphopheads,removed,agreed on big boi im not comparing rapping ability but hes like what jay rock is to black hippy an underrated artist who no one bothers to acknowledge even though he has bars on bars and holds his own against who uses lots of internal rhymes and flows the average nonhiphophead probably wouldnt even know who he is
hiphopheads,removed,back when i was or i had my friend david over for a sleepover around midnight we were watching music videos on mtv when big pimpin came on being young little perverts we got hype because of the eye candy and started pointing out which girls we liked during jayzs first verse david asked me if i cared if he jacked off to the girls in the video i didnt think he was serious so i said sure and within a minute he whipped it out and finished i kept my eyes glued to the tv but in my peripherals i could see his hand moving faster than a hummingbirds wings after he finished i just went upstairs locked the door and promised myself to never invite him back over
hiphopheads,removed,waynes verse on sucker for pain tho

hiphopheads,removed,upon recently rewatching the wire it still blows my mind just how relevant it to this day police versus drug dealers isnt such a good and evil battlecorrupt unionswell intentioned newly elected mayors that get in tune with what the system dictates once when they get into officeinefficient school system that just cant help young people get taken in by the streetssensationalism in media that just make up facts and stories for ratingsyellow journalismhow no matter how much they are investigated some monstrous criminals only get locked for whatever petty case the police can actually prove or have a friend take the life sentence instead of them the writing and characters is just on another level than pretty much everything elseyou could make entire essays about all the nuances and issues the wire touched upon highly recommend everyone watch it

hiphopheads,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

hiphopheads,removed,what do you guys like to do in your free time that doesnt include music hobbies
hiphopheads,removed,just got in college recently and i think ive hit a rough patch i havent really met enough new people and the work load is a bit overwhelming i really dont have the work method down am seeing schoolboy q in november though so i guess i have that going for me
hiphopheads,removed,incoming rant i really hate how anyone that is an introvert is seen as antisocial nowadays just because id rather spend my spare time in between class at college listening to new music and doing my own thing instead of sitting with a group of people who go to the pub everyday to have a couple casuals in between class or talk about their trucks or how smashed they got last night doesnt make me weird yeah i have friends and go out and shit but while at school i just like to get my shit done and listen to some tunes between class and enjoy my coffee and for some reason im seen as different because of that maybe its because im from a small town and non of my friends from high school came to college with me and i am a bit quite but i hate that if you dont follow the social norm of hanging out and chatting with people all the time your that shy and quiet guy its like no i just dont want to talk to you anyway how is everyone enjoying the new mac only listened to it once through so dont have a full review on it but i did enjoy it quite a bit on first listen also what is everyones favourite nonhiphop albums im trying to expand my music repertoire
hiphopheads,removed,i just lost my longest snapchat streak and im very upset about it anybody have any music recommendations to get me through the night

hiphopheads,removed,how is this classic lil b i cant think of any other song by him which is five minutes long downtempo and consists mostly him crooming of the same hook over and over i mean there might be a few but i think of classic lil b more as goofy high energy bangers like like a martian fuck kd i own swag i got mo rent due bgycfmb bitch mob gangsta im fabio or at least thats the type of song he usually releases to promote an upcoming mixtape

hiphopheads,removed,he probably never thought twice about it well he should have i dunno pick up a book and read about slavery or something id suggest the souls of black folks by i grew up around hispanics in a poor ghetto neighborhood in los angeles lots of mexicans would say nigga around me sometimes one of us blacks would speak up about it like yo dont say that and sometimes itd slide by whats funny though is any time a black would say like wetback or paisa or any of the other similar hispanic terms they would lose their shit shrug

hiphopheads,removed,i believe that shooting happened some time ago and the video was only just released i saw his hashtag trending too when the video came out i think overall message thats being pushed is that there is a police brutality problem in this country and that it disproportionately affects black people
hiphopheads,removed,yo 😂
hiphopheads,removed,ultra light beams ive listened to coloring book already that song is seriously in debate to me for my favorite song of all time i need shit like thatalso listened to all of kanyes discography i love the gospel the hooks and just that song in general i need shit like that good stuff preferably rap songs but damn if its other genres like gospel give me the best stuff like that song much love❤️

hiphopheads,removed,sirens
hiphopheads,removed,she callin me jeffereyyyyy
hiphopheads,removed,i already posted on this discussion thread so i dont know if im breaking etiquette but why do you guys think of lil dicks ban im not trying to start a debate on peoples personal opinion on his music here because thats irrelevant to why he is banned and shouldnt play a part and if people still think their taste in his music should play a part in his ban i think being an xxl freshmen proves that he is a hip hop artist and this is a hip hop forum i understand why he was banned but that was about years ago and it shouldnt mean hip hop fans shouldnt be able to discuss him i understand what he did was a huge breach of conduct but then he should be banned not his music i know people defend his ban because hes popular in other subs but every comment in favor of him there starts by saying i dont like hip hop but i think hip hop fans have the right to discuss a hip hop artist with other hip hop fans on a sun dedicated to hip hop if discussion of his work was allowed again i think it would only be fair to put him on a very short leash carefully monitor those posting his stuff and any evidence of vote manipulation then i think it would only reasonable to lock him out for good and throw away the key
hiphopheads,removed,answer is really good too
hiphopheads,removed,kaytranada must never leave this sub
hiphopheads,removed,not to compare directly but i always questioned why ovo did this too tde and ovo are good brands with solid followings yet neither really capture fans too hard or have cleverprominent marketing campaigns or consumer engagement theyre both already established brands and rosters but could have so much more success with a more strategic marketingbranding campaign but maybe thats part of it and maybe us desiring more is part of their plan or they just dont have one and im reading too hard
hiphopheads,removed,still dont understand why nobody liked his last album shit was 🔥🔥🔥🔥

hiphopheads,removed,just talk to or listen to some women about what they think about it and you can learn more but honestly since you unironically said sjw you might not be willing to listen sjws are ironic folks in themselves i dont need to express irony when talking about them they are expression of irony by themselves just talk to or listen to some women about what they think about it and you can learn more lets just say misandry is a thing as well thats the point if his ex and jill harth couldnt get him in trouble why should i speak up precisely if rape allegations did not get him in trouble in his fucking primary campaign its more than likely they are faulty or americans are every woman has at one point in their life had a body part grabbed against their will i am willing to bet every man has at one point in their life had a body part grabbed against their will as well that doesnt mean they all dont have self respect having self respect in this case refers to the part where he gets away with it if he does not get slapped or refuted in any other physically manifested form thats consent in my book of course he will lie about actually receiving resistance though yes that sometimes happens but you know what else can instantly destroy someones liferape we shouldnt be so quick to dismiss women who claim to have been victims you are correct thats why i referred to rape allegations as too many dirt and too many ruined lifes because if they are true that destroys victims life if they are not it easily destroys life of accused thanks for having a cordial level headed conversation on the subject tho even tho we dont agree thanks to you too also notice that when talking about rape allegations i always keep a second possibility of voters being dumbasses in play why because we russians have just landed an actual convicted rapist into parliament

hiphopheads,removed,sad af that ignorant teenagers eat up this shit just like it was intended yeah man obama is soooo hip haha lit af that he got kendrick to perform at the white house what a hip president ha ha so you guys are voting dem next election right
hiphopheads,removed,whats there to enjoy i dont have tickets for the performance
hiphopheads,removed,no one knows what it means but its provocative
hiphopheads,removed,really enjoyed the production throughout this project my favourite song is probably bars or slave
hiphopheads,removed,as the leader of the democrat party as someone who wants to retain his legacy and doesnt want his progress overturned next year yes he does need votes
hiphopheads,removed,i love how fun the super mario bros track is and the intro transition into flexicution was so so good
hiphopheads,removed,really enjoyed it despite the initial reaction i had this was a solid album of hype songs that sounded like mixtape logic
hiphopheads,removed,i had a lot of fun listening to it and itll definitely stay in my rotation ill say its a solid or
hiphopheads,removed,that one corny skit where it says that logic is the only rapper where you wont get shot at a concert makes this album
hiphopheads,removed,great album felt like iyrtitl in making sure its got jams before cohesiveness
hiphopheads,removed,just shut the fuck up and enjoy it logic
hiphopheads,removed,flexicution is my favorite but bars is close
hiphopheads,removed,production was really on point
hiphopheads,removed,flexicution and the song with pusha are the only songs i can see myself revisiting im definitely glad its not a retail project
hiphopheads,removed,never thought id hear marty randolph again
hiphopheads,removed,always love beats
hiphopheads,removed,praise be to yeezus i wish he could fsma yadig
hiphopheads,removed,my criticism might sound crazy but every now and then i couldnt help but pick up a drake vibe
hiphopheads,removed,is to logic what is to drake
hiphopheads,removed,i like logic he can flow but his topics are so limited and the sad thing is he seems content with his content and doesnt seen like hes changing anytime soon
hiphopheads,removed,does anyone happen to find out what that crazy sample is on bars of the chick or person singing in the background
hiphopheads,removed,i really hope starts to work with some other big artists hes one of the best producers in the game right now
hiphopheads,removed,i liked the first half ot wat a return to what i love about snoop but the second half was everything i hate about recent snoop albums
hiphopheads,removed,the switch up on slave ii is the exact tempo of the switch up on summer sixteen just wondering if anyone else noticed

hiphopheads,removed,httpthewatchseriestoserieatlanta
hiphopheads,removed,this is wrong completely i get called a coon everyday by niggas who scream at the police everytime they come by us and are willing to kill and rob dudes for literally nothing at all u right about the stats but it doesnt tell you how much more violence there are in the hood the of who kills who is the same but the number of ppl dyin is disproportionate as fuck ive noticed kids from the suburbs latch on to that its racist to say that we need to act better but if you talk to ppl living in it the only ppl who disagree are the ones doing the crime
hiphopheads,removed,i dont give a shit that you cant keep your attention for a fucking paragraph you adderall addicted adhd fuckhead kids like you are the problem if theres no memes you couldnt care less fucking knew you all would react like this but i know theres a few that will agree with me so you can personally go fuck yourself
hiphopheads,removed,hes not even my favorite its just like i have to be a fucking parent on this site because you people dont even fucking understand the most simple shit about other people that would only take the slightest bit of effort to figure out for yourself but its like the thought doesnt even occur to yall
hiphopheads,removed,hasnt been yall make this assumption every time lol i see this same comment every time a racial thread comes up
hiphopheads,removed,i thought it was bill gatess brother or something
hiphopheads,removed,today im just gonna go on and skip the comments and go on and have a nice day
hiphopheads,removed,literally spit my drink out so thanks
hiphopheads,removed,kevin speaks truth
hiphopheads,removed,
hiphopheads,removed,of course it always fucking comes to this shit how the fuck do you figure im a troll because i dont fucking meme it up for you every chance i get kill yourself you fucking idiot i mean what im saying
hiphopheads,removed,if black lives mattered the vast majority of homicides would not have gone unsolved in chicago last year instead of helping solve these crimes and get murderers off the streets they just stay quiet and let it happen kevin just stating facts
hiphopheads,removed,we go from pharaoh kings who built the pyramids and traveled space to having to fight to not get killed by police really makes you think
hiphopheads,removed,the sad truth is the blacks kill far far more blacks than police
hiphopheads,removed,lol white people always playing the victim card
hiphopheads,removed,here
hiphopheads,removed,uh am i the only one whos going to point out it links to moon mans got money in the bank
hiphopheads,removed,this one is prettty good
hiphopheads,removed,those were the days
hiphopheads,removed,try this httpyoutubevnzxfnexiyc
hiphopheads,removed,almost better than httpyoutubevnzxfnexiyc
hiphopheads,removed,httpyoutubevnzxfnexiyc this one probably takes the cake
hiphopheads,removed,this one is also quite nice actually though it was the same person lol
hiphopheads,removed,i havent looked over all the statistics and to be honest im not totally sure where i fall on this debate but is it at all possible that white people commit more crimes but they are profiledinvestigated less so more get away leading to the overall number of crimes committed by white folks to be lower sorry if the phrasing is bad i mean lets say white people and black people commit crimes if only of white people are investigatedpulled over you end up with crimes on the books for white folks if even only of black people are investigated you end up with crimes on the books for black folks therefore despite white people committing more crimes the incarceration rate shows blacks as the worst offenders
hiphopheads,removed,mods salty af with this tag lol
hiphopheads,removed,can we have a source that isnt notoriously right wing biased
hiphopheads,removed,double platinum with no features
hiphopheads,removed,now if i fuck this model
hiphopheads,removed,i expected more of this sub but im not sure why anymore youd think hiphop listeners would more readily understand this stuff but nope
hiphopheads,removed,lmao your username is so inappropriate
hiphopheads,removed,im dead sitting here like who in thee fuck is kevin gates nothing in the top neva heard of im
hiphopheads,removed,we cant be a true fan of hip hop if you dont support blm blm is the worst movement for blacks as it pushes scapegoats show me evidence of institutionalized racism
hiphopheads,removed,yesterday started out so shitty woke up to no paycheck in my bank account because my supervisor flat out didnt get the checks cut in time cents to my name going through family stuff got an email a couple hours later for a job interview and my friend loan me a couple bucks as well feels great i thoroughly enjoyed that gucci intro for his new album not a gucci fan but im really interested to hear the rest of the album
hiphopheads,removed,it takes more courage to say what gates is saying than anything said by blm its not about black and white or even about police its a movement created by the misery of those who choose socialism and government dependency over hard work and the american system even whites get caught up in the socialist system sometimes and they pay the exact same price of perpetual poverty failing education and brutal police encounters the answer isnt to ask police to change its to get a job make more money and get off the governments handout system but with voting for democrats of the time i dont see that as even a remote possibility in our lifetimes blacks will be stuck dependent and broke unless something serious happens in the culture like taking kevin gates seriously
hiphopheads,removed,fuck blm they are a hate group as much as the next 🐸☕

hiphopheads,removed,this is crazy edit anyways this reminds me of the time i saved young chop from getting robbed it was just after one of his concerts i was at during the concert i was randomly selected to see him backstage after the concert so i went backstage to young chops room and found it closed i was getting a little frustrated waiting for him and was about to leave when i heard harsh voices through the door i put my ear up to the door and heard multiple voices telling someone to give them all the valuables i stepped back and kicked the door right open inside there was four dudes young chop and three dudes i didnt recognize two of them had knives and one of them had a gun one of the guys with a knife came at me but i managed to catch his arm mid thrust and using my elbow to smash on his arm i disarmed him i delivered a brutal karate chop to the guys neck and he was on the floor instantly the second guy with a knife stood there stunned giving me time to give him a full force uppercut to his jaw knocking him out instantly the last guy put his gun to young chops head and threatened to shoot if i didnt surrender i started talking to him in order to stall for time when eventually young chop took his chance and twisted the gun right out of his hand and put the gun to the robbers head he looked at me and said i better leave before the police showed up i just nodded and said good luck young chop and started to walk out when he told me to stop and said call me jeffery my nigga

hiphopheads,removed,of course there were wack rappers in the and some of them sold a lot of units too however that does not mean that there wasnt a big difference between then and now back then the wack bubblegum pop rappers were viewed with real disdain while the artists who young rappers looked up to were on some hardcore shit this has been almost completely reversed in the environment of the early someone like young thug would have been laughed out of the room and destroyed kind of the way pm dawn were for being a faggot and not just young thug kanye west would have suffered the same fate after and heartbreaks if not in the hands of established names some upandcoming rapper would have seized the opportunity to call him out for making a purely pop album today young thug is widely acclaimed almost everyones music aside from niche markets aiming at recreating the spirit of the is full of autotune and many have stopped rapping altogether and moved towards a kind of singing that is basically indistinguishable from the bubbegop synth pop garbage that the industry produces i see no real difference between fetty wap on one side and miley cyrus taylor swift and the likes on the other hiphop used to be a fresh alternative to the homogenous commercial mainstream airwaves this has been not only lost but normalized to me that is a huge problem

hiphopheads,removed,how is it bias if thats just what i believe trust me im not just spitting someone elses opinions out ive listened to his music read through lyrics both more than id like to admit and even watched through interviews to truly figure out why i dont like his music because id like to say im a pretty open guy i can generally listen to whatever anyone throws on im not super picky but i am a huge fan of hip hop its basically what i live for ffs youll have to refresh me on where i dismissed his success hes fairly successful and a known name in hip hop not sure about the music world in general but hes definitely made a name for himself no doubt i respect him as a person he seems like a genuinely decent person
hiphopheads,removed,
hiphopheads,removed,hes got
hiphopheads,removed,you can tell this subs demographics just by looking at these comments i mean way to go for the most obvious and corny joke
hiphopheads,removed,hes got
hiphopheads,removed,kanyes gone too fucking far this time goddamnit when he butchered wolves i defended him when he shoddily fixed it i still stood right by my captain like a good lieutenant should when he changed the life of pablo repeatedly i defended his right to do so its his art he can do with it as he wished people said to me oh ucallsouttheblue what if a painter hung a portrait in a gallery only to come in a day later and add more brushstrokes isnt this a musical equivalent to george lucas and his constant reediting of the star wars movies how can you say that there is nothing wrong with this but i smiled and i shrugged and i said hes just keepin it loopy man you know hes gonna keep it loopy for months i bit my tongue and it wasnt easy no i was tested tested repeatedly over and over frequently and constantly did anyone really think i didnt see how hours was ruined not once but twice of course i noticed it but i didnt breathe or type a fucking word because i stand by those i love even if theyre wrong i was trying to keep my faith even though i was looking for more when you become a follower of yeezus you cant simply be a fair weather believer when the waves hit rocks you dont stop being a wavy dude goddamnit but this is too far round and round champions call it what you will because clearly this fucker doesnt even have a solid title and im sure itll be changed at least five more times the fucking spineless fraud has been ripped to shreds shreds people call this a completed song are you fucking kidding me ive sat back and ive watched and ive spectated ive wanted to stay impartial ive not wanted to condemn and i thought no not just thought i fucking believed that i wouldnt need to be the one to pull the trigger that everyone else would see how mauled this masterpiece had been and how the only thing cruel about this winter was how sadistically kanye if you can even call him that anymore has tortured these oncesterling silver and gold songs but that didnt happen and now here i am i didnt want to do this i didnt want to be the one dont blame me motherfuckers blame yourselves for lapping up this piss water and calling it guinness draught blame yourselves for sucking down this dogshit and proclaiming it to be chocolate ganache blame yourselves for mistaking what is not just a violation but a rape a rape i say of your ear canals for a pleasure of an encounter this song is fucking shit this song makes me long for those sweet late summer days of september this song is so offensively bad that i retroactively cant even listen to my beautiful dark twisted fantasy without weeping and trashing my apartment in an aggressive fit of rage while biting my girlfriends legs and spitting her skin into her face because clearly that dark twisted fantasy was of ruining what could have been a goat of a banging track and the only way anyone could mistake it for beautiful was if they were sadomasochists both intent on torturing the ears of those around them while simultaneously torturing themselves how it is that nobody performed an honor killing of kanye in the studio while he aborted the beautiful fetus that was this song is beyond me i now know why people shoot abortion doctors the other day i was trying to fit this womans vagina around a plastic tube so i could get the starved rat i was keeping in a cage up inside of her when all of a sudden my spotify shuffle made a grave mistake it had the audacity to play this song if you can call an intense torture of the ear canals a song this is supposed to be the same thing as beethoven truly honestly have you no morality you fucking heathens i ended up cutting the bitch in half with a chainsaw and while i held her bottom half by the legs above my head like some trophy i laughed yet i felt no joy from this beautiful and wholesome family activity of mine her son was tied up in the closet looking through the slots as a good boy should and i was just about getting ready to change into a nice suit all armani very stylish before heading off to dinner reservations i had with my secretary jean that song had ruined it i tracked down the people who put together the streaming algorithms for spotify after that happened i mailed them each cigar tubes containing the fingers of their children among other gifts lets just say that mistake of playing that abortion of an excuse for four minutes wont be happening again i dont know how it ever got to this folks i used to love kanye i used to love kanye i even had the pink polo i thought i was kanye but now now i just dont even know how could a human being who calls themselves a good person or even a person at all perform such a horrific act as torture as unleashing something this repulsive upon us dont you people see the isis recruitment videos using this song dont you all fucking get it donald trump plays it at rallies while hes taking dollars from yall yet you still defend it you still stand by it i believe in a just and loving god i know when we die we will all be judged for our behavior now im not saying im a saint but i know that i havent done anything as morally reprehensible or unforgivable as ruin a nearmasterpiece as badly as this fucker has if you all want to follow this bitchboy into the gates of hell you all go right ahead but dont expect me to join you ive done nothing as repulsive as removing the most inspirational lyrics i have ever heard big boy in the morning proclaimed so triumphantly and joyously and replacing them with lines like couches couches couches you all drink saltwater swill and mistake it for a fine wine not i goddamnit have some selfrespect you imbeciles im fucking disgusted may god have mercy on you all because i sure as shit wont

hiphopheads,removed,romeo and juliet is a play written by william shakespeare which is set in verona italy in since then there have been many adapted plays and movies like the famous baz luhrmann movie in this essay will show how shakespeare entertains his audience through his use of character language and drama romeo has to face the fact that he has married a capulet and tybalt is hunting romeo down to fight because romeo snuck into the party the purpose of the humour at the beginning of the scene is to entertain the audience when he enters the tavern and says god send me no need of thee and by the operation of the second cup draws him on his drawer when indeed there is no need it can be argued that mercutio is making fun of tybalt by saying he is fake manly like getting drunk and going into a fight mercutio is there to put some humour into to the scene too so it does not get too gloomy tybalt wants revenge on romeo because he showed up at the capulets party tybalt wanted to throw romeo out but lord capulet stopped him and let him stay then lady capulet got angry at lord capulet for yelling at tybalt so he wants to earn his honour back by killing romeo boy this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me therefore turn and draw romeo does not want to fight tybalt because he is tybalts kingsman because he married juliet tybalt does not know that so he wants to fight romeo becomes enraged when mercutio dies and wants revenge on tybalt they fight and romeo kills tybalt romeo becomes very sad and when he becomes very sad his anger comes out so he kills tybalt when benvolio tells romeo that mercutio is dead romeo says this days black fate on more days doth depend this but begins the woe others must end this means that romeo fears that the evil outcomes of the violence of mercutios death lies in the future this foreshadows the end of the play when romeo and juliet die when tybalt wants to fight romeo who declined mercutio fights in romeos place romeo tries to stop him by pushing away tybalt comes in and stabs mercutio under romeos arm when mercutio finally realizes he is dying he says ask for me tomorrow and you should find me a grave man the word grave creates the pun it could mean that romeo will find him to be a serious man tomorrow or that he will find that he is dead and in a grave tomorrow the scene ends with the nurse telling juliet that romeo is banished from verona and that he will never come back if he does he will have to sneak back undercover the nurse tries to persuade juliet to go and marry paris and that he is a lovely gentleman or romeo if he is as good as paris romeo does not live in verona anymore and juliet will not get to enjoy him when the nurse leaves juliet talks about the nurse behind her back because she does not agree with what she said juliet and the nurse have a good relationship because the nurse acts as her mother from when she was a baby the nurse acts in a motherly way with juliet in act scene juliet tries to convince romeo that the birdcalls they hear are from the nightingale a night bird rather than from the lark a morning bird romeo has to leave before morning comes or be put to death juliet says the light is from a meteor rather than the sun this explains that juliet wants romeo to stay but romeo says he needs to be gone before dawn or he is dead juliet does not treat her mother as a mother she was never there for her it was always the nurse since she was a baby she treats the nurse more like a mother than her actual mother dramatic irony is shown when lady capulet comes into juliets room finding her crying at the balcony lady capulet thinks juliet is still crying about tybalts death when in reality she is crying about romeo leaving this is dramatic irony because lady capulet thinks juliet is crying about tybalt instead of something else the audience know who juliet is crying about but a character in the play does not an example of romeos use of metaphors is in this quote which compares night and day to happiness and sorrow some say the lark makes sweet division this doth not so for she divideth us this means that the lark does not make a couple come together but divides them juliet symbolises light because she can be out in the day in verona but romeo cannot because he can die romeo is the dark so the dark foreshadows their death because romeo goes to see juliet at the wrong time when she is faking death so he goes to buy poison to suicide right beside her juliet wakes up at the same time as when romeo suicides so she takes the sword off of romeo and kills herself too basically romeo is the one to blame the death of both of them this essay looked at how action character and language was shown in two scenes in the play romeo and juliet to entertain an audience now we know that tybalt wanted to kill romeo because he made tybalt look bad in front of everyone and to get his honour back he wanted to kill romeo i did not like the play as i am not a fan of plays and the genre of romance the message of the play is that if you love someone very much you do not mind killing yourself when they are dead to be with them for the rest of eternity

hiphopheads,removed,pretty disappointing pretty boring throughout
hiphopheads,removed,i feel like ivy isnt getting much love thats easily my favorite track anyone else
hiphopheads,removed,it gets better and better with each listen my favorite tracks are self control ivy solo reprise and pink white
hiphopheads,removed,i love it its a great conceptual multigenre album and i see where its heading
hiphopheads,removed,i dont even skip the skits on this album facebook story is so real and its so pleasing to listen too
hiphopheads,removed,i honestly think this is soft rock and i love it
hiphopheads,removed,liking it more and more each listen love how different it is from channel orange just wish there was more drums
hiphopheads,removed,the production on the vocals and guitar are better than anything ive heard
hiphopheads,removed,a masterpiece in songwriting plain and simple
hiphopheads,removed,pink white seems like it could have been on channel orange which might be the reason why its my favorite song on the album
hiphopheads,removed,so is there another album coming out too
hiphopheads,removed,its simply beautiful
hiphopheads,removed,it feels incredibly selfindulgent to me and i fucking love it
hiphopheads,removed,its blond
hiphopheads,removed,cant get enough of self control does anyone know who sings the chorus
hiphopheads,removed,lmfao you kids are all so fucking fake the album is bad you waited four years and he delivered edgy shit that is mostly spoken word or an attempt at rapping i never heard him say nigga on channel orange do you know what i mean
hiphopheads,removed,the third verse on futura free is the best thing frank has ever made it flows so well and the beat is so good
hiphopheads,removed,itt people recognise its a slowburner but still know there is quality yet insisting that theyre the only person capable of this conclusion and everyone else is hating on the project nobody is
hiphopheads,removed,it was ok
hiphopheads,removed,not seeing a lot of mentions of self control in here which is probably my favorite song of the album alongside nights and pinkwhite
hiphopheads,removed,good guy is far and above anything else on this album
hiphopheads,removed,self control is seriously one of the most touching pieces of music i have ever heard its unreal
hiphopheads,removed,really like pinkwhite and seigfried but not really feeling anything else on here
hiphopheads,removed,the only complaints i have are the interludes i hate interludesskits on any album though they almost never add anything
hiphopheads,removed,migos gave complex the exclusive link so i took the soundcloud private link off their page heres the link to the original complex article premiering the song
hiphopheads,removed,httpimgurcomagodwta
hiphopheads,removed,whats the vocal effect that frank uses in close to you its literally the most beautiful thing ive ever heard
hiphopheads,removed,o
hiphopheads,removed,heres an always working stream only in case others go down
hiphopheads,removed,why dont you guys just add a link of rleakthreads or something to the sidebar that way people can know where to find links and not spam this sub
hiphopheads,removed,wasnt that good imo but i did enjoy it
hiphopheads,removed,pink white and nikes are standouts so far
hiphopheads,removed,so relaxing so dreamy love it
hiphopheads,removed,if only apple music didnt have the fucking exclusive does anyone know when spotify will get it
hiphopheads,removed,it feels like an album of interludes
hiphopheads,removed,it gets better with every single listen
hiphopheads,removed,the screams at the end of ivy scare the fuck out of me i may not listen to that song
hiphopheads,removed,nights into solo reprise hits pretty sweet reminds me of a raury track
hiphopheads,removed,interested in what people think about the end of self control being earl and nakel smith talking any chance it could be them theres a scan of nakel in the magazine so i dont think its entirely impossible
hiphopheads,removed,nights goat tier song
hiphopheads,removed,frank ocean has more devout followers than jesus christ and i understand why certified next level rb see yall in two weeks
hiphopheads,removed,didnt like it every song felt like it went nowhere

hiphopheads,removed,if this album gets me some pussy ill give it a
hiphopheads,removed,i think its pretty lame that i have to click the controversial tab to find any comments critical of the album i really enjoyed blonde but i do like to hear both sides of whether or not its a good album
hiphopheads,removed,ivy solo and white ferrari are the only stand out tracks for me nikes is decent too i guess
hiphopheads,removed,this deserves the same amount of cultural significance as dark side of the moon it is absolutely incredible
hiphopheads,removed,hope youre doin well bruh
hiphopheads,removed,nothing on blonde matches the catchiness of channel orange im surprised to say that thats not at all a bad thing
hiphopheads,removed,update this shit dreamy af
hiphopheads,removed,update my boy frankie you came threw
hiphopheads,removed,anyone else think it could have used a well placed earl feature
hiphopheads,removed,shoutout to you guys for making it new by default as opposed to top
hiphopheads,removed,halfway through the album but i got a lot of lonny breaux collection vibes from this maybe its just me
hiphopheads,removed,i liked blonde more than endless endless was great but blonde was what i needed to hear
hiphopheads,removed,im currently pushing through my first year at a federal academy and this was much needed this is exactly what i wanted from frank smooth beautiful music i
hiphopheads,removed,i cant believe yung lean sang on the self control track
hiphopheads,removed,a lot of concept and art with none of the content and structure channel orange had
hiphopheads,removed,its so homogeneous and im loving it the first two tracks over all
hiphopheads,removed,first impressions very good different from co for sure but really really good
hiphopheads,removed,is this how frank always is never listened to him before this just so slow and dull
hiphopheads,removed,😴
hiphopheads,removed,isnt great are you kidding me
hiphopheads,removed,i already posted a comment but i want to continue on a small note i love everything hes doing with pitch on this project the high pitch parts of the album are so buttery to me thats about it lol saying it again i love this album
hiphopheads,removed,i havent listened to it since i am broke at the moment but stupid question probably but i thought the album was supposed to be called boys dont cry
hiphopheads,removed,we like it now but when will we decide we hate it who has to give it a negative review for the mob to follow

hiphopheads,removed,peach panther is the long delayed follow up to jody highrollers debut album neon icon no longer signed to diplos mad decent label riff returns with a trappier more southern album but its still the riff we all know and love if you didnt keep up with the promo run for this album youre missing out peach panther freestyle love the beat on this one riff opens the album up with his traditional brand of insanity he doesnt say much on here tho carlos slim what a banger mafia bring an insane beat to this banger the hook is memorable and you know this would only work with riff only in america yikes at the use of i have a dream speech to be honest its cringey at best til jody is american the part about professional snapchatters and teachers being battle rappers was funny to me million not feeling the hook at all tbh fambruh 👌🏿 riff should not be using autotune during verses it doesnt work and he doesnt need it since his voice is so recognizable chris paul classic melodic jody hook however the verses were just ok to me would be better if he went for a more melodic flow for the verses syrup sippin assassin what a great song basically all one hook also a very interesting beat all i ever wanted ft dolla bill gates not liking this one much the feature does nothing for me i drive by ft gucci mane danny brown very catchy hook from gucci but its pretty easy to see its an older one danny does his thing too mercedez ft geazy j doe surprisingly one of my favs hook is good riff brings some funny ass bars and geazy is actually pretty good on this track i dont like to think ft problem im a big problem fan and he didnt dissapoint on this track funny when he calls jody a pinkhaired cracker shout out to the bay ft king chip nice mustard style beat riff was ok nothing special betcha didnt know ft lil durk fki beat is dope i really like the hook and hope and jody work together more going forward durks verse is good imo but nothing exceptional from him in conclusion riff brings bangers on peach panther but only boring trap ones the beats on this project are waaaaaaaay too repetitive league of stars are great but they shouldnt be the core of this album riff doesnt overstay his welcome with most of the songs around min and only of them its a fun album but not as good as neon icon its too average for my taste fav tracks syrup sippin assassin i drive by ft gucci mane danny brown mercedez ft geazy j doe least favs million all i ever wanted ft dolla bill gates riff raff peach panther neon nation corpation bmg rights management trap southern rap versace
hiphopheads,removed,caitlyn is chest up as well
hiphopheads,removed,take that with a grain of salt though they just try to finesse anyway to make you money if you arent sure about where to go right now a community college isnt your worse option till you get a chance to improve your transfer application then get into a school that youll really want ive been in your shoes that instead of taking a quick step back and looking at my options at more depth not saying you did that and made the decision to attend a school that even though ive made great friends i dont consider the education stellar for the cost but im too deep into transfer also if your credits exceed your sophomore year and you can be considered as a junior transferring will be hard even though youd have attended for years on paper youre a junior

hiphopheads,removed,ive been having a hard time processing my feelings since election day its been an inevitability that hes going into office but it hasnt seemed real to me every day i wake up and my phone just blasts me with another illustration of the kind of man trump is and its disheartening every single time not so much so because hes that kind of person i mean can anyone expect any different after seeing the manner in which he was raised and came up but more so that no one seems to give a shit i mean how can anyone support this man then go home and face the women in their life how can someone support this man then go to work and feign respect towards their coworker who are undoubtedly composed of women and people of color the guy is not fit to run his own company let alone a world superpower and i dont know why people cant wont see that the worst part is that i cant do a goddamn thing about it i voted but my vote has never really counted in texas ive emailed and sent letters to senators but that hasnt really mattered since the people in power couldnt give half a shit about what some millennialminority has to say especially when goldman sachs is on the other side with a briefcase full of money its exasperating as someone relatively new to politics and i wish i knew how i could honestly make a difference or at least keep something like this from happening again
hiphopheads,removed,oh also today marks the day i can finally say i bagged the shorty ive been crushing on since i was like shoot your shot gentlemen you never know im on mobile someone link intl players anthem in celebration pls

hiphopheads,removed,i think when people say things like that they mean the increased amount of gay people being shown on tv obviously its more acceptable now but a lot of people feel like characters are written as gay to push a gay agenda and make people accept it tv influences people so i can see how they do the mental gymnastics to think it is turning people gay

hiphopheads,removed,when people say drake is a culture vulture i feel like they are more talking about the way he bites on actual different cultures like making all these songs with caribbean beats taking on the accent and tings and before that it seemed like he tried to take on gangster culture talking about how he started from the bottom and is all hard and shit imo this is pretty different than just jumping on hot trends or artists as kanye or any other successful rapper would do but at the end of the day i dont really care as long as its good music 👌

hiphopheads,removed,does depression last forever
hiphopheads,removed,legs hanging out the phantom
hiphopheads,removed,i have a couple of rants to go on neither of which are really hip hop related the first one is the antiveganvegetarian attitude so many people have why do people find it just preposterous that someone would possibly want to be a vegan how does their diet effect your day the idea that every vegan goes around stating their vegan is just untrue its impossible to know how many vegans you have met and then subsequently having them let you know that they are in fact vegan i hear waaayy more people complain about the fact that vegans exist than i have ever heard someone say that theyre vegan im not even a vegan or vegetarian i just dont understand how so many people give a shit the other one is that it seems like there are a few users on here im not gonna name anyone that seem to love to be contradictory just for the sake of it if every one of their opinions is contradictory thats fine and i obviously cant say for sure what their true opinion is but when every comment i see by these people is just the opposite of the ops opinion it just rubs me the wrong way probably more so than it should but i guess i dont really know how someone can hold an opinion that just happens to be the opposite of the norm without being an angsty teenager
hiphopheads,removed,man comments like this fuckin disgust me do you got a fucking mom daughter or sister

hiphopheads,removed,quick lets use this thread to discuss coloring book
hiphopheads,removed,🙁
hiphopheads,removed,
hiphopheads,removed,he deleted the tweet nah thats hhhs mods
hiphopheads,removed,😂😂😂😂
hiphopheads,removed,rhhh mods are on a constant power trip
hiphopheads,removed,why are the threads locked
hiphopheads,removed,took me hours to listen to it over and come to the conclusion its worse than acid rap way worse
hiphopheads,removed,ok what the actual fuck is this 😂😂😂
hiphopheads,removed,
hiphopheads,removed,cause it sucks and they are getting paid to remove criticism
hiphopheads,removed,just go over to rchancetherapper
hiphopheads,removed,thread deleted in
hiphopheads,removed,yo wtf is with this bullshit deleting anything chance related it makes literally no sense for essentially every comment to be deleted then the thread locked on the coloring book thread then the mods lock chances own fucking thread and delete the comments what the fuck is that then to delete every individual song posted from the album yet on the very same night post malone releases his mixtape and the comments are kept thread isnt locked individual songs from the mixtape are allowed to be posted hell even views dropped and the thread didnt get locked nor did the commentsfor the most part get deleted its literally the same thing literally anyhting chance relatedeven an article regarding the apple exclusive was deleted dude literally just asked if the album would qualify for a grammy and mods deleted it within seconds without even giving a reason for it all i dont blame them for deleting and not allowing reaction threads it happens with every album i also dont blame them for deleting all the posts bitching at the mods about it but those would have never happened if they didnt delete comments and locking the threads but hey look at this shiny new initial reactions thread so you can forget about it all
hiphopheads,removed,what the fuck is with the mods last night locking every thread chance thread and deleting literally every post related to chance locking a thread chance himself made not cool you nazis anyway someone on rchancetherapper compared it to tlop as in loyal chance fans will love it and but a fair amount wont like the direction his music is going i completely agree with that i love it and im a huge chance stan but i will say that it wont live up the expectations most people set for it especially after hearing acid rap and day even though people shouldnt compare them since its obvious chance has changed and has found the direction he wants to go ill also note that there dont seem to be many tracks that stand out incredibly like how on acid rap and day every track was so unique and memorable
hiphopheads,removed,why arent any of these threads sticking mods waiting for positive comments or what
hiphopheads,removed,oh fuck im gonna get killed on downvotes arent i

hiphopheads,removed,because of the reality of itreliability its easier to be homophobic than it is a killermurderer how often do you bump into killers or hear someone you know is a killer how often do you bump into someone that is homophobic also rap has glorified killing for decades not necessarily to the same extent but still and while thats the case it doesnt mean that theyre actually out there doing it anymore the likelyhood of them actually being killers is low but them actually being homophobic in this current day is still pretty high if they have it in their lyrics i think its really just the likely hood of them actually being homophobic is higher than them being a killer and that bothers people more because they know that and they have a stronger stance on it now vs before atcq had some homophobic lyrics back in the day but they stopped it as did many rapperspeople the times have changed and you dont wanna limit your money

hiphopheads,removed,im afraid to ask what sort of views you have about consent if you think the man alluding to maybe releasing something once means he owes you an album thats my point the fanbase is being immature as fuck ive used the example before but look at radiohead they didnt even announce they were working on an album they just slowly started deleting their internet presence and within a week released an album there was no communication they did the total opposite and disappeared people straight up acting like they own frank and its their right to be told what hes doing with his life

hiphopheads,removed,people here are in love with rappers whove shot killed and sold drugs lol youre looking at this wrong first hhh isnt a single entity second i think most of us like raps with a story and with strong literary andor figurative lyricism or just shit that sounds good and bangs lil dicky is viewed as wack to many probably because he doesnt have subject matter in many of his raps the same problem some have with logic futuristic and backpackers comes off as corny and subtly mocks the rest of hiphop kind of like hopsin embraces the fact that he is a meme kind of the problem many have with lil b the only thing i have against dicky is that he recycles verses so much and cannot go off the dome as well as not having much of a subject sometimes his xxl freestyle came from a song off professional rapper bruh that was also half of his freestyle on sway which half of was from another song who knew also comparing dicky to kodak isnt right they do different types of music so get judged on for the style they try to do

hiphopheads,removed,i prefer channel orange overall
hiphopheads,removed,dude on facebook friends probably hates zuckerberg lmao
hiphopheads,removed,with my unpopular opinion although i thought the album was good i really felt like i enjoyed tory lanez album a lot more and the hype of franks really didnt live up to what i was expecting
hiphopheads,removed,this is perfect for getting high watching the sunset music def something that meeds to be played through headphones to be fully appreciated
hiphopheads,removed,holy shit does andre deliver
hiphopheads,removed,i waited years for this album so if anyone rates it anything but a im going to be mad
hiphopheads,removed,theres a ton of really interesting things happening on this album but where are the drums a song like siegfried couldve been greatly improved by some soft drums
hiphopheads,removed,i hope the booty thing malay keeps teasing is an album full of bangers thats what i want
hiphopheads,removed,dope
hiphopheads,removed,tell me that isnt a nba street vol sfx at the end of nikes u cant
hiphopheads,removed,will endless be released as an album not that visual stream stuff
hiphopheads,removed,sorry if this is the wrong place to ask is there any mention yet of spotify i know all the apple releases kind of just slowly show up there
hiphopheads,removed,just straight beauty
hiphopheads,removed,i wish it was more upbeat
hiphopheads,removed,futura free is amazing the transitions the throwback of audio franks real talk this was so worth the wait deserves best album of and im not exaggerating
hiphopheads,removed,personally i liked endless better but its been a damn good weekend for music
hiphopheads,removed,if alabama on endless had trap drums it would be the banger of the year that piano melody has a lot of potential
hiphopheads,removed,id lowkey let frank ocean ocean over my ass
hiphopheads,removed,ivy is especially deep to me right now i cant tell if the album is this good or it just sounds better at this point in time first impressions are though its incredible
hiphopheads,removed,how important do you all think it is to listen to the album front to back
hiphopheads,removed,i wanna listen to a version of blonde without the skits
hiphopheads,removed,its a masterpiece
hiphopheads,removed,i havent been able to digest the album as a whole yet but ivy got me in tears man
hiphopheads,removed,frank and i would be friends thats why i like it
hiphopheads,removed,its short too short i waited too long for a project this short that being said i enjoyed what i heard the andre track was really good overall a very good project but i just felt it was missing some length i feel like we havent heard the last from him for the yearjust a hunch
hiphopheads,removed,does anyone else find the synthy backgrounds to the skits and the end of futura free just gorgeous i was very happy when it kept recurring and closed out the album
hiphopheads,removed,this album is way better than i thought it would be it lived up to the hype the contrast between nikes and ivy really impressed me
hiphopheads,removed,meh
hiphopheads,removed,my uncle dis aint hip hop boi
hiphopheads,removed,bold and tantalizing
hiphopheads,removed,phenomenal
hiphopheads,removed,seems kinda like yeezus for frank albums i like it a lot tho
hiphopheads,removed,so did anyone else think that the french guy was in the wrong
hiphopheads,removed,what if dyke rap becomes a thing in
hiphopheads,removed,ima keep it short and direct frank did a good job the sound kind of takes me back to nostalgia ultra sometimes and im curious to see if what andre said was really towards drake
hiphopheads,removed,its certainly not that endless bullshit and for that im thrilled looking forward to a more focused listen tomorrow
hiphopheads,removed,i swear he said i wanna fuck tupac in futura free i still fuck with it
hiphopheads,removed,i wonder if anyone is trying to clear up all the noise at the end of futura free id love to hear what the answers to the interviewers questions were
hiphopheads,removed,i have thoughts on this but it just doesnt matter our opinions just dont matter
hiphopheads,removed,i like the album art alot
hiphopheads,removed,videos in this thread videocomment listened to it about times now in the car headphones stereo absolutely loving it usually if an album is all fluff the hype wears away after a few listens with me but if anything im enjoying it more i love the variety in sound we got i really like this album still finding myself bemused by it in many ways so i dont feel like i can comment on it just yet one thing that really does stick out to me though is the recurring theme that is heard on all the skit like tracks sounds to httpsyoutubecomwatchvffzrmouzqre you should try listening to some of his epssingles theyre mostly instrumental and i honestly prefer them to his albums i think theyre a lot more experimental and innovative if you like electronic music definitely give them a shot heres a few everyones different its a shame though you should try out his earlier stuff as it lacks his vocals although its more electronic i really dig all of his work here im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
hiphopheads,removed,nostalgia ultra cant be topped
hiphopheads,removed,after i heard the original wolves on life of pablo i wanted more of that frank ocean turns out this is that album

hiphopheads,removed,reading through the comments this album may not be for me
hiphopheads,removed,do not smoke marijuana
hiphopheads,removed,it sounds like a bon iver album
hiphopheads,removed,definitely a charismatic album the more i listen to it the more i love it
hiphopheads,removed,is it worth buying or should i wait till its on other streaming platforms

hiphopheads,removed,is anyone else sad about the cancellation of the nightly show with larry wilmore i know there was a thread about it on the front page and reddit was doing their usual bullshit complaining about bbut he was racist towards white people not everything has to be a race issue but i thought he had one of the funniest most genuine talk shows on the air
hiphopheads,removed,too soon
hiphopheads,removed,someone on rfrankocean chopped it up and posted it recently
hiphopheads,removed,its more about coming to meeks city and talking shit about him while meek cant do anything about it its a bitch move imo drake is in the wrong for starting shit again meek is on probation of course he cant do anything serious its easy for him to talk shit then run out of philly with swat and police also meek cant respond on a track rn either cause hes not allowed make music as per terms of his probation
hiphopheads,removed,i cant get enough of that device control outro i never got into electronic music like that but that song fucking dings
hiphopheads,removed,yes in more than one way
hiphopheads,removed,at the risk of sounding hyperbolic fanboyish or circlejerkey new english is like the pinnacle of this genre for me literally all i want is turnup beats with a shit load of adlibs ive never felt that way listening to music before new english made me feel how big quint feels all the time i was literally sweating bobbing my head and dancing uncontrollably also plug for rdesiignerpics

hiphopheads,removed,yeah but drakes is a tad nicer thats what hes sayin anyway
hiphopheads,removed,literally the only people out in the south in the were kast and goodie mob idk about you but if there are only artists making music i dont think you can call it the regions peak once again you are confusing visibility and commercial success with quality of music which is completely inexcusable in newsflash we dont depend on the radio and the charts to tell us what is good music and what isnt we have this thing called the internet this is why it is even more infuriating that people are behaving as sheep to an even greater extent than before i dont really care what you think about its a classic it has a couple classic tracks on it that does not make the album a classic mixtapes albums its irrelevant again its your opinion that theyre weak doesnt change that theyre critically acclaimed and important they have never been critically acclaimed critics loved to shit on gucci until very recently first because he was a trap rapper from the hood second because all they heard from his was the albums which indeed sucked as i mentioned before not the mixtapes now they respect him more but i still have that lingering suspicion that it is more because of how influential he has been over the scene and how he directly helped launch the careers of others rather than because of his own music unfortunately those others include the likes of young thug the very literal embodiment of hiphops turn towards outright faggotry over the last few years and it is artists of that sort that the critics are most fond of because theyre experimental and innovative the mixtapes were indeed very influential but once again they were mixtapes with classic tracks sprinkled among filler they dont have the coherence and consistency of a good album gucci is a legend agree in what category i said that gucci is a legend because of the trap music he made but a majority of his output is in fact bubblegum rap and tpain is definitely an influence ye and wayne didnt invent autotune absolutely tpain started it however tpain akon and the likes were rb singers so it was somewhat excusable kanye was the first nominal rapper to make an entire album of autotune garbage

hiphopheads,removed,if they really want to start a change then how about rappers start talking peace and stopping the violence instead of worshiping guns and drugs and murder that would be a very good start shit could change in a generation or two if people actually tried to change it nobody really wants shit to be fixed though they like drama and controversy and hashtags
hiphopheads,removed,because they kill each other more and commit more crimes and violence against police
hiphopheads,removed,as a white person you cant do anything the black community has to want to change for things to actually change
hiphopheads,removed,thanks for the input quentin miller

hiphopheads,removed,chase said francis sampled his own track to produce summer friends for him
hiphopheads,removed,really cause im looking at that scene and the reason they even had that scene was cause he randomly complained about how niggers are so stupid he may not have been the most racist person youre right really cant remember but he seemed to have issues but i would have to watch it again to say
hiphopheads,removed,think he shitted but he barely even farted
hiphopheads,removed,so will jay elect cancel his appearance in a few days then 😂😂😂

hiphopheads,removed,
hiphopheads,removed,youre a dickhead shut the fuck up
hiphopheads,removed,cuz wayne win
hiphopheads,removed,why wont dre just do his own album
hiphopheads,removed,white people smh
hiphopheads,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
hiphopheads,removed,coming to hhh to post modern rap is shit might as well go to rthedonald to say trump is a cuck
hiphopheads,removed,im pretty sure travis said he was influenced more so by the metal style and culture than the music he couldnt even name a single metal band he was into in that narduwar interview and im pretty sure he had on an iron maiden shirt dont quote me on that last uflyharvey
hiphopheads,removed,well besides the fact that he more then likely raped lil wayne as a little kid amongst other things he got him hooked on drugs to keep him under control and he refuses to pay his artist cause hes a greedy bitch hes what you call a handler dude is fucked in the head and needs to be taken out
hiphopheads,removed,bitch i might piss on yo family
hiphopheads,removed,waiting till fandango has an opinion
hiphopheads,removed,really good but rodeo is still better so far
hiphopheads,removed,i just broke up with my girlfriend from high school weve been together for a year i know it was just a highschool relationship but i really loved her more than i thought i was capable of and it just sucked cause it wasnt like we had an argument or anything its just we are going to colleges in different states im in cali shes in michigan theres really no point to this post this shit just fucking sucks and i needed to vent
hiphopheads,removed,httpsimgurcomasdiiw
hiphopheads,removed,pick up the phone is still great love that song
hiphopheads,removed,waiting for this dusty apple exclusivity to end so i can hear the album myself unless someone has a good link
hiphopheads,removed,first project other than blonde this year that lived up to the hype imo
hiphopheads,removed,im just saying whats going to happen
hiphopheads,removed,nav has one of my favorite moments on the album where should i direct my attention for more of his work
hiphopheads,removed,through the late night is the greatest song of all time
hiphopheads,removed,will i get banned for asking for a link
hiphopheads,removed,fck apple though
hiphopheads,removed,goosebumps through the late night pick up the phone coordinate outside
hiphopheads,removed,im petty and shitting on someone for asking a question about their thoughts on someones body of work man i better just never post again just to appease you
hiphopheads,removed,great album but i have a humble request can someone edit the album art so his eyes look a little less googly like make them less white so they dont pop out as much
hiphopheads,removed,kendricks feature caught me off guard with that part with the high pitched vocals good shit tho
hiphopheads,removed,tiller makes me feel some type of way
hiphopheads,removed,so i dont know shit what does mcknight actually mean
hiphopheads,removed,blac youngsta coming through as always
hiphopheads,removed,birds fucking rocks exactly what i expected from travis
hiphopheads,removed,this album sounds good but travis cant come up with clever lyrics for his life
hiphopheads,removed,biebs in the trap biggest track on the album
hiphopheads,removed,i get those goosebumps every time
hiphopheads,removed,bittsm is really good but it doesnt come close to rodeo at all cant think of an artist whose debut is their best project other than nas
hiphopheads,removed,really enjoying it definitely living up to the hype however i wish there were more maria im drunk or type bangers still though awesome album definate
hiphopheads,removed,i havent heard it yeti just got some quick questions a whats the mood b does it bang c whats a track youd play while working out i need this one kinda urgently
hiphopheads,removed,disappointed as fuck its really average such a boring safe release from travis
hiphopheads,removed,honestly people knock travis a lot for delaying his albums but the production quality and overall mastering of the album is always worth the wait
hiphopheads,removed,the whole album just sounds the same to me rodeo is much better
hiphopheads,removed,seems like the coordinate beat is really similar
hiphopheads,removed,listened to it about times yesterday his best work since days before rodeo
hiphopheads,removed,out of the new frank ocean party sremmurd and everything else to come out in the last month this has impressed me the most
hiphopheads,removed,travis and young thug performed at my school on friday and then birds came out the next day so i may be a little biased but this album is fantastic i didnt think i would like it more than rodeo but since it dropped until now thats the only thing ive listened to travis finally found and crafted his own sound and its great favorite songs have to be the end way back sweet sweet lose goosebumps outsidei like the whole damn thing la 🔥 did his thing on this one
hiphopheads,removed,straight fire pitchfork will hate it bc they will still naively think hes a biter one of the most listenable rap albums ever
hiphopheads,removed,better than his debut and prob his best project this far along with days
hiphopheads,removed,trash
hiphopheads,removed,we really eating with this album didnt fuck with my either ty travis
hiphopheads,removed,one word bangers
hiphopheads,removed,i am satisfied it was worth the wait and i think travis really tried to be great with this one he was very very close imo
hiphopheads,removed,i need a version where the vocals dont clip
hiphopheads,removed,it still blows me away possibly my favorite album of the year next to coloring book the features specifically cudi and kendrick blow me away every time
hiphopheads,removed,is spotify dead when it comes to hip hop or what almost none of the big releases gets on there until like a month later
hiphopheads,removed,when is the project gonna be on spotify
hiphopheads,removed,wonderful is my favorite track on this album so far the weeknd is just so damn great on it
hiphopheads,removed,so when will this shit come to other streaming services because i havent listened it yet fuck apple
hiphopheads,removed,most of it has already gotta old to me tbh but a few of em do bang standouts the ends coordinate thru the late night goosebumps outside
hiphopheads,removed,really like the album even tho it felt ehh on the first listen loving the kid cudi and nav feature
hiphopheads,removed,the situation sticky
hiphopheads,removed,amazing best work yet i only hoped for more bangers like late night and outside
hiphopheads,removed,lose is the new
hiphopheads,removed,mixing is horrible album has good songs and so much potential but its holding it back drastically
hiphopheads,removed,i love it i think its consistently good great features and no boring or out of place sounding moments for context i didnt like rodeo and loved dbr
hiphopheads,removed,amazing
hiphopheads,removed,please dont ban the initial threads
hiphopheads,removed,its aight
hiphopheads,removed,good album also thanks to kenny for the shoutout
hiphopheads,removed,beibs in the trap is incredible nav really showed off his sound
hiphopheads,removed,does anybody else love that the features were unlisted it was like seeing matt damon in interstellar every time somebody popped in just pleasant surprises almost makes me wish wonderful and pick up the phone werent singles
hiphopheads,removed,goosebumps is amazing bryson tiller on first take is great too
hiphopheads,removed,i think lose might be the catchiest song on here love the whole vibe of the track
hiphopheads,removed,
hiphopheads,removed,bittsm rodeo fav songs the ends way back coordinate beibs in the trap outside goosebumps guidance not including singles previously released
hiphopheads,removed,dbr birds rodeo
hiphopheads,removed,the album was great but the mixingmastering was absolute fucking shit which really irritated me
hiphopheads,removed,theres no true travis bangers i miss his aggression
hiphopheads,removed,i really like goosebumps but i also really like biebs in the trap i think its underrated
hiphopheads,removed,big if true
hiphopheads,removed,what does birds in the trap sing mcknight mean though
hiphopheads,removed,coordinate is my shit rn
hiphopheads,removed,dope fucking artist dope fucking features dope fucking beats dope fucking album
hiphopheads,removed,sick in bed with mono and i dont have apple music fuck exclusives man
hiphopheads,removed,very few of the songs sound fresh i feel like ive heard all of these songs already
hiphopheads,removed,link before the ass eating mods take it down
hiphopheads,removed,youre retarded
hiphopheads,removed,it feels like traviss own if youre reading this its too late to me a filler album
hiphopheads,removed,that andre though
hiphopheads,removed,i think its his best project yet he honed in on an interesting dark vibe and was at least serviceable on the verses
hiphopheads,removed,i payed for a month of apple music spotify user for this and franks new album it was a great decision goosebumps is a personal favorite like the cudi feature weeknd fits great on his track pick up the phone is a known banger really dig this album
hiphopheads,removed,the abundancy of mattress references are getting to me i love this album
hiphopheads,removed,this and isaiah the only reason i got back on here for a min what a week for hip hop both albums fire glad to see theyre getting love
hiphopheads,removed,is it just me or does the coordinate beat sound like a remix of bossed up
hiphopheads,removed,its awesome college party type music which i think is exactly what travis is going for
hiphopheads,removed,link before the ass eating mods take it down
hiphopheads,removed,in really diggin sweet sweet
hiphopheads,removed,i dnt want another discussion the album isnt has good as u bootygoons think it is best project is still barter n jeffery has got to be my least favorite project of his
hiphopheads,removed,i didnt really like rodeo outside of the singles but i was surprised to find myself really liking this album
hiphopheads,removed,classic
hiphopheads,removed,this album is fire wtf its not a bunch of auto tuned cornball shit
hiphopheads,removed,this thread isnt needed
hiphopheads,removed,idk who nav is but his verse stole the fucking show
hiphopheads,removed,kill urself pls
hiphopheads,removed,its a really good album but i just feel it doesnt have any standouts like rodeo does
hiphopheads,removed,savage kendrick lamar
hiphopheads,removed,i think its biggest downfall is thugs tendency to just talk about the same things over and over again
hiphopheads,removed,wyclef jean harambe and guwop have all stuck with me kanye west too great thugger project
hiphopheads,removed,wyclef jean might be my favorite thugger song he rides that reggae rhythm so well
hiphopheads,removed,smoke some drink some pop some
hiphopheads,removed,wyclef jean is a fucking bangerino
hiphopheads,removed,am i the only one who felt uncomfortable when kendrick did that weird as voice
hiphopheads,removed,cant stand the album to be honest auto tune is not my thing
hiphopheads,removed,is this seriously apple exclusive
hiphopheads,removed,all the people that complained about the album taking too long are now saying it is too rushed hahahahahahaha
hiphopheads,removed,any non apple music streaming links my phone is incompatible for some reason
hiphopheads,removed,i like the album the only thing i dont think fits on here is wonderful i love the song but i thing the album would end better on guidance

hiphopheads,removed,rhhhs favorte phrase work ethic
hiphopheads,removed,classic mexican rapist line before anyone someone says shit dude people are rapists despite fucking race thats not a factor he thinks its a racebased attribute to even mention but he explains in this video that crime and rape arent just coming from mexico but from all over the world and that is technically true and coyotessmugglers do commit crime and rape women as they cross the border so your point is refuted like seconds into this video that you linked doesnt hire many minorities for higher positions he says that he isnt even the one who does the hiring like sentences into this article plus whats it fucking matter hire based on merit not based on skin color regardless of this simple philosophy of merit based hiring it says later in the article that the companys hiring dept is beginning to incorporate more diverse employees this article is just clickbait trash that has no real point to make and refutes itself he called supporters who beat up a homeless latino man passionate trumps racial incitement has already inspired hate crimes two brothers arrested in boston last summer for beating up a homeless latino man cited trumps antiimmigrant message when explaining why they did it donald trump was right — all these illegals need to be deported one of the men reportedly told police officers trump did not even bother to distance himself from them instead he suggested that the men were wellintentioned and had simply gotten carried away i will say that people who are following me are very passionate trump said they love this country and they want this country to be great again they are passionate this is the truth though these men were passionate and presumably not very intelligent and they did something wrong they were charged up and they were racist and stupid trumps racial incitement has already inspired hate crimes what a ridiculous statement classic media mental gymnastics these things are completely out of trumps control he never said we gotta beat the shit out of all these damn latinos we see around these people interpreting it that way does not mean that it was trumps intended message some stuff from huffington post httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyseotdfxwy would discriminate and not rent out to black people and was brought to court the government contended that trump management had refused to rent or negotiate rentals because of race and color it also charged that the company had required different rental terms and conditions because of race and that it had misrepresented to blacks that apartments were not available donald testified repeatedly that he had nothing to do with renting apartments although in an application for a brokers license filed at the same time he said that he was in charge of all rentals turns out he was actually following his own protocol here not based on race he has a limit on the amount of people on welfare that could live in any one complex donald trumps shitty things he says on twitter i really dont care about inflammatory twitter comments he writes about garnering publicity and he is taking his own advice can i say how blind it is to ask this have you really not seen his demeanor online and in public to not be able to see that he has always been like this whats blind is to simply believe everything that cnn and all of these clickbait articles tell you to believe every single media outlet has an agenda its obvious that news sources like cnn and clickbait bullshit like gawker are biased towards the liberal agenda and the democrat agenda this has even been revealed by the dnc email leaks they pander to their audience so they reaffirm their views to make them feel secure and on the right side of history because it pays but to believe that theyre reporting the truth is just plan naive take everything with a grain of salt during an election cycle because most media is heavily biased towards the left and if you think this is just mmuh conspiracy talk understand that i am an independent voter i am not affiliated with the republican party i am not a devout southern christian or anything like that i hold many liberal and many conservative views socially liberal fiscally conservative pro amendment anti illegal immigration a fucking asshole like fuck dude how can you defend a guy for being a racist and a judgmental fuck who has no love for humanity once again this is just taking cnn bait hook line and sinker nothing suggests that he hates humanity and there is plenty of evidence to support the fact that he is not racist and plenty of evidence to dismiss all claims against him notice how it was never an issue until he ran against the democrats hes been this way for years hell easily do something for the publicity and then dump us in the trash if he becomes president if he does anything for minorities he fucking does it to look good not because he actually cares while i dont believe this about donald i do believe this of politicians donald is not a politician luckily if you think hillary clinton genuinely cares about you beyond the power of your vote or that most other career politicians care about you save maybe bernie youre being mislead hillary clinton is a great example of the current state of government in the us she is absolutely corrupt and she cares about nobody but herself her only goal is to be president and she will say or do anything to achieve this goal if you think democrats actually care about minorities you maybe need to reevaluate their position and their motivations just his actions are profane and the act of some narrowminded fuck who doesnt think about anything but himself as a trump supporter i obviously have a bias but i genuinely believe this is wrong donald already has everything he doesnt need to be president he has said in the past that he would never want to be president unless he were absolutely certain that he was the only man for the job he is risking his life to do this and i genuinely believe that he is doing it because he loves america and the american people he hates to see america go downhill like it has been he writes about it in a crippled america he is frustrated with the current state of affairs and is sacrificing a lot to try and make things better for us people aspire for his realness when his realness is to overexaggerate lie and be racist ive talked about the racism already so i wont address that again anyway he has realness because he is not a politician he does not speak like a politician is trained and programmed to speak he is a real person not a fucking politics robot from some corrupt dynasty like the clintons or the bushs so his fans are just like him if not illinformed or know little about politics this is just a flatout wrong generalization of a whole lot of people trump has a variety of people supporting him dont let the media convince you that theyre all klan member hicks from the south and year old men who miss the jim crow days illinformed or know little about politics ill informed is believing everything that the media tells you instead of digging to find the truth you have to think critically and see through the medias bias and understand how the real world works and how fucked everything is to convert yourself to a trump supporter like i did once i did that he was like a breath of fresh air i hate to use the term redpilled like some memer but once you redpill yourself on the world trump is the only option just a discussion no hate from me

hiphopheads,removed,i dont think the content of justins tweets determines whether hes a vulture or not but he always stood out from the rest of nsync and backstreet mostly because of his willingness to follow black trends and work with black artists that nelly remix was his idea iirc its why he was able to transition into a solo career he was more hip than his square bandmates i hated both those groups as a teen but that was pretty obvious from afar

hiphopheads,removed,this subreddit a joke when it comes to discussing something thats not just obvious lyricism because this doesnt fit the latest trend of basic as fuck mumble rap faggotry
hiphopheads,removed,thats true except its been a while since he switched up his style and abandoned this way hes been rapping i was hoping hed finally change flows again butnope same old boring ass robotic flow its been years surely these complaints have been brought to his attention hes definitely got bars for days but his delivery is way off he needs to rap on a beat stay more or less on flow repackage his bars and theyd have a better impact on people cause the way hes been rapping for years now its going over peoples head it was cool in the beginning but now its just likeok again with this shit i really hope his albums not like this
hiphopheads,removed,im not an eminem fan but im so glad he did this nothing like getting those racists on facebook who only listen to eminem yelawolf and lil dicky riled up that one of their idols condemns their racist beliefs also not trying to snide anyone who enjoys those artists thats fine just saying those people you know who they are who only listen to hiphop by white artists

hiphopheads,removed,obviously we should always listen when women say that someone raped them those are serious allegations and should be taken seriously but can we forget this whole rape culture thing for a moment and just be real with each other please because unless a woman gives a definitive no and physically tries to avoid sex whilst the man is forcing himself on her its not really rape now is it if were keeping it a glowing you cant flirt with a guy get into bed with a guy spread your legs and let him stick his dick inside you and then the next day say that he raped you because you didnt sign a contract saying i agree that frederick gibbs can insert his penis into my vagina it seems like thats what some people think nowadays

hiphopheads,removed,another fucking white boy with a shitty fucking mixtape if i had a mixtape for every single of you id like about twenty three hundred mixtapes and every single one was shit thanks for playing please try again this is shit too bro lol but at least it wasnt as fucking pathetic and cringeworthy as your track buried and this track right here is pretty much a result of my continual online harassment of you because its fun first and foremost but honestly because im telling you bro youre white you fucking retard you said you dont even like rap that is irreversible damage even fuckning eminem the most successful rapper of all time even he fucking understands that hes fucking white and has to be funny and goofy so be funny and goofy and stop trying to be serious because no one is going to take you seriously or respect you other than old white boys whose compliments you just eat up to feed your little precious ego unless you get shot niine times bro im still embarassed for you and this is shit son this is fucking shit you should be ashamed of yourself sir try again and im telling you have to go the humorous route you fickle fickle little boy pink guy ey can i habe da pussi
hiphopheads,removed,okay this is obviously probably gonna come across as sexist or nonpc but lets play devils advocate for a minute isnt it totally possible the girls backstage were groupies who totally willingly partook in some lean or some other drug that gibbs and his crew were also drinking willingly followed him back to the hotel had sex and then after the fact realized gibbs was an asshole using them as typical groupies felt a little ashamed and then decided to call it rape i just dont see why any internationally touring musician would ever really rape someone when they probably got a hundred girls at every show willing to be taken advantage of in exactly the type of scenario i just described and while that scenario would be a little scummy i definitely wouldnt consider it rape unless the girls were underage or took the drugs unknowingly groupies have been part of music forever andasshole gender roles were switched it definitely would be a non issue if rihanna picked me out of the crowd shared some drugs with me took me to a hotel then brought out the whips and chains was a total bitch to me then kicked me out theres still no way i would consider that rape because i really wanted to have sex with her before i even met her i probably sound like a mens right neckbeard advocate right now not trying to defend anyone or jump to any conclusions i just think the details of this sound a little fishy and some of the comments in here are making it out like itd be rape just to take advantage of a groupie who is throwing herself at you and willing to take whatever drugs you have when thats exactly what all of your favorite musicians have been doing since forever and even the reason a lot of rockstars are idolized
hiphopheads,removed,besides the part where it says it should be metro boomin featuring future because hes what makes the song

hiphopheads,removed,nicki for the cold nights or frank for the same reason
hiphopheads,removed,damn the racism is still alive and well here in texas i work for the city governments animal control and had a call for a snake and i can handle it easy so i went by myself to the home of the woman who called when i get there she takes one look at me and says i want a different officer to pick up the snake and i said maam im perfectly qualified to dispose of it for you i already have all the tools so she replies you better not step one foot in my house or ill call the cops im gonna call your job and have someone else come and take care of it im one of the only two minorities that works for the city and that shit being so blatant made me sad and disappointed and mad im legally not allowed to get the snake or even talk shit back to her either
hiphopheads,removed,how do you guys always get here so early for these threads lol even if im just an hour late or something theres always hundreds of comments here already
hiphopheads,removed,love this dude triggering hhh everyday
hiphopheads,removed,what is with all these blm lovers here fuck them
hiphopheads,removed,wheres ja
hiphopheads,removed,yall niggas love to hate the white man but yall love these white hoes tho smh
hiphopheads,removed,so i had a graduation party last night and it was all cool and shit but one thing is stuck on my mind a lot now basically ive been pretty intimate with a girl not in a way of banging her yet because well she has a boyfriend we danced talked all night long we hugged a lot and she was laying in my arms i wake up next morning and she pics with her boyfriend uploaded to fb with the love you so much stuff like nothing absolutely happened what the fuck could this mean am i on to something with her btw were not some strangers i tried my luck with her before she had a boyfriend and we had a party together where we only danced help me rhiphopheads youre my only hope
hiphopheads,removed,i doubt most of you watched the video but the main speaker not sure who that was gives a great point the problem with blm especially to those not involved in the movement is the name black lives matter of course all lives matter but what blm is trying to get across is that cops need to stop killing black people the title blm doesnt effectively get that across that being said gates is right about tons of black on black killings yet the nation really gets up in arms when a white dude kills one
hiphopheads,removed,well this thread certainly wont be a shit show
hiphopheads,removed,what kevins saying is true but really hes not the right type of dude to get this message out as seen in the comments no one takes him seriously and i cant blame them when he has or still currently is fucking his cousin has faced serious criminal charges its true though blm does not speak about black on black violence when its really by far the greatest demographic for black murders
hiphopheads,removed,ehhh okay so this is what i got from the video black lives matter is a dumb ass sentence and i agree with that because in my rational pov all lives matter and race isnt important so i would just say lives matter but since blm has become a movement that i support i get the phrase but i still dislike when people shit on other people who say all lives matter because i just agree with that sentence more than just race matters the phrase is just bad and should be removed because its putting in that us vs them factor and it doesnt help that minorities are getting upset when people say all lives matter anyway i disagree with gates because you can see that hes speaking from a very ptsd like point of view where be grew up in the ghetto saw fucked up things and is a bit anti black because for him the stereotype is just as true as it is for the redneck if not realer tldr blm is a needed and great movement but the phrase is fuckin idiotic and bound to cause conflict also gates is wrong objectively but knowing from what he came from you cant blame him
hiphopheads,removed,blm terrorists
hiphopheads,removed,kevin gates is a smart man so is kendrick when he wrote the last couplet on the blacker the berry black people are killing other black people at record numbers
hiphopheads,removed,dad found out i smoked weed a couple of times got angrier than i thought he would dunno wtf to do guys help
hiphopheads,removed,coon gates
hiphopheads,removed,bit racist
hiphopheads,removed,this thread eesh
hiphopheads,removed,good for him blm hasnt done shit for black people
hiphopheads,removed,white doesnt like blm is racist now i think black lives matter but i dont particularly like how the movement handles itself and cherry picks to support their agenda
hiphopheads,removed,i too start discussions and just dismiss them when i cant think of a response
hiphopheads,removed,call him what you want im not watching my back at the atm because of the police im looking out for niggas
hiphopheads,removed,why single out one race though its like if your parents said your brother is important you automatically go like hey wait what about me and our sister
hiphopheads,removed,agreed dude needs to chill has me annoyed when people cant just leave something alone but they instead have to try to look smarter than the other person when in reality nobody cares what this guy thinks not that people care what i think but thatd what im saying nobody really cares about peoples opinions when they try to act super smart with it
hiphopheads,removed,just copped islah
hiphopheads,removed,lmao
hiphopheads,removed,zybryhbzhxz t
hiphopheads,removed,lmao i thought this said kevin owens
hiphopheads,removed,i disagree hes saying some real truth here black lives matter what is this dont blacks just want to be considered normal people stop the racism so why pick them out as only black lives matter youre black thats awesome im white we are both americans we are both here together youre my brother im yours fight this with me dont do your own fucking propaganda by yourself with just blacks and fuck you spitting your black lives matter here over there over there go to fucking chicago go to detroit go to places where black on black crime is extremely fucking high how about you go educate your people about how their lives matter
hiphopheads,removed,luca brasi 🔥🔥🔥🔥
hiphopheads,removed,every one of yall are gucci fans until it actually matters lol smh pathetic i guarantee more than million people like gucci mane but a ton of yall new dumb kids are bandwagon fans that only know about gucci cause fucking free gucci turned into a meme most of yall probably cant even name of his tapes without googling it you expect all kinds of shit from these rappers but its a problem to expect only one million people to follow him its really not like it takes much effort
hiphopheads,removed,they stand for everything but that
hiphopheads,removed,lol
hiphopheads,removed,im sure theres a lot of whiteness im not seeing in hhh so im not gonna speak on that im not trying to get involved in this specific argument but overall its true blacks and whites have different cultures black people are dangerous as far as my life experience has gone its whites i see doing drugs and actually living homeless but ive been threatened by groups of black guys in the street for being white more times than i can count and thats real telling me to move up off the sidewalk its also true ive only ever seen whites shooting up in alleys and by dumpsters ive been backstabbed and disgusted by whites and blacks but anyone who has had life experience around different races knows we are factually different based on how we were raised in our own culture im not gonna make the i have black friends and all that justification but with that i do think black people are more violent dont mean i hate blacks and we cant get along but thats the judgement im gonna put on black people based on what has been consistent in my own life at the same time i totally understand white being labelled as sex offenders and uppity fucks those are true too i just want people to be honest with what the realities of life are not living with these fantastical ideals they read about on the internet with that said i think blacks and whites are most similar of any races in america we have the longest and most involved history together and despite the media painting the world black and white we still get along best
hiphopheads,removed,kevin gates can get in the shuck and jive lane right next to stacey fuckin dash

hiphopheads,removed,takes a drink artists like this are paid by the prison state to keep inmate population high they arent even trying to hide it anymore a single inmate generates per year for the prison industry more money than is generated by most albums the rap industry is not about selling music its about selling blacks on a criminal lifestyle so they get incarcerated do you have any idea how much money prisons make from locking up black people if you enjoy this music you hate black people and are actively encouraging the downfall of their culture and that is a fact i dont know a single black person stupid enough to like this garbage but i know a few racists whites who listen to it because blackface isnt allowed anymore

hiphopheads,removed,the distortion is on purpose you retards its supposed to sound like shit
hiphopheads,removed,the album feels way more solid and consistent than rodeo the only complaint i have is that the mastering could use some tweaks
hiphopheads,removed,fuckin stupid idiot
hiphopheads,removed,i think this is his best project yet i feel it had more lyrical growth compared to rodeo
hiphopheads,removed,i personally enjoyed it over rodeo by a fair margin hes done an incredible job
hiphopheads,removed,for a lack of a better word it is a stunning album my question is which is better this one or rodeo
hiphopheads,removed,im really liking this album but im super disappointed that black mass wasnt on there i was excited about hearing the full version
hiphopheads,removed,wish he would trust himself more other than that a very good album just wish he had more song solo
hiphopheads,removed,no doesnt happen to me and im an important singular subject in what constitutes the best of us
hiphopheads,removed,guidance is addictive as fuck
hiphopheads,removed,cant be mad at it it was a consistent album but i dont think there were many songs that really stood out eg oh my dis side

hiphopheads,removed,it single handhedly keeps black culture down or not
hiphopheads,removed,this is a fantastic project it was well worth the wait
hiphopheads,removed,i never really liked rodeo because of his slow paced rhyming but this satisfied my needs especially travis scotts homage to day n night wonderful will always be a banger too
hiphopheads,removed,speaking of endless does anyone know where i might be able to find a download of the spilt up tracks ive been listening on am but id love to be able to throw slide on me or sideways on a playlist

hiphopheads,removed,lets have a toast for the assholes
hiphopheads,removed,my school has absolutely lost its mind these past couple days a senior committed suicide in wednesday and some of those old as shit teachers were being hella disrespectful about it the student body wasnt putting up with that and now we have no tests or homework for today and monday administration had to make an official apology also we were discussing colin kapernick and his actions in english as a class and some kids were seriously being lowkey racist coming in with that all lives matter shit and saying that hes privileged so he shouldnt be protesting those kids were all white kids from well to do families pretty much every kid who was generation immigrants was calling them out for it also probably gonna make a post on khiphop in the sunday thread so watch out for that
hiphopheads,removed,god damn it hes doing it for people that dont have a voice and spreading the message hes not kneeling for himself why on earth would he do that
hiphopheads,removed,kaepernick is from modesto he didnt grow up privileged lol
hiphopheads,removed,breaking news my niggas if your girlfriend has went to any season opener basketball game best believe shes fucking some niggas on that team shes fucking somebody on the basketball team if shes at the game
hiphopheads,removed,dont you get it by now it doesnt matter if youre rich when people will still be racist and profile you as a black person questlove talked about how he is always getting stopped by cops to the point he specifically got a himself a less flashy car than he could afford so he wouldnt get pulled over and he still got pulled over the cop was assuming he stole the car and was suspicious when he was driving around late listening to the new music he had produced
hiphopheads,removed,do people not understand that there are inherent differences between how different races are perceived and treated in society regardless of how much money you have and anyway just because hes privileged now doesnt mean its always been that way and it doesnt mean he cant empathise with others who are in no way privileged
hiphopheads,removed,why do you need to know
hiphopheads,removed,i cant imagine many places in society where white people are always giving minorities strange looks get out of the house more
hiphopheads,removed,i cant imagine many places in society where white people are always giving minorities strange looks nigga where do you live

hiphopheads,removed,as a charlotte native theres no denying that there is a terrorist faction that exists within the blm movement i mean shit someone fucking spraypainted black lives matter on a shattered window of a store that had been looted the other night just like the tea party and occupy wall street poor leadership and and a lack of tangible goals has lead to corruption in what is otherwise a good movement
hiphopheads,removed,i cant imagine many places in society where white people are always giving minorities strange looks bruh
hiphopheads,removed,maybe he just wanted his chicken sandwiches
hiphopheads,removed,i really want to make money and help people at the same time and i feel pretty discontent with my major in finance right now i keep thinking about premed or law but multiple people keep telling me to wait it out for some time more i just wish i knew what i wanted to do sooner rather than later
hiphopheads,removed,no white people may actually kill each other at higher percentages httpusuncutcomblacklivesmatterblackonblackcrime
hiphopheads,removed,rates among impoverished people are similar regardless of race obviously rich white people arent killing each other at the same rates as poor black people
hiphopheads,removed,exactly this is one of the most cudi things ever hope the guy is doing alright seems to be on a rough patch lately
hiphopheads,removed,its a huge percent of crime
hiphopheads,removed,rates may not be the correct word calm down captain caps the point im making is that black on black isnt so unique yes its a problem in impoverished areas like the stories that come out of chicago i dont want my brothers killing each other when were so small a percentage in the country but pointing out black on black crime ignores issues that lead so many black people to living in impoverished areas white offenders attack white people at similar percentages i would be willing to wager that the same would be found across most races
hiphopheads,removed,🎶 and its obviouuuuuuus lol this song surprised me i like it

hiphopheads,removed,hilary bernie bernies a cuck trumps fat hilary machiavellian i like that in a woman
hiphopheads,removed,whats your goal by attacking my intelligence because now that you have called me unsmart my only option is to further entrench myself in my ideals and reinforce those opinions which in turn will likely be passed into my children and so on and so forth so by definition i have won because my vision will be passed on and multiplied when all you had to do was attempt an open discussion yet you pander to these evil people hiding behind a veil of so called oppression so again go fuck yoirself
hiphopheads,removed,yeah theyre here for our entertainment that doesnt mean that they should get rights
hiphopheads,removed,even more so why would you give money and time to someone that doesnt like you cudi sounds like hes bigoted i hate the word cuck but tbh it is kinda cucked to patronize someone who doesnt like you whatever the reason
hiphopheads,removed,hillary is corrupt is more of a meme than something based in fact spoken like a true retard
hiphopheads,removed,i mean the director essentially made this video what it is if there was no commentary and it was just b roll shots and thugger eating cheetos it might even be called a bad video so the director saved it i do agree the money burning idea is cool in theory but in execution just dumb

hiphopheads,removed,c u r r e n t y e a r u r r e n t y e a r
hiphopheads,removed,o shit my dick out
hiphopheads,removed,get buckets
hiphopheads,removed,you mean people like blm
hiphopheads,removed,yeah if i had a victim mentality complex i would see that too
hiphopheads,removed,shut up bro we are riding the antilogic circlejerk in this thread let it happen
hiphopheads,removed,its surreal that people cant accept there were different degrees of slavery and that facts arent racist you guys remember indentured servitude in many cases it was actually worse than slavery and in many cases it was races other than blacks he isnt defending slavery hes providing you information and context slavery is bad but slaves being wellfed and cared for is a lot different than slaves that were beat to death no
hiphopheads,removed,whats the point of complaining when someone mentions a part of history that is factual
hiphopheads,removed,theres nothing wrong with saying black lives matter just like theres nothing wrong with saying white power its the ideas and information being spread by the movement that makes saying it wrong the whole movement is predicated on the fact that black people are somehow being targeted by racist police
hiphopheads,removed,so youre mad because someone added info that offended you victim mentality
hiphopheads,removed,how was he making an excuse how is he supporting it you mean it sounds like that to someone with a victimmentality
hiphopheads,removed,how am i racist how are they unfairly targeted by police thats funny you talk about me going to a safe space when you want me to leave because im interfering in your space space the irony
hiphopheads,removed,wack miller
hiphopheads,removed,well you could answer my other questions if you werent such a little bitch
hiphopheads,removed,lol how is the burden of proof on me when no one has proved that police target black people and the stats everyone uses comes from the fbi ya kno
hiphopheads,removed,or you could suck a dick and explain how its racist
hiphopheads,removed,the white house was built by slaves those slaves were fed and sheltered an uninformed person goes hmm thats interesting i thought all slaves were treated like shit lemme google that
hiphopheads,removed,yeah op we all know your mom
hiphopheads,removed,ayyyyy
hiphopheads,removed,are you so fucking stupid that you dont realize different slaveowners treated slaves differently and that slavery wasnt all bad is not even the point of my arguments grow up dumbass
hiphopheads,removed,all lives matter not hard to understand not just blacks have injustice with police this is nothing but divisiveness with race
hiphopheads,removed,another factor as to why the police target a huge number of blacks is because they cause the highest crime rate simple as that people need to stop playing victim and address the massive deaths in chicago as well brothers killing each others is ok but when a cop kills a black then everyone loses theyre fucking minds
hiphopheads,removed,yall got any of them mirrors
hiphopheads,removed,i bet ur rlly original too huh im just waiting for your stupid ass to pull out a cuck or a triggered
hiphopheads,removed,you just typed out white power what a fucking racist
hiphopheads,removed,what im telling you is that history isnt black and white and why get offended if someone tells you that some slaves were treated better than others
hiphopheads,removed,there is an equivalent white power is built on the false idea that white people are supremacist black lives matter is built on false ideas such as that somehow racism is getting worse
hiphopheads,removed,big if true
hiphopheads,removed,how does context not matter of course it doesnt matter to you and idk how you go from me saying some slaves were treated better than others to me thinking slavery was good for them
hiphopheads,removed,shut the fuck up faggot and kill yourself ─ulowercasethoughts
hiphopheads,removed,where do i collect my if my opinion of blm came from the comments in reddit i would be joining the antiwhite circlejerk here
hiphopheads,removed,black people have never been shot because they deserve it
hiphopheads,removed,slavery quality of life isnt relevant to slavery got it
hiphopheads,removed,mirror mirror on the wall im short on patience come on yall
hiphopheads,removed,im sorry that you were taught by retards who dont put things into context
hiphopheads,removed,you dont think its a little strange talking about justice in a subreddit about a genre of music that frequently talks about criminal activities the same little hypocrisy you think you see in me you dont see it in your argument
hiphopheads,removed,you have to be retarded to not see the extreme amounts of white guilt perpetuated on this website
hiphopheads,removed,yeah youd still be complaining about police discrimination somehow
hiphopheads,removed,this whole thread is being pedantic dumbfuck
hiphopheads,removed,because the context hes trying to provide doesnt make what she said have less of an impact yet everyone here is upset because what he said somehow did this

hiphopheads,removed,j cole is not for everyone you need a certain level of intelligence to really vibe to his music most people will skip over the bars where he talks about his shit but you have to listen to the music closer even in the artistry of the beats and drums its much deeper than that people take things too literal its not quantum physics but from a standpoint of enlightenment hes the man

hiphopheads,removed,not publicly addressing a mass shooting doesnt make you a bad person using the word faggot in a rap song doesnt make you a homophobe either the j cole line is probably from the song viluminati and it is in no way homophobic eminem has had many controversial lines also but obviously the man is not an actual homophobe obviously being famous hes probably met lots of homosexual artists he sees as mentors like fucking elton john this article is fucking stupid and misleading

hiphopheads,removed,all the guy said was mixing needs help and makes it hard to judge and for real dont quit your day job you then ranted about whether mbdtf was properly mixed and mastered whether kanye should have given up his dayjob a guy who became a producer first and foremost to put bread on the table and then shoved some words in his mouth he didnt come close to saying so that your rage seems halfjustified you think kanye was quitting his shit to be a rapper this early on that of and tyler with all and then you bring up fucking martin luther king adversity is what made these people their ideas and ideals were honed in the fires of disagreement and struggle they werent undermined by it op isnt worse off for getting told his first project isnt paying the bills thats as absurd as your detached positivity in the face of reality ironically its the dicksuckers which derail greatness and creativity at least as j cole recently told it negativity is one of the greatest motivators there is if its so adversely affecting you or anyone and youre expecting the world to act as a bubble until youre good enough or ready you arent ready for that world response and have other problems to resolve
hiphopheads,removed,why didnt just put ft jhene aiko instead of lol how you feature yourself😂

hiphopheads,removed,so you want those size and they dont have them and no store has them and then you go to the shoes website to order them bitches but theyre out and when they restock they dont even the size you need and then the size you need disappears a few weeks later in the choices section and then you start to lose your fucking mind because it took you almost half a damn year just to cop some fucking flyknits and then motherfuckers in the government be talking some shit about ordering sweatshop labor knockoffs from some four year old little chinky eyed bitch off alibaba but why the fuck can she make size but nike cant like the fuck i feel you man especially when nike trying to make me pay for them bitches but the lil slave kids can make it for like a pair and all i gotta do is buy pairs of shit in different colors so i got like a hwole closet full of shoes made by the same people that make the nike ones but for like less than ten percent of the fucking price

hiphopheads,removed,i was going down on my girl when my watch beeped came running out and opened my laptop noregrets﻿
hiphopheads,removed,i been saying he was on his grind but this sub called him corny 🙄
hiphopheads,removed,i know were all tired of the election but im genuinely scared my cousin said theyre gonna put all us muslims in a national registry and honestly that seems possible also for people saying that the left provoked this election result by calling people racist heres the thing people who voted for trump may not believe they are racist misogynistic homophobic etc but at the end of they day they showed they value certain thingsthe reasons they voted for him over the safety and well being of minorities this shows they dont actually care about those lives they may not hate minorities but they dont care about us
hiphopheads,removed,this is why people cant or dont take the black community seriously knowing already im going to get downvoted to shit for this but statements like this caused more people to go out and vote for trump how can anyone take this community seriously when not only do you say shit like this but get upvoted for it do you understand that many areas of the us that voted for trump were the same exact ones that voted for obama last time
hiphopheads,removed,only further proving his point good job

hiphopheads,removed,i played this for my cousin now he cant even think straight

hiphopheads,removed,ladies and gentleman if i may id like to recount a dream i had just the other night i think it was a message maybe im just too hyped maybe its because i havent masturbated in about a month maybe it was just exhaustion from lack of sleep but the story unfolds quite nicely so this dream starts with a sand storm blaring right in front of me i couldnt see anywhere around me i was lost in this desert laying down not knowing what to do so i slowly rise i looked down at my hands and they were cracked and bleeding from the scraping of the sands and the ever blazing sun burning through the sandstorm in the distance i here start come on its just start playing in the background and i know i have to get out of the sandstorm but i dont know in which direction but i start moving south east west north i have no idea which direction i just walk forward start slowly fades out and im left in silence pure absolute silence even the storm was silent ive never been in a real life sandstorm but i do imagine a shit ton of sound to be emitted from a sandstorm i start losing hope of ever finding my way out so i kneel down and pray something i find myself never doing because i choose to be one of those asshole atheists who will laugh at you for praying not really but i like to say that i am my prayers dont seem to be heard so i collapse but then a thunderous crack is emitted and the sandstorm dies down all around me are pyramids eerily enough pyramids starts playing and its like a light show is coming from these pyramids and i cant keep track of the dancing colors because theyre hopping from one pyramid onto the next im so amused at how beautiful the change of scenery is and i start to spin in circles chasing the dancing colors and it comes to a sudden halt the world becomes tilted and i start sliding off then the world is upside down and im screaming clinging onto to sand holding on for dear life the pyramids go crashing down and the sand is trickling away im left holding onto one grain of salt that remains unmovable and im screaming i cant let go ill die i start thinking about everything ive done in my life everythings flashing before like my whole life in film just blurring through in fast forward until the end and i look at my last grain of sand with determination i let go and im careening through the air racing into outer space im bracing myself for impact with something with anything i close my eyes and im crying guilt failure and almost every emotion i can is running the course of my body and i cant help but cry after what seems like forever i open my eyes and im inside a house in front of me is one single step nobodys inside this house nobody its empty its serenity its serendipity my breathing is going back to normal im relaxed i have full control of what im doing i say fuck it and take the first step that first step was amazing its a symphony of something so unearthly ringing through the halls of this empty house that it sends shivers down my spine i have fucken goosebumps and this symphony is so beautiful its playing the fine tunes of my heart overcome with emotion for the beauty im listening to i begin to start crying once again i shake my head and look forward and as if from thin air another step materializes in front of me i know what i must do so i take the next step and even more music begins to play and with every step forward the music is unwavering its magic its too good for me its breaking me its giving me reasons to look back and run back because im not worthy of it but something tells me to keep going so i do as i progress further on this infinite staircase i become delusional and insane i start clawing at my ears because i am not worthy of what is being given to me im almost near the end my body can feel it the music is just piercing me at this point stabbing me and killing me slowly i reach the final step and on that final step a golden archway opens in front of me i reach for the handles i just want to get past all this i want to escape the madness of the goodness thats piercing me my tainted soul couldnt burden this heavy beauty and i see my hands bleeding much more than before but then my whole arm is bleeding from every pore of my body i am bleeding i am being showered in my own fucken blood i am insanely twisted i dont know how to react i have no emotion i cant even see the doors or handle anymore my eyes are dripping blood but some sudden clarity rings through me like an alarm reminding me of my goal and i open the archway and step through there he is standing before me god or at least i think it was god but as i get closer i start to see maybe its not god maybe its somebody else doubt races through me ive been tricked i need to get back on the other side of this archway if not im dead i look back and theres nothing but clouds behind me i must be in heaven im terrified but curious to get to this man standing before me so i walk to him he stands there in solidarity in silence in peace in calm in beauty in grace he turns to me and says come my son let me cleanse you you are filthy and full of sin i look at myself and see that i am covered in blood everything prior to opening the archway had happened it seems and i guess i must be cleansed i walk forward to my savior and he looks a little more inclined towards me he starts facing me i lock onto his eyes and its frank ocean staring at me he is god he is everything clean and holy and great and wonderful i collapse forward and he catches me he starts singing a beautiful song into my ear it was the same symphony that i had heard on the first step except now its clearer and more understandable he then carries me into a bathroom where he disrobes me and cleans me he showers me he makes sure that i am truly clean he hands me a bathrobe grabs me by the shoulders and smiles im dead locked into his eyes his power brings me to tears but he pulls me in closer and he

hiphopheads,removed,hey all forewarning this may be a bit of a rant i dont want to leave airsoft i love the sporti am however becoming jaded by the community as a whole some of you may recognize my name ive been pretty active here onoff over the past year and a bit i like to feel ive made an impact to new airsofters assisting with gear and specifically helping new canadian airsofters get good prices that being said im getting tired of airsoft a bit of a backstory i came from paintball most of our team came from paintball we are rough around the edges not so passive aggressive play and train hard from my perspective i dont want to deal with the airsoft community anymore its hard to explain but specifically many members of the community seem very two faced in paintball issues were voiced directly to the other teams and they were dealt with there and then at the end of the day the teams left the fields beaten bruised and respecting each other it feels now though that there is a lot of passive aggressiveness in the sport of airsoft nobody wants to deal with the issues at face value nobody wants to start an argument but everyone wants to have an opinion ive personally seen a lot of shittalking behind peoples backs including mine that it makes me sick members of my team have been accused of not calling their hits and then when i sit back and take the time out of my day to ref i dont see this at all nor do any of the other refs yet the accusations keep coming my guys play a very close game and we will not call unless they know theyve been hit were gunfighters a skill we got from paintball a skill which a lot of airsofters lack and quite frankly dont understand regardless i no longer feel the desire to airsoft every time i think about going i get a pit in my stomach worrying that i may have to deal with yet more bullshit worrying that ill have to deal with cheaters passive aggressive people who will refuse to have a discussion about the issues at hand and worrying about whether or not ill actually have fun because of this the last few times i was out i didnt have much fun ill explain why we recently went to a large op over the summer it was our first extended twelve hour op it left us all with a sour taste in our mouths we had no issues with people accusing us of cheating but many issues where the opposing team were not calling and were trying to create rules on the fly to better fit their needs because our team was dominating our team was tasked with holding a side of the field something were fine with however we were tasked with doing it nearly all day our guys decided to pull out because we had no batteries left we were tired thirsty and hungry i cant blame them and as a leader this is partially my fault for not directing proper breaks all this has effected me negatively over the past few months maybe ive been mulling on it for too long maybe our team is the issue maybe our own egos are the issue im not quite sure what it is but im no longer excited to get out and play and i want to be i no longer have that itch i used to have i want to once more enjoy the sport but i feel like something is preventing me from doing so
hiphopheads,removed,ccording to all known laws of aviation there is no way a bee should be able to fly its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground the bee of course flies anyway

hiphopheads,removed,you know people look at the internet and see everyone talking about harambe and some just dont understand why does everyone love this gorilla no one knew who he was before he was brutally murdered you know why i loved harambe so much and i still do to this day let me tell you i live near the cincinnati zoo and ive gone there many many times the first time i could remember going was when i was a wee lad about the age of we arrived at the zoo and saw some animals many creatures snakes sloths birds lions tigers giraffes elephants etc then we saw him the gorilla harambe as a little kid i remember gazing on him and thinking wow look at that gorilla hes beautiful and then he turned around and faced me and thats when i saw it his giant mega sized big black helmet i was breathless i desired it i needed it skip forward a year i am now and we go back to the zoo all day im yelling at my family to hurry up cause i want to see harambe they didnt quite understand why i wanted to see him so bad but i knew they just wouldnt understand so i wouldnt tell them it was around pm and the sun was beating down on us it was so hot we finally reached harambes home and i was just staring at him he looked at me and i was so happy then something crazy happened his giant big black helmet got bigger and harder it was amazing i couldnt believe my eyes and what i was witnessing i started to drool and i didnt understand why but when he looked at me i knew we connected somehow i am now and we visited the zoo again and we eventually got to the exhibit and i just couldnt wait to see him and his big black helmet i saw him and he saw me we glanced at each other once more and there it started to grow he ran towards me but hit the glass then he started to try and sensationally touch the wall thinking of me i was honored i couldnt believe i had been so lucky to have harambe love me and desire me i wanted to pleasure him but i didnt know how i never saw harambe after that day but i thought about him every night and then it happened that black night owl kid did what i wish i could have jumped into his cage i can only imagine what that kid experienced and how happy he was what happened next i cant even type without crying harambe was playing with the child and having a good time but because of the kids black fatass mother they opened fire on harambae why harambe did nothing wrong harambe was then protecting the child from the gunshots harambe died saving the childs life they killed the love of my life my idol my everything harambe was so attractive and had the nicest helmet i only wish i saw him more i miss him so much out of respect for what he did for me and what he showed me when i was dicks out for harambe

hiphopheads,removed,it should be noted that ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as i know that said in grade i took an sat test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area an iq test has shown me to be in the percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test my mothers boyfriend of years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of i understand physics better than him and i owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics hes not particularly successful as an engineer but ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it im also pretty good at engineering i dont have a degree and other than physics i dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy ive come across every question of existentialism which ive seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is psychology i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which i dont have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freuds theories im a good enough writer that im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the internet ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it i dont know if that will suffice as evidence that im intelligent im done with it though because id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii i would be against executing him in fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it id even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them i dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others i dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others but i dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them i dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc i know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things i love everyone even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone im pretty much a pacifist ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that the only time ill fight back is if the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and if i dont attack ill come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me i dont fight back ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that im never in a situation where ill be worse off after a fight if im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries i really dont care the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them id prefer to do that over killing them i consider myself a feminist i dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men and never participate in the old reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome that doesnt mean i look for places to victimize women i just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings ok when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that im kind of tired of citing these examples and im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far in closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the reddit brony community where i spend most of my time and where im pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so i guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments and uh im a pretty good moderator all that and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think now that you at least slightly know me

hiphopheads,removed,well the teen in his name pretty much implies he was raised on pc culture and everything that isnt sensitive to every single issue is either racistsexistbigoted in some form its really obvious in this chain who has worked retail and who hasnt this doesnt have as much to do with race though im aware that plays in here and so many other scenarios as it does the fact that hes a young guy who dresses in a way that generally carries a negative connotation and has a neck tat which pretty much screams i dont have a fulltime job i have quite a few tats myself but ones like that generally prohibit you from getting a lot of higherpaying jobsya knowthe kind that would make it financially feasible for you to be dropping in a department store

hiphopheads,removed,long story short kendrick sits on the couch in the green room covered in sweat its the last stop on the yeezus tour kendrick has spent the last months traveling across the country with his idol and mentor kanye west who was currently on stage right now the tour life can be exhausting and also somewhat lonely kendrick hasnt seen or been in contact with sherane in months and his young libido was still beating the road groupies sufficed for the time being but there was a hole in kendricks heart he needed more he wanted more he wanted kanye but he didnt know how to tell him kanye was married with children kendrick wasnt even entirely sure he was bisexual but after seeing kanyes interview on kris jenner he thought maybe he had a chance kendrick looked into the mirror and began to cry he knew that he could never have kanye he could never be with kanye hell he could never rap as well as kanye no matter how many syllables kendrick spit kanye always beat him all of a sudden kendrick jumped a little as he felt strong hands grab his shoulders and start to massage them lightly once he recognized the hands as kanyes he relaxed and let his mentor take care of him before he knew it trails of kisses were being traced down his neck and collarbone only being briefly interrupted as kanye slid kendricks shirt off of his chest kanye smiled and leaned into the caress kanyes lips moved to kendricks ear very nicely done tonight by the way he laughed a bit before nibbling on his ear lobe i fantasized bout this back in chicago he whispered seductively into kendricks ear kendricks only response was a soft moan as kanye pulled him back towards him so kendrick could clearly feel his growing erection pressed against him would you like some yeezy in your serato kanye teased as he kissed kendrick chubby cheeks kendrick grinned and twisted his head so he could reach yes lips to kiss him how do you say fuck me in spanish me no hablo they both laughed before they kissed again softly ye kissed down kendricks chest especially slowing down to pay attention to kendricks sensitive nipples as he sucked gently he looked at kendricks face the way that he bit his lip and squirmed under kanyes touch only egged him on further his hand slipped down to the bulge in kendricks jeans and gently started to massage it gently as his mouth still moved slowly downward as his tongue slid along kendricks abdominal muscles he undid kendricks leather jogging pants and helped him to slide them and his pyrex vision boxers down to his ankles so he could more easily kick them off kanye took the head of kendricks penis into his mouth swirling his tongue around it making kendrick elicit moans of pleasure to the sensation ye i know you want this dick he breathed as he moved his hips up to try to encourage kanye to take him in further ye removed his lips from kendricks head to lick along his shaft and take his scrotum into his mouth he gently sucked on one of kendricks tesitcles at a time making sure that he enjoyed the sensation but that he was teasing him just a bit he used his right hand to massage kendricks testicles as he again wrapped his lips around the shaft of his long slender penis he took as much as he could into his mouth having not managed to master the art of deepthroating yet and bobbed his head slowly up and down savoring kendricks salty taste and his every moan kanye fed off of kendricks pleasure doing his best to repeat every little thing he did that caused him to moan louder squirm against the couch or grip his hair tighter in pleasure kendrick moaned loudly again panting fuck ye im gonna fuck im gonna cum he exclaimed as his hips bucked releasing streams of hot sweet cum into kanyes welcoming mouth kanye did his best to swallow it all although a few drops dripped from his lips after swallowing what was in his mouth he greedily licked up the drops that spilled kendrick panted as kanye kissed up his chest more quickly than his earlier decent his lips pressed against kendricks greedily his own lust having grown from his pleasure derived from kendricks orgasm he pulled away gently from the kiss smiling down at kendrick is it my turn he laughed as kendrick nodded and stretched his neck to plant a kiss on kanye jaw all of a sudden both kendrick and kanye were startled by the sound of something falling in the closet next to them out of nowhere schoolboy q falls out of the closet with his pants down around his ankles and his dick in his hand schoolboy had been in the closet masturbating to ye and kendrick the entire time schoolboy jumped up screamed gonorherra nigga skeet skeet and ran out the door kendrick kanye nor schoolboy ever spoke of the event again

hiphopheads,not_removed,im so hyped for this since hes working with doc mckinney who is the main producer of bot house of balloons and thursday
hiphopheads,not_removed,so great to hear from him really thirsty to see what hes been up to the last yearish since couch potato and excited to have shlohmo on production the no more ep is still my favorite jeremih project to date expecting equal dopeness from these two
hiphopheads,not_removed,a match made in heaven happy to hear that hes back
hiphopheads,not_removed,really looking forward to this dude has a phenomenal voice and shlohmo is an excellent producer gonna be a great combo
hiphopheads,not_removed,why the name change spooky black was awesome
hiphopheads,not_removed,corbin needs to blow up also wheres bobby raps tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit this sounds amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,apparently hes dropping a double album this year according to some guy on ktt
hiphopheads,not_removed,i fucking love shlohmo one of the best shows i saw when he came to portugal
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is the best news ive heard all week without u is one of the greatest songs ive ever heard cant wait to see what this sounds like
hiphopheads,not_removed,remindme months
hiphopheads,not_removed,i loved the jerimihshlohmo collab more than anything either artist has done solo i hope shlohmo can recapture a similar magic with corbin
hiphopheads,not_removed,omg i love them both this is going to be such a good collab d
hiphopheads,not_removed,bout to be a snooze fest
hiphopheads,not_removed,where the video of frank crooning in a minnesotan winter in a black doorag thats art
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh for sure when that was announced i got real excited spook is headed for big things
hiphopheads,not_removed,iirc he picked spooky black as a joke and when things started to get more serious he changed to corbin
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably because it sounds incredibly racist
hiphopheads,not_removed,spooky black is kind of racist edit lol im not joking why the down votes
hiphopheads,not_removed,chilling with some beef stroganoff
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes in la working with a lot of people
hiphopheads,not_removed,not just some guy someone at fyf fest heard it from spook
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah its a double album it wont be this year a little birdie who knows psymun tells me months
hiphopheads,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of months to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn bro bad vibes is the only album i have a vinyl of places ep vacation ep and bad vibes are all amazing projects you should check them out
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,dunno if he made the right choice im used to it by now but corbin isnt a very distinguishable stage name
hiphopheads,not_removed,his rap name was lil spookyikes
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have no doubt that it was unintentional but like holy shit yeah it really is on more than one level
hiphopheads,not_removed,what about the name was racist
hiphopheads,not_removed,have listened to all those still prefer the no more ep by a solid margin
hiphopheads,not_removed,jeremy corbyn gon be mad for this one
hiphopheads,not_removed,well searching for corbin on youtube mainly shows his songs as a result
hiphopheads,not_removed,he really wants to move past spooky black he doesnt perform without u at all if you think about it hes he doesnt want to be defined by some shit he did at years is a long time at that formative of an age he cringes at that shit now
hiphopheads,not_removed,spook noun a ghost a spy a cia spook a contemptuous term for a black person
hiphopheads,not_removed,but without u is so good
hiphopheads,not_removed,im glad he changed his name though i always thought it didnt sound quite right
hiphopheads,not_removed,chance gonna tweet out good now that you up why dont you go to church
hiphopheads,not_removed,prob just a music vid boys dont get too hyped
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes on the frank album bet
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably telefone from noname that would be my best bet
hiphopheads,not_removed,could it be the gambino x chance ep or am i trippin
hiphopheads,not_removed,i pray its frank
hiphopheads,not_removed,frank ocean gospel album confirmed coming out after sunday church

hiphopheads,not_removed,yea guys lets talk about yeezy instead

hiphopheads,not_removed,chief keefnobody ft kanye
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think there are very few things that are objectively true of any art theres what an artist wants and what an artist produces the only objectivity of it comes in how the artist translates his goal from mind to finished product the only way something could be objectively bad is if the artist decides the drums he is using sound wrong or the synth lead is off when looking at an album like trout mask replica by captain beefheart and his magical band youll notice many things sound off sonically life they make no goddamn sense if you look much much closer and have patience with the record youll everntually hear some sort of rythym however the goals of this project are not to produce something that sounds like anything youve heard before which the album excels at its okay not to enjoy this record or even make an attempt to understand it but it contains nothing objectively wrong similarly using your examples of lil boat and dark fantasy you have to understand what each artist is going for yachty and ye seek to achieve completely different things and therefore it makes little sense to compare the records in terms of a better rapper this can also apply what is the artist trying to do uzi seeks to use his bars in a completely different manner than doom while we can say that doom has much more complexity and certainly uses a more vast quantity of rhyme schemes than uzi that does not inherently make him better would dooms style of rap work well over charlie heat would uzi sound good over madlib and would either of those scenarios attempt to recreate the same goals of either artist or would they use their talents for other goals subjectively we can take opinions on it such as a lil yachty is hardly a rapper and the production is corny the bubblegum trap style is outplayed and yachty is merely an evolution of a ringtone rapper one that may fade out what kanye achieves on dark fantasy is groundbreaking he contains tight flows provides a plethora of incredible features and complex production and winds it all together into a tight and compact package bursting at the seems with groundbreaking style or b dark fantasy is a terrible album kanyes bars are constantly struggle bars the production is over produced and over stuffed with ideas kanye relies on his features to pull of the album and even still not all of them work lil yachty pushes the boundaries of trap music he is able to push the sound and make fun of everyone doing that type of music his bars are relevant and seemingly all too common with that of the genre but at a closer look seek to provide a singular insight have more fun lil yachty uses the same stylistic choices of many artists to provide a much deeper truth in his lyrics all riding over a glossy and refreshing production style that blazes a new trail for the genre now i dont agree with either sentiment but what these come down to is that one is better than the other the comparisons are very shallow but also contain the core problem they dont really understand the goals of the art they comment on the impact and the technical components but dont really get beyond a surface level so in short i believe that objectivity applies solely in the creation subjectivity is to the listener comparisons are only made to help listeners better differentiate one artist from another when discussing the music
hiphopheads,not_removed,now this is where it gets sticky for me and where im still unsure how i feel lets say person a and person b both agree that they both value metaphors double entendres complex rhymes and vivid imagery now with this prior information can person a say they still think that lil boat is a better album than lets say illmatic lil boat features almost none of the aforementioned qualities and illmatic is riddled with them i struggle to see how anyone who values all those things could honestly say that illmatic is worse than lil boat i realize that as im saying this im contradicting what i said earlier about music being entirely subjective but i think when common values are shared objectivity gets brought into it a little bit if complex rhyme schemes are your thing can you honestly say lil uzi vert is a better rapper than doom the thing with that is then it just comes down to number counting who done the most double entendres etc which would just mean its a case of which artist can stuff more features into their music which in my opinion shouldnt be a form of measurement whatsoever i think music is entirely subjective because it boils down to what the consumer finds musically appealing maybe a yachty fan preferred lil boat over mbdtf because it is more appealing to them in terms of sound but maybe they agree that mbdtf is more cohesive as an album and has more thought process into it but these are all beliefs that a cohesive album is a good thing people liked yeezus and tlop because it was so chaotic right basically everyone has their own opinion on what makes an album good person a might praise yeezus for experimentation whilst person b will say it sounded trash sonically and neglect the experimentation bit because to them it sounded trash i dont think theres any objection within music because then it literally goes down to statistics on liked features of a songalbum
hiphopheads,not_removed,the only true objective thing in art is technique and even that is muddy waters
hiphopheads,not_removed,art is open to interpretation therefor its completely subjective everybody hears music differently therefor everybodys opinion can be different someone can say that is the best album of the past years but who am i to say they are wrong no matter how out of pocket that opinion is it isnt an incorrect opinion i just dont agree with it thats one problem a majority of the people on this sub has they think that because someones opinion is different it must be wrong let people like what they like because we all interpret things completely differently
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like a lot of what you say a big issue i have with people here that jerk endlessly over lyrics who use complexity and rhyme scheme to swing around the term objectively every day is that simply some songs have their time and place if im throwing a party future is a great choice basic lyrics allow everyonedrunk people me to sing along if some asshat out of some sense of musical superiority throws on dance with the devil a song like that could completely kill the mood not only because of the subject matter but also because immortal technique doesnt lend himself to a party vibe same goes with new rappers like vert yatchy etc they have their place and while i like to obsess over themes in albums like gkmc and as much as anyone else here im not guna lie and say i dont like some ignantless complex rap i find myself listening to gucci and yg way more than i do to kendrick nowadays anyway i know gucci and yg have interesting stories and perspectives too but lets not pretend were not talking about madvillainy or deathgrips here in terms of complexity at the end of the day all music is subjective and even if you agree on defined criteria most albums still have that x factor something that is unique to that album that is hard to pin down i think in the areoplane over the sea is more complex and dense than most rap albums ive heard in the past years but guess how much i listen to it compared to lil yatchy or travis scott or drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think rap is unique because you can be declared objectively better at rapping than someone else thanks to the concept of battle rap if two mcs go head to head over the same beat then it becomes a lot simpler to judge who is better similar to how benny goodman and chick webb had a battle of the bands in the even though subjectivity as well as environment and emotional state of the mc still come into play i think rap fans as a whole are pretty good about declaring one rapper objectively better than the other thanks to this unique idea even better is when rappers beef and you can measure who is better than who over time however some things simply cant be settled for instance nas and jay z and imo this is how you know two mcs are at the top of their game
hiphopheads,not_removed,the aspects in rap that i think are objective rhyming ability with regards to multis the amount of effective literary and poetic techniques used in a given verse and how smooth and fluideffortless a flow sounds just about everything else delivery or how good the delivery and cadences sound in the final song how good the production sounds the quality of the hooks etc are subjective to me in its purest form judging two rap songs outside of how well the people rapped their verses with regards to technical rhyming ability is mainly subjective and is mostly dependant on the listeners tastes a lot of early somethings and teens online dont like anything before in most cases a lot of somethings and older may not like a lot of this modern trapmelodicvibes type of rap thats relevant today then you have your outliers in the middle and some people who like everything so its hard to have a uniform concrete factual view on a rap album outside of its commercial success and its influence on the genre imo that being said if the consensus across mediums and a cross music fans all over is that an album is well crafted i wouldnt argue that even if i didnt like it theres a lot of known classics by the culture that i just dont vibe with theres nothing wrong with not liking a respected art work or even liking a slept on or underrated art work until you try to force people and argue with them endlessly trying to make your opinion based on your individual subjective tastes and musical preferences seem as if its a indisputable fact of life that seems to be where the disagreements arise in online music discussion
hiphopheads,not_removed,there is definitely at least some objectivity in music just like in everything else would you blame an art enthusiast from become exacerbated when a person believes that a year old childs paintingscrawl is better than michelangelos best pieces of work it might be a subjective truth for that individual but theyd be objectively wrong it think definition plays a big part its difficult to define hip hop right now especially with all the innovations over the last years how do you compare artists today the quality of lyrics would be used as a yard stick for measuring an mcs skill in the past but now apparently bars dont matter as much as long as the mc is mumbling somewhat melodically over a beat its kosher do you blame uzi and yachty for constantly telling us that theyre not rappers but see themselves as a new type of rock stars why do we keep forcing them into identifying as rappers people like their voice and the personality they bring to a beat as opposed to what they are saying i would go so far as to say they are part of a new genre we are doing them a disservice by comparing them to mos def and mf doom if all the songs the new school releases are hip hop material then so is the track gold by kiiara so i would propose to compare like for like duuh lyricists with lyricists trap artists with trap artists swag rappers with swag rappers etc
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dislike a lot of these new school mumble rappers because i think it sounds like poop its not because im some backpack rapenthusiast either its because i dont think a lot of effort goes into it i compare it too porn ironically enough sure does this music tap into some peoples desires with the beat and the energy of some of these tracks absolutely my argument is that just because these artists do it it doesnt make it unique and special it just exists and if it wasnt yachty or uzi it would be another artist taking advantage of the inherent desires we have as human beings most people wouldnt even question that the most accessible aspects of these dudes movements are the beats that tells me that these artists arent unique at all but because their beats appeal to a mass amount of people they build buzz back to the porn comparison because the the lane appeals to certain desires the production value as in the generic artist on the track can be shit because the point of porn isnt to make good movies its too provide a certain arousal based on human desire so in the end i cant value judge it because of its inherent subjectivity but that doesnt mean we cant call a spade a spade
hiphopheads,not_removed,you raise a very good point with the idea of the artists intent being factored in i hadnt thought of it that way and i agree with what you said what do you think about the idea of sharing similar values of what is good but then seemingly going against those values when deciding whos a better rapper like with my mf doomuzi example if someone values extensive rhymes and wordplay but then says uzi is a better rapper would they be wrong i agree it is silly to compare artists like this im just curious about what people have to say
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats the issue with talking about the technical components of art like if anything thats its most subjective field if you are into lyricism like i am criticizing something for having struggle bars that pull you right out of the track is pretty valid especially if you site examples that being said before this sub freaks im not saying kanye had struggle bars on mbdtf for the most part
hiphopheads,not_removed,the hits of the and early prove you can have good rhyming and lyrical ability great flows and charisma and still make bangers that the people love to listen to as long as you dont over emphasize the lyrical part on some try hard shit i dont think the two realms between lyrical rap and party turn up rap have to be apart i think those who grew up on the more lyrical rap jay z nas biggie pac pun basically any big name in that mid to late era who know you can have both at a pretty high level are mainly just unimpressed with how simple the writing in popular rap songs has become before it used to look like these rappers were truly gifted writers and a lot of them still are but now that union between bars and vibes has separated and most dudes who do one cant or in yachtys case just doesnteffectively do the other now rap looks so easy and simple and thats what i think had a hand in spawning all these soundcloudinternet rappers creative pursuits imo thats one thing i will definitely praise drake for he is one of the few rappers this generation who ive seen can pretty much do any style of rap to a good degree hes done bangers to lyrical introspective rap his ampm series and of course his lovepop songs with rb and dancehall influences
hiphopheads,not_removed,your arguments pretty messy what does make an artist unique or special what determines whether an artist is unique to you is determined by the amount of artists youve heard do things that you would consider to be very similar what makes an artist special is completely up to you and a beat being accessible means almost nothing regarding the uniqueness of any artist im not sure why youd think it does and even the porn comparison doesnt work bc all porn is not made equal you wouldnt watch whatever and there are very likely some porn thatd youd like more than others and mumble rappers being used to satisfy a desire would put them in line with pretty much every other artist in the world we listen to be entertained impressed hyped up to feel sad strong or connected to any emotion or experience thats normal
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think in that comparison what makes the better rapper is entirely subjective to ones taste i think youll find plenty more arguing points for doom as the better rapper but that relies on a subjective definition of what makes someone a better rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres no issue with discussing the technical components subjectively i take issue with discussion on them objectively if were talking a live performance there should be much more room for objectivity than a studio album
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh you are right what i was said was a little too simplified biggie is a great example of someone that just had that talent to be able to literally do everything his music still holds up today i think the banger dumb simplification has a some merit but you still have songs like swimming pools and a lot of drakes music that just seems to do everything right the reason i used that simplification waa because i wasnt really talking to much about the music but more about the appropriateness of particular dumb songs and smart songs at parties or whatever seems like a decent topic to write a thesis on tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,well the word unique has an objective definition and in this context it usually means someone who doesnt sound the same as someone else so if i said i dont like that a lot of newer artists sound too similar to each other that is what i would mean isnt unique at all the reason i brought up the beat aspect is because that seems to be the only area imo that ever changes and even that deviation is being debated because lately the instrumentals being used arent even that unique the porn example isnt just that these rappers are satisfying just any desire its that the desire that their style of music is designed to fulfill doesnt need anyone unique to do it any one of us could do what these guys are doing and satisfy that desire the interchangeability of these artists imo is where the porn comparison comes in pornstars and their shelflives are about as long as i expect the careers of these artists to be i dont hate the new generation of rappers or anything and i dont have a problem with people who like listening to them my problem lies with how i am supposed to think theyre doing something unique or special when i see them the same way that i saw soulja boy when he came out every generation has these types of acts from the beginning of the genre until today but imo this generation seems to be the only who thinks their version of these artists are somehow going down in the history books as pioneers
hiphopheads,not_removed,understood i get that however there should be atleast slightly objective views on technically complex lyricism no you cant look at something like infrared in my pencil lead but always keep an extra one stocked though in the back pocket and both of em locked and theyre loaded like cocked twin glocks that im holdin you better pause when you see these two dots on your colon fuckin punks you wait just got to rockin and rollin cause elvis aint left the buildin yet im still a villain you feel a threat when i step in and kill a set in a millisec with the weapon of intellect hannibal lecter with the black belt vs i cant love no bitch every single ho is trife i sip dirty sprite just to get me through the night but i need you there promise that i need you there aint no other bitch gon fuck me like you do i swear put that on my gang i swear i just cant put you on front street like you want i know but baby you is not no ho and i put it on my gang im not no average joe its yachty from the block you know isnt there objectivity in which one is more technically proficient
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely there is a place and a mood when you want to listen to ignorant shit and just turn up and a time where you want to listen to some real shit i think the problem with todays rap is a lot of times the young fans and major influencers put more attention to the ignorant rap and any attempt of conscious or rap that makes you think about things is dismissed as critic bait as kanyetothe members regularly label to pimp a butterfly as i think today is a pretty nice balance you have future uzi thug yachty yg kodak etc and on the opposite end you have kendrick cole chance vince staples earl logic soulo etc who rap a little deeper than that i think the divide is kind of a reverse snobbiness from what older hip hop heads have in my interactions with the younger rap fans whereas hip hop heads may look down on rappers who arent saying enough content wise i feel like a lot of rap fans that are young inversely look down on any rap with a fraction of consciousness or deeper than surface level content at least when it comes to online discussion especially when the beat doesnt sound modern enough for them
hiphopheads,not_removed,unique has a definition its application is in fact subjective some people think all rap sounds the same and bc it all exists in the same genre all of it will in fact sound somewhat similar whether those similarities prevent them from being unique is entirely dependent on the listener and your conclusion about anyone being able to do what they do holds very little weight when their own fans dont even like of what they make and tens of thousands of artists would kill to have their success if anyone could do what they do we wouldnt know their names wed be focusing on the producers but thats simply not the case i think the idea that any one of us could do what uzi or yachty does is entirely based in musical ignorance everythings easier when someone else is doing it but i think if you actually tried to build a living off of sound flow cadence lyrics and melody youd find it a lot harder than you thought if uzi and yachty were interchangeable you wouldnt know theyre names i think you dont fully understand or appreciate what they do and that makes them interchangeable to you like nonhiphop listeners and all rappers they dont do what soulja boy does and the length of their careers is dependent upon many factors and choices porn stars also probably dont have short careers bc their interchangeable but more likely bc they didnt want to do it anymore and there are porn stars who do it for years
hiphopheads,not_removed,what are you using to measure technical proficency rhyme density and alliteration is that proficiency or density of lyrical techniques theyre not the same are they to say one is more proficient than the other is to suggest that one has greater technical skill than the other and in order for that to be true dont you have to assume that both are attempting to display their technical proficiency and expressing distaste for any bar youd consider a struggle bar is valid but that doesnt make it no longer a matter of taste
hiphopheads,not_removed,imo no we all hear things differently one person might not understand what doom is saying therefor they lean towards lil boat art is open to interpretation
hiphopheads,not_removed,being unique does not depend on the listener those who say all rap sounds the same havent listened to it ive listened to all these dudes projects and unique is the furthest word i would choose in regards to discussing them objectively they sound similar how you could argue otherwise is just an attempt again to find these dudes unique cause you like them its okay to like wack shit my g my conclusion isnt based in ignorance its based in the fact that i make music and the shit they do aint hard the reason why they popped off was timing they were the one sperm who broke through the fuckin egg with a million other dudes right next to them and behind them with the same sound they didnt do it first they just got lucky and broke through before anyone could quality control their music building a living off the shit aint got nothing to do with if its wack or not as a i said before people make a living off porn but that doesnt mean theyre considered good films theyre good for what they are which is in the moment short attention span rap they will not be relevant at all in years to come and yall will find some other wack ass artist to nut hug and pool your pitchfork parade of let me dictate the culture even though i aint from it behind them as ive said a thousand times on this subject its fine to like them do you i just have a distaste for acting like its gotta be pioneering in order to like it
hiphopheads,not_removed,rhyme density and alliteration yes also wordplay is that proficiency or density of lyrical techniques probably both no again this is just as interesting a topic for me i dont know the answers thats why im asking in order for that to be true dont you have to assume that both are attempting to display their technical proficiency yeah thats where it gets fuzzy good point i know em is on another level to yachty but i also know that that is an opinion so its this weird thing of there is objectively more wordplay and interesting grammatical techniques in ems bars but its not objectively better just objectively more dense how does that sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,one person might not understand what doom is saying therefor they lean towards lil boat thats fine but claiming that lil yachty is a more technically complex artist that comes off as ignorant since technical complexity comes from objective fields like grammatical techniques alliteration wordplay etc the denser the more complex
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmaooo dude who the fuck told you i like them did i say that i was real clear how unique the word should be applied is dependent on the listener howd you describe their music is in fact your opinion objectively all hiphop songs sound similar thats why they exist in a category called hiphop if i listen to yg and never listen to dre or snoop yg sounds a lot more unique and original subjectivity also you dont know what objective means and i left this out when you first made that terrible comparison to porn but porn does not have the same intention as non pornographic movies so we do not judge them by the same standard what makes a porn good to you may not be what makes a movie good to you do you watch any and all porn all of it good to you any and everything gets the job done no probably not right so all porn is not made equal meaning some might be considered better than others and you keep saying that they wont last but thats not even a real criticism lmao most people dont even get to where they are now to say they wont last is just you hating that they got there in the first place you have zero proof that they only got popular bc of timing lmao and objective kind of require facts sothats a nice opinion i guess and if people only care about the beats why wouldnt people follow the producer and not the artists lol what actual argument do you have and plz dont insinuate i fuck with pitchfork
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would say both yachty and em would agree that theres objectively more density of lyrical techniques but interesting is inherently subjective

hiphopheads,not_removed,troymetheus average is trash hes just diet cent im not even a pro era fan but hes a fuckin dickhead for dissing steez after he died
hiphopheads,not_removed,well first off he shot some people in a club and dodged the murder charges when theres a video of him doing it he bites styles and is overly arrogant about it he also has talked about kanye and kendrick being bad artists which obviously didnt sit well with a lot of people he dissed steez he also does a lot of stupid stuff on twitter quite frequently heres an pretty old tho im sure hes done some more shit but thats all i can think of atm just overall an idiot tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,beef with someone who hhh adores but i forget who troy ave said some unnecessary shit iirc
hiphopheads,not_removed,something i want to know also
hiphopheads,not_removed,hhh hates him because he dissed steez i personally think anything goes in a rap beef i dont really care for troy as a rapper though
hiphopheads,not_removed,what do you think of mobb deep or biggie
hiphopheads,not_removed,u should give him a chance hes actually dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,where did he say kendrick and kayne were bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,the steez diss was good whether you like him or not
hiphopheads,not_removed,capital steez
hiphopheads,not_removed,he dissed steez hard after he killed himself
hiphopheads,not_removed,he spit a beef rhyme about capital steez making fun of his suicide thats my dislike of him
hiphopheads,not_removed,he did put together the diss well and the song was a good diss but he just took it over the line he went from a rap beef to mocking the suicide and tragic death of joeys childhood friend to get to him
hiphopheads,not_removed,whys that bad anything goes in beef
hiphopheads,not_removed,wheres the line in beef
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just told you
hiphopheads,not_removed,we some southern ogs trill recognize trill man this song is so dope id love to see another bun solo album
hiphopheads,not_removed,no artist has obsessed over drake this much since tory lanez
hiphopheads,not_removed,fucking hell that is both the funniest and most petty shit ive seen in rap in a minute 😂
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao bro this is the best shit ive seen this beef is going to get interesting
hiphopheads,not_removed,this dude is literally obsessed with drake i mean does anyone else notice this like thats all this dude can talk about or reference since hes been out of jail i dont know hardcore drake stans that talk about drake as much as this dude fr look at this dudes twitter its all drake lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,really doing the most for half a line in the next drake song
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats fucking hilariously petty lmao im dead
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe budden
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake really got all this dudes feeling a type a way over the dumbest shit lmao budden got mad because drake didnt make the album he wanted him to make he made a bunch of songs taking shots than no one talks about or cares about and now x is trying to use drakes name to prop himself into discussion its petty lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit had me dying i hope drake does something would be most entertaining shit in a while
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake has to have some connections
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes fresh out of jail and has a buzz that comes once in a lifetime this is probably the easiest way to keep stoking the fire albeit the least elegant
hiphopheads,not_removed,rap game danielle bregoli
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you listen to his first recordings sizzle has improved a lot as a rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,terrible
hiphopheads,not_removed,grab the nearest rope and chair and kys
hiphopheads,not_removed,very interesting mesh of genres and sounds songs ranging from travis scottesque to a more grimy paramore love it ive been wondering how someone could take that lil uzi vert raprock sound and make it even more rock guess this guy got it
hiphopheads,not_removed,album is short but concise and to the point he uses the autotune distortion combo to his advantage and the vibe is pretty dirty but still super nice i definitely recommend this
hiphopheads,not_removed,so unconventional i love it it mixes pop punk rock and rap and it actually sounds really damn good drugs is a catchy ass song
hiphopheads,not_removed,fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,thought this wasnt gonna get posted this album and this dude are gonna be huge
hiphopheads,not_removed,drugs has been stuck in my head all day
hiphopheads,not_removed,yikes title and cover are corny as fuck lmao music isnt bad tho definitely worth a listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil aaron is the future
hiphopheads,not_removed,bucks
hiphopheads,not_removed,good charlotte meets travis scott
hiphopheads,not_removed,no 👏 haters 👏 only 👏 sweeties 👏
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol this is the mexico link its actually usd
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats actually a really good comparison lol the song drugs is straight outta
hiphopheads,not_removed,the thirteenth song sacrifices ft migos is positively guaranteed to be a monster hit i wrote that assumption down immediately as soon as i heard its explosive drums and the intensity in big seans voice but once offset came in first teasing fans with his famous adlib then delivering a quintessentially charismatic verse before inevitably passing the microphone to his bandmate quavo the radio potential for this deep cut multiplied immensely cant wait to hear this song
hiphopheads,not_removed,no favors which features detroitnative and rap legend eminem turned the room up to another level and even inspired someone in the crowd to yell out twice the whole city been waiting on that everyone whos heard ems verse so far has been saying things similar to this so im hoping its really the type of verse that makes you actually want to yell something like that after listening one of those oh shit did that just happen moments on an album em is still the goat to me so i have no doubt hell deliver
hiphopheads,not_removed,man i cant wait for this shit side note how cool of a job is a music journalist
hiphopheads,not_removed,can you give more details on the eminem verse
hiphopheads,not_removed,super pumped to hear this sounds like a dope album and hopefully itll flip some big sean haters here
hiphopheads,not_removed,how did you get in touch with big seans camp to get an invite as a mass comm majorhhh this would be a dream come true lol were in the same year of college so i know its weird asking for advice but did you personally reach out to them or how did the whole thing happen
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh my gosh this writeup is incredible i genuinely havent felt excitement for a project from reading an article like this in a long time amazing work i cant wait for the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,nice to hear about stuff like this happening in michigan cheers on the article
hiphopheads,not_removed,never thought id see the michigan daily on hhh lol so hyped for this album though
hiphopheads,not_removed,hyped for this
hiphopheads,not_removed,super excited for this album even more so after reading this
hiphopheads,not_removed,go blue
hiphopheads,not_removed,very interesting im loving the more explanation of the theme of the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,nice writeup do you remember by any chance whether jeremih has his own verse or just a hookoutro type of feature on the second song light
hiphopheads,not_removed,the quote about no favors gives me hope that em is back on his real goat flow now i cant fucking wait for the
hiphopheads,not_removed,sounds promising we just need to wait till friday
hiphopheads,not_removed,actually really looking forward to big seans new album hes one of the artists whose discography i can look at and say look at his progression this and more life are gonna make it a great february
hiphopheads,not_removed,every single hes put out for his album has been great i hope the rest are just as good
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn invite me to come next time
hiphopheads,not_removed,yoo thats awesome does that mean takeoffs not on it tho lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,god damn does that mean its not that annoying super fast pissed off chopped flow now i am hyped
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wonder if he has another comeback in him it was his verses on airplanes and forever that convinced people he still had it after relapse was poorly received
hiphopheads,not_removed,think this is a snippet of the song no em though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was gonna study journalism in college because i basically spend all my time writing about and listening to music but my family and i decided that i should pick a normal career thats a little more reliable with a steady paycheck and all that stuff still havent decided on something though because its a hard decision i dont think i would have been great at music journalism anyways because im extremely shy and apparently you have to be outgoing and social in this field
hiphopheads,not_removed,just a few days till you hear it man
hiphopheads,not_removed,his last album was wack apart from the singles like i fucked with it for a while but we both know it was hella mediocre he needs to step up and stop trying to sing so god damn much
hiphopheads,not_removed,he got credentialed through his student newspaper
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely because of the u michigan connection sounds like sean really repping his city on this one
hiphopheads,not_removed,why does takeoff always seem like the shy guy that everyone leaves out in the group
hiphopheads,not_removed,are any of us really surprised at this point
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean i think it probably will be but one of his better ones
hiphopheads,not_removed,ah shit man i hadnt clocked that you wrote it thats so cool im about to start studying english lit and plan to do a post grad course in journalism and musicsports would be amazing keep doing your thing bro getting opportunities like this means youre doing something right shoot me a pm with any advice you have if you have time
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey man i really enjoyed your article i myself am a college student trying to pursue a career in journalism and while i have a minor in politics and would be perfectly happy covering current events i would equally if not more love to pursue my lifelong love of music and write about that how do you deal with the constant claims that arts journalism is dead what steps have you taken to establish yourself in the music industry
hiphopheads,not_removed,are you involved with music matters
hiphopheads,not_removed,life aint long enough to do what your parents tell you in terms of your career be happy and chase your dream bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,browsing rleakthreads like a fiend
hiphopheads,not_removed,its upsetting my school newspaper shut down a couple years ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes not quiet because hes shy in interviews hes baked out of his mind and cant remember what he wants to say
hiphopheads,not_removed,takeoff had one of the best verse flows on the whole album with his get right witcha verse
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes takeoff had a huge presence all over culture although he does far less features than offset and quavo but migos work hes on everything just like the other two
hiphopheads,not_removed,if its as good as medecin man or det vs erybody i can take itbut i am really hoping its a different flow lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,easy to say til you realize who is footing most or all the bill for college lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not even good advice you can get a degree in something that will be able to get a decent paycheck and still follow your dreams two of my close friends graduated with a degree in journalism and get paid less than a year
hiphopheads,not_removed,sad media is a weird place to be in right now
hiphopheads,not_removed,takeoff really shined on culture i hope more people start to give him credit
hiphopheads,not_removed,and deadz
hiphopheads,not_removed,loved his verse on slippery
hiphopheads,not_removed,out yo way verse was flames as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,takeoff is almost never in anything ft migos
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think hes saying that takeoff should have been left off but that hes always left out while offset and quavo get featured on a lot of songs thats why were not surprised but it sucks because takeoff is so underrated
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk what interview it was but sean said that its a new sound and flow hopefully em uses it in his new album if thats true
hiphopheads,not_removed,if your parents are going to pay for your college but use it to force you into something you will be miserable doing for the rest of your life take out loans
hiphopheads,not_removed,the one reason im glad im footing all of my college bills lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant read sad without donald trumps voice anymore motherfucker
hiphopheads,not_removed,give him credit for not participating in his groups features
hiphopheads,not_removed,whoa did this song go hard my fave on the whole project actually
hiphopheads,not_removed,tru dat also i felt like his verse on tshirt should have been the closing verse it was so fucking good
hiphopheads,not_removed,agreed love those first couple of lines
hiphopheads,not_removed,im hoping its reminiscent of his infinite flow especially after hearing the remastered version of the title track need some new em
hiphopheads,not_removed,or get a degree in english or history while also getting internships for journalism or starting a blog on your own so you have a degree to fall back on while the writing an researching skills you learn from your degree will help with your writing
hiphopheads,not_removed,come on now its definitely not like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,he needs to age back into infinite songs like dont front and ground hog day are easily his most pleasing songs post recovery his other flow is a trip if you like the technical aspect of rap but it doesnt suit well for casual listening
hiphopheads,not_removed,strong agree
hiphopheads,not_removed,this was not the only tupac item sold there was also these items
hiphopheads,not_removed,jesus pac my man that letter is hilarious
hiphopheads,not_removed,this vid is dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,loving this new sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,by the game
hiphopheads,not_removed,skyfall travi and thugga prod by metro travi and mike dean the fallthe weeknd produced by clams casino pyramidsfrank ocean produced by frank malay and ommas keith
hiphopheads,not_removed,the beats are overall ok fluorescent is the best one your rap is ok too i think youve found your cadence but you need a little more processingeffects to make your voice stand out on the tracks your singing is a whole other story though dont like it this is probably one of the better original content postings on here so good on you keep it up
hiphopheads,not_removed,i said this when the article came out way back when but i will forever be grateful this album came out for how it eventually spawned the weeknd
hiphopheads,not_removed,im sure that pitchfork really regrets giving a very modest score compared to the rest of his discography at the time but then again almost every music critic hated the album when it was releasedand the public reaction was mostly mixed
hiphopheads,not_removed,these are facts charlie heat version
hiphopheads,not_removed,someone should do an article on cudis influence on
hiphopheads,not_removed,great read ive been heavily listening to recently dealing with my own heartbreak and the sound of the album hits that i need sad music nerve perfectly you listen and can just hear and feel the emotion put into the music
hiphopheads,not_removed,not my favourite kanye album but i still mantain this as the most influential hip hop album of the last years
hiphopheads,not_removed,this album is in my top albums of all time i genuinely believe this album is simply one of the best albums put out in the last years
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just started listening to kanye this year which im super mad about and the two albums that stood out to me the most are this and mbdtf i love the tracks from his older albums but as whole albums i like these the most because they feel so coherent when i listen to its like listening to the greatest musical experiment ever conceived it sounds like the future not the rapper more so than future the rapper ever will i think that what makes this album so great and what kanye got so perfectly right on here is the way he uses pauses ive never understood the importance of a pause in music until i listened to heartbreak on heartless there are none it starts off right from the start and ends with him mumbling something welcome to heartbreak the track right before it is filled with long pauses just right to think about what the line just meant kanye often lures the listener into thinking what is he going at then revealing what the line before meant his usage of pauses is something ive never seen in any musician before welcome to heartbreak is filled with this its one of my favorite tracks from kanye every verse starts off with something great the kids of his friend a dad cracking a joke his godsister getting married but is twisted into an equivalently sad or painful emotion you got a new friend well i got homies but at the end its still so lonely such a powerful way to end a verse from heartless
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly is my favorite kanye album it also has my favorite kanye song on it with street lights he shaped the new school with this album also respect to cudi for his contributions
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like that history is being kind to this album it deserves it its like the majority of the hip hop that has come out in the last couple years has roots in drake future keef thugger travis whatever theyre basically kanyes sons
hiphopheads,not_removed,my favourite kanye album i dont think i know anyone else whos favourite is
hiphopheads,not_removed,this album is just a fine wine that gets better and better as people recognize its influence
hiphopheads,not_removed,was the album that got me over a pretty terrible period in my life ill forever appreciate this album and kanye for that
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope the influence of this album lasts a long time i wonder what comes next
hiphopheads,not_removed,important music is not necessarily terrific music i like and its influence today is super apparent but i really think hes made much better records
hiphopheads,not_removed,am i the only one who hates this album
hiphopheads,not_removed,is one the most important hiphoprb albums ever its very rare to see a single album permanently change the game like this one did
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake said it influenced him hugely too and i think sonically its very unique and makes an impact
hiphopheads,not_removed,kanyes pinkerton in a way i think importance cannot be overstated when the article came out it did a good job of noting that importance but not going so overboard with it id like to think that the people who had mixed feelings about saw it from a new perspective rather than writing off this article to fanatisicism
hiphopheads,not_removed,having a big influence shouldnt warrant a higher score when rating the music itself
hiphopheads,not_removed,to be honest i agree with all the influence the album is credited with but i still dont think its a super great album there are a good few weak songs the core ideas and sound is what made the influence though not the strength of the record so i still think it adds up as valid
hiphopheads,not_removed,they ended up putting at on their year end list so its not like it was panned
hiphopheads,not_removed,couches couches couches couches
hiphopheads,not_removed,im glad im not the only one who does that after saying facts
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt know that was even a topic can you do an
hiphopheads,not_removed,on the other hand i find sometimes its not sad enough because the beats are just so dope lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,november rain is a great sad song for that kind of stuff its also a great song period
hiphopheads,not_removed,is it a hiphop album
hiphopheads,not_removed,it sounds like the future not the rapper more so than future the rapper ever will wtf does this even mean
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeezus tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,same i started back in december with mbdtf and those two stood out compared to the rest and basically made me a kanye fan
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wonder how much james blake is inspired by in this respect hes certainly very big on using pauses in his music in a similar way
hiphopheads,not_removed,silence can be a very powerful tool in music one of my favorite examples of a pause that adds to the song is in by stevie wonder the whole song is breathtaking but theres this part about ten seconds after right where everything stops for a second right before he starts the last verse and it just gives me goosebumps every time you can hear his chair squeaking and shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,i never noticed that about heartless the intake of breath really is apparent and an important piece of the song
hiphopheads,not_removed,when i listen to its like the greatest musical experiment ever conceived hold up what i have to assume your musical cognizance is a bit limited after a statement like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,no respect to t pain who had an even larger influence
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like future and thugger were a lot more influenced by lil wayne than
hiphopheads,not_removed,how in the fuck is chief keef a son of wtf they couldnt be more apart or different
hiphopheads,not_removed,future and chief keef what not every autotuned artist is an spin off
hiphopheads,not_removed,its also my favorite a lot of people say its their second favorite after mbdtf
hiphopheads,not_removed,easily for me i think pinocchio story is the only song i dont completely fuck with
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk if id put it no second thought but its always in my top
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have a hard time picking a favourite album but is for sure the one i go back to the most and when i do i pretty much always listen right through
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah im with ya is easily his best the run from love lockdown to bad news is just insane all like top ye tracks for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,man thats what really gets me about people who write kanye off as a notalent egomaniac as ive heard someone put it like kanye isnt my favorite rapper and he can be an asshole sometimes but to deny the influence of this album is just ignorant
hiphopheads,not_removed,influence of yeezus
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes you are the only person in the world who has come forward with this opinion so far
hiphopheads,not_removed,did you read the article
hiphopheads,not_removed,imo yeezus is his pinkerton both were an abrasive break from a critically acclaimed album that preceded it and both cuomo and kanye pump up the personas they portray on the records to near caricature levels only major difference is that cuomo channels this towards sadness similar to and kanye towards anger
hiphopheads,not_removed,is what made me fall in love with hip hop i knew a couple of rap songs before it and i listened to eminem like every other white kid but i didnt really enjoy anything outside of that but then i caught kanye performing love lockdown on snl i remember being kind of blown away by it because the sound was so new to me immediately downloaded the album at the time i didnt get why it was looked down on but i went back and listened to it again recently and realized like shit if i was a kanye fan and id spent all these years listening to his chopped soul beats and shit then i get all hyped up for his new album and cop it and hear say you will id be confused as hell too
hiphopheads,not_removed,the dude kinge from dehh really hates
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats pinkerton
hiphopheads,not_removed,plus they put it at at the end of the year so its not like they panned it
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive literally had my keyboard autocorrect the word facts charlie heat version to automatically add charlie heat version
hiphopheads,not_removed,kid cudi had a huge influence on kanye and wrote on a good portion of
hiphopheads,not_removed,its like conflicting emotions you want to be sad because of the music but the beats make you feel good and you just flow with it
hiphopheads,not_removed,november rain always gives me chills especially when that solo comes on towards the end
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a gospel album
hiphopheads,not_removed,kanye west called it pop art or pop
hiphopheads,not_removed,also true but i dont really like that album all the way through
hiphopheads,not_removed,anyone have suggestions for music similar to yeezus minimal production aggressive lyrics etc i know a lot of people mention clipping and death grips and i love those groups but i dont think theyre similar enough to yeezus to satisfy that itch government plates is the only project from either of those two that id consider similar to yeezus edit shit nldw is close to yeezus as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,whatever i just love it maybe i went a bit over the top im not actually a native speaker not the greatest but really good thats what i tried to say with like the greatest
hiphopheads,not_removed,the only similarities between and what tpain was doing is autotune
hiphopheads,not_removed,not larger but to be fair there was another article that said west enlisted the help of tpain to learn how to really take advantage of autotune
hiphopheads,not_removed,in terms of flows yeah in terms of overall sound i disagree
hiphopheads,not_removed,thug yes but i definitely feel the influence in some of futures music like monster and purple reign tapes especially
hiphopheads,not_removed,they literally talk about this in the article keef uses the vocal effect that makes it sound like hes drowning in his own voice a lot before nobody really took autotune seriously since it was seen as a fad driven into the ground by tpain but kanye brought it to the hiphop mainstream in an innovative way the article cites the weeknd calling it one of the most important albums of his generation lil uzi vert once said in an interview that it changed his life drake remixed say you will on so far gone an so on so i dont think its a stretch to say keef who was when came out was strongly influenced by it
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to nobody keef has also worked a lot with kanye there is no denying that he was greatly influenced
hiphopheads,not_removed,learn to listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,especially considering a ton of autotuned stuff came out before that
hiphopheads,not_removed,im always debating with myself for that mbdtf is a masterpiece but when i listen to is another thing the emotion the beats his autotune both albums are the top of ye
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive noticed that lot of people unjustly write off kanye the musician because of kanye the person andor his more obsessive fans
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would never say no to more travis but are you sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeezus brought a minimalistgrimey feel to the rap game you can ever hear it in guccis new album yeezus changed everything
hiphopheads,not_removed,also yeezus was critically acclaimed
hiphopheads,not_removed,its mykes favorite from kanye though
hiphopheads,not_removed,he also remarked how it would bring more artists to try it
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a weezer album the whole thing was really emotional and emotional and was panned by critics weezer fans absolutely love it though and regard it as their best their previous album had been more fun and people were disappointed that pinkerton hadnt been more of the same
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is genius
hiphopheads,not_removed,wrote a good portion source
hiphopheads,not_removed,interesting to learn im gonna go find more about that
hiphopheads,not_removed,seriously its electronic pop theres barely any rapping and the only really connection is the machine it doesnt sound remotely like hiphop
hiphopheads,not_removed,wut its electropopsynthpop wheres the fuckin gospel lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea lol he said the only other music that matches its genre is pink floyd
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought it was whack at first you gotta get used to it
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeezus was an album i deemed garbage until i was exposed at least times then i started going i love that part where it goes du nu nu na and just wait for the da da na dann kinda silly how i like the album but its definitely one of my favorites now
hiphopheads,not_removed,chief keef used that vocal effect because he was sipping way to much lean at the time just like lil wayne was doing around this time in youre forgetting that tha carter and dedication albums that were way more popular in the streets than and heartbreaks came out also in so i dont think and heartbreak influenced chief keef that much
hiphopheads,not_removed,kerr
hiphopheads,not_removed,kanye wasnt first to use drums
hiphopheads,not_removed,those people are the same it isnt real music people ive met guys who tried to say that eminem developed and influenced the genre more than kanye no hate to em i fuck with his early work and i met a guy who thought his pro black message and lyricism was hot garbage despite liking i wanna be black by lou reed which is a load of unrepentant shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,ironically a lot of these older people probably also listen to michael jackson but nah kanyes music must be terrible because of who he is as a person
hiphopheads,not_removed,we cant keep saying every kanye album changed everything
hiphopheads,not_removed,he cites it as one of the most influential albums for him and thinks it had a hugely underrated cultural impact
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow damn strong hate just for not knowing a weezer album are those dudes even still popular
hiphopheads,not_removed,the thing is that kanye was a rapper and people associate him with that genre onlyeven though a lot of his music is a mixture of different genres makes me sound like ye dick rider but thats what makes him great
hiphopheads,not_removed,right but given kanyes place within hiphop at the time it was bound to draw in or influence a lot of hiphop artists and listeners regardless of whether or not its actually a hiphop album
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol i was referring to that tweet ye made
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was a joke before tlop came out kanye tweeted that it would be a gospel album
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i had the same experience with kendrick and tpab ill probably try listening to it again
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really like on sight black skinhead new slaves and blood on the leaves but some songs just fall short its very up and down for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you
hiphopheads,not_removed,plenty of esteemed musicians are assholes in some way or another its just another excuse to dismiss an artist they dont like
hiphopheads,not_removed,although we can day its disappointing that yeezus didnt have that big an influence
hiphopheads,not_removed,almost every kanye album changes everything look at tlop shit influenced a lot
hiphopheads,not_removed,how was he hating you must admit that its pretty odd asking a question like that instead of googling it what does their current relevance have to do with their legacy pinkerton is one of the most praised albums of all time whether theyre popular now doesnt matter
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you can use reddit im sure you can google it if you looked it up and said whats the significancecomparison then it would probably wouldve gotten a different reaction
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh sorry man
hiphopheads,not_removed,its too new to say that yet i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,such as
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty self explanatory tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,i could have just googled pinkerton but i wasnt sure what i was looking for the first result on google is a detective agency google it is the classic response to give when you think someone asked a dumb question and i was getting some dv so sorry for feelin a lil salty ive never heard of the album and its weird to use it as a reference in a hiphop sub especially when its not like really well known im sure its well known in the rockalt community but not nationally
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wasnt interested in the significancecomparison i was wondering what it was
hiphopheads,not_removed,its okay i dont expect everyone to be ye twitter god
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok ive gone back to it and its actually really good holy shit i still realise its not the album to show anyone as a way to get into kanye west cause its really extreme like i feel thats the best way to describe the tracks on this album everythings so over the top its not really something to listen to casually but thats sort of special in its own right
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk im still developing my opinion of the album since i slept on ye and started listening to him in like march
hiphopheads,not_removed,chance the rapper james blake schoolboy q drake desiigner
hiphopheads,not_removed,gotcha yeah i think they still dont perform pinkerton songs to this day because rivers hated the reaction it got so much
hiphopheads,not_removed,then fucking google it you goof
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok you have to explain this one
hiphopheads,not_removed,nope saw em live recently and they performed songs from pinkerton why bother el scrotcho good life tired of sex and no other one as well as their whole white album and a majority of their blue album think rivers cumo got over hatin pinkerton
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah fuck me for going for the easier route of just asking someone on a site im already on instead of wasting entire seconds typing some dumb shit i didnt even end up caring about into google why dont you climb outta my ass buddy
hiphopheads,not_removed,true but this sub and other stuff has made me appreciate some things i would have never imagined liking most recently rodeo
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh good
hiphopheads,not_removed,spends hours on reddit cant google the question you asked on reddit waiting two hours for a response mmmmmmm
hiphopheads,not_removed,man its just easier
hiphopheads,not_removed,dudes gotta work on his facial expressions
hiphopheads,not_removed,he looks like hes thinking how nice kendricks skin would be as a lampshade
hiphopheads,not_removed,ill take kendrick x hhh collab for alex
hiphopheads,not_removed,move to creative sxn

hiphopheads,not_removed,i was pleasantly surprised by how yachty handled himself pretty major w as far as his image goes
hiphopheads,not_removed,why would you respect soulja boy
hiphopheads,not_removed,with thousands of dollars worth of drugs blaming them for your problems its the lack of them thats giving him problems though
hiphopheads,not_removed,india bad as fuck far from basic

hiphopheads,not_removed,his snapchats of him doing the crank dat dance had me dying
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe kiss me thru the phone changed his life
hiphopheads,not_removed,because he started from the bottom and really is self made artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,u should read the comment about him on a bpt post
hiphopheads,not_removed,because he basically spawned all of the new wave rappers by making the internet a hub for musicians
hiphopheads,not_removed,believe me i follow her on snapchat and she is basic as hell if its not a selfie of her looking fine its bible verses for people who cant read the bible or some stupid shit plenty of other instathots to beef over if these guys really want to start shit over dumbass hoes plus shes already fucked game and god knows who else

hiphopheads,not_removed,act goin out here for like a pint who tf gon spend that much on codeine may as well go pic up some damn hydros or even fuckin h if you need your opiate fix that bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,codeine by itself def isnt anything to write home about but prometh w codeine does something different man i have done most of popular opiates even the hard onesand save for intravenous morphine lean is place it has to metabolize differently or something it has a more euphoric feel also easier to control ie stop sipping when you get too high
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre an idiot if you buy lean if youre gonna be an opiate addict do it right and stick to oxy opana and heroin lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have a video on my phone if you have a way for me to share it
hiphopheads,not_removed,

hiphopheads,not_removed,dude just put it in your my eyes only
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean she would have be able to prove thats her in court and since theres no face if she doesnt still have the original image i dont see how she could possibly prove its her
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not a fan of plastic surgery at all but to say those dont look nice boy youre lying to yourself
hiphopheads,not_removed,these gay boys out here worried about whats inside em those are some nice ass titties
hiphopheads,not_removed,just go drink some water son have a night in

hiphopheads,not_removed,yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,this thread has some of the realest posts ive ever seen on this sub
hiphopheads,not_removed,rumor has it he created the internet
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea but soulja was one of the first internet rappers to go mainstream a lot of cats from little brother to the cool kids kid cudi action bronson charles hamilton etc got their start back in the myspace era but soulja was one of the first to break through to the radio he also did it independently
hiphopheads,not_removed,blessed
hiphopheads,not_removed,she doesnt fuck up the game the game fucks her
hiphopheads,not_removed,age difference on kylie tyga level
hiphopheads,not_removed,preach

hiphopheads,not_removed,wtf you mean they are fake i just saw a picture of them
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty good probably
hiphopheads,not_removed,its conflicting on one hand theyre nice titties on the other i think i wouldve rather had her send me the pics then seeing random rappers post her shit up lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly how you expect she fucked with the football players athletes etc i was a nerd and didnt really think too much of her beyond damn she fine and half ass attempts to get to know her what really made me more aware of her presence was when we found out she was fucking with the gameat she was also talked about for having a stupid amount of insta followers
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like proving its her wouldnt be hard she could retake the picture in the same spot or probably still have the thread of her sending it to him in her phone he also admits its her on the tweet so theirs that but thats besides the point im almost positive that whole tweet picture is photoshopped cant find a single reputable site reporting it happened
hiphopheads,not_removed,hydrated boyz out here
hiphopheads,not_removed,mick so proud
hiphopheads,not_removed,all about the flex aint no reason to pay that much just because act got notoriety behind it
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a drink if you know what sodas to use it tastes great and niggas too lazy to cold water extract their hydros
hiphopheads,not_removed,might be the ability to drink it or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,codeine got popular back in the day before it was prescription only it was one of the better highs you could get without a scrip but once you started needing one it kinda lost the whole point with the current day price and how hard it is to find its pretty dumb to still do in
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think a lot of it depends where you are philly street rappers are all about perc and compared to lean
hiphopheads,not_removed,drugs become popular in rap cause of their asthetic a double cup is more visible than pills
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes not wrong tho compared to other opiates lean is literally a waste of money
hiphopheads,not_removed,good life choice trust me
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats wrong with heroin
hiphopheads,not_removed,viperboyz we out here
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like lil uzi but im not gonna let a motherfucker named uliluzivertyachty hand out a single l to me your life is an l pleighboi

hiphopheads,not_removed,al soulja boy gore
hiphopheads,not_removed,ps i love my son
hiphopheads,not_removed,i totally agree but its also a really good example of travis scott saying shit that makes zero sense but still sounds good not hating im typing this while wearing a rodeo hat
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats actually the one song i dont like aha
hiphopheads,not_removed,ganstalicious my minds too vicious eat mcs all day mmm delicious
hiphopheads,not_removed,and this wasnt even rap lyrics it was him waving a gun around and threatening to kill someone on video
hiphopheads,not_removed,lml shit now we know the kinds of people on this sub how are these guys going to argue saying they are real when clearly they never saw a pair in their life they are obviously fake however they where very well done
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn thats crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,drink more water
hiphopheads,not_removed,stay hydrated
hiphopheads,not_removed,i guess that makes sense someone should start selling hydro beverages
hiphopheads,not_removed,eh it aint bad in canada go into the doctor and tell them you got a bad cough tried some codeine syrup of your grandpas that worked real well after that you get the prescription filled for under and youre good to go for a bit
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes extorting you
hiphopheads,not_removed,come back to me after it inevitably kills one of your friends

hiphopheads,not_removed,lol you do know the guys joking right
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn this guys seen tits in real life
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to mick jenkins yall
hiphopheads,not_removed,or else you might die
hiphopheads,not_removed,hydrocodone syrup is sold its yellow i believe thats what the doctor prescribed me for bronchitis hydrocodone syrup
hiphopheads,not_removed,lots of things can kill you
hiphopheads,not_removed,crazy that that verse was a reference for rihanna
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was mainly going at the guy that wrote puberty bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,mike water drank it
hiphopheads,not_removed,what about makonnen tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,i pour up yellow tuss i pour up yellow tuss
hiphopheads,not_removed,that tuss
hiphopheads,not_removed,puberty bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,two different peoples thats gotta be her big sister south asia
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk man seems like youre presuming a lot maybe theyre just swollen
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn this is like finding out santa isnt real
hiphopheads,not_removed,ahh fairs i thought you were reply ing to the guy saying he saw them so they aint fake haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah that was a joke too buddy
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to them both at the same time
hiphopheads,not_removed,surgery bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,man everything bino does is just the most gambino thing ever like its really fucking cool but at the same time its like wtf
hiphopheads,not_removed,sorry bino just spent all my vinyl money on blond
hiphopheads,not_removed,what does virtual reality vinyl mean though
hiphopheads,not_removed,so apparently a store in indy accidentally started selling the bino cd and this guy is live streaming it on periscope rn he cant upload because he doesnt have a cd drive on his laptop lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,im so conflicted on copping this because i have no idea what the vr will entail and without knowing i cant justify shipping the app had a phone vr music video which was just footage from the pharos concert and it gave me a headache so i would be bummed if it was a bunch of that shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,guess ill be waiting til to cop the vinyl lp
hiphopheads,not_removed,bino must be living in a virtual reality if he thinks plus shipping is a reasonable price for an lp
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo i cant support for vinyl
hiphopheads,not_removed,those shipping charges to the uk though fml
hiphopheads,not_removed,shipped in cad for the vinyl you gotta be kiddin me bino wish i could justify it but that isnt happening
hiphopheads,not_removed,stunt on these hoes wont appear in hhh
hiphopheads,not_removed,there has to be a different conver man no way im buying that on vinyl i like to adorn my room with vinyls but i aint trying to wake up to that face in the mornings i wish a deluxe version existed looks like im coping the digital version
hiphopheads,not_removed,do you guys know the the physical cd comes with a digital download as well considering my options here
hiphopheads,not_removed,i want the album and poster but
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude someone is live streaming his whole album on periscope
hiphopheads,not_removed,expecting me to buy the limited edition vinyl with no explanation of what on earth the gimmick is strikes me as an awful move id buy an lp but ill probably buy standard and even still only if the pricing is fair
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn was planning on preordering that vinyl for weeks now but that price tag i guess ill wait till theres a standard lp release
hiphopheads,not_removed,its probably better to buy directly from his site if i wanna support him right
hiphopheads,not_removed,what did he mean by this
hiphopheads,not_removed,ill wait for a standard lp ya boi aint made of money hopefully listening on apple music is support enough for now i did buy all of atlanta on itunes
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wonder if hes gonna have dlc because that would fit perfectly with his demographic
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes kind of like the rap game flaming lips with his promotional stuff except less embryos
hiphopheads,not_removed,i got both im eating ramen for like a week
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow i just realized that frank ocean store had a timer i shouldnt have fucking waited dammit
hiphopheads,not_removed,bino is kinda a dorkier version of frank not necessarily music wise
hiphopheads,not_removed,how much did it cost
hiphopheads,not_removed,i got both im eating ramen for like a week
hiphopheads,not_removed,he hasnt actually said what it entails but i imagine itll likely be something like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would laugh my ass off if its a vive game with a record player and a pharos vinyl
hiphopheads,not_removed,wondering the exact same thing i know in one article i read recently they said that his pharos concerts were taped with vr cameras so it might have something to do with that but theres no information on it whatsoever besides virtual reality being in the title on the shop hmmmmm
hiphopheads,not_removed,im pretty sure itll just be a record with a hologram on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe it comes with a vr recording of one of his shows or music videos for a vr headset
hiphopheads,not_removed,someone in the comments on periscope said someone on reddit would probably drive to your house with a cd drive haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao love it should be out sooner than later
hiphopheads,not_removed,im liking california and zombies
hiphopheads,not_removed,i randomly saw it in an electronic store today in nl was so hesitant to buy it
hiphopheads,not_removed,no shit know what store i dont imagine theyre still selling it but ill find out
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really hate these shipping charges on any of the items in the store its like or something for the poster and the download of the album but shipping is almost for me i know ill end up doing it but that shipping cost is dumb
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i can see this being mass produced and much cheaper but i still want it lol im an idiot and payed for for the bti bootleg and still bought the record store day version
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah im sure bino himself sat down and worked out all the prices
hiphopheads,not_removed,depending on the weight of the vinyl packaging press quality and whatever extras are included some virtual reality element its not crazy if i remember right because the internet was about and the cover was holographic and it included a screenplay hard copy plus two disc new lps typically run with just sleeves and no extras in my experience source work in a record shop
hiphopheads,not_removed,im pretty sure it comes with the poster too and posters are usually at least on their own
hiphopheads,not_removed,i once dropped for a batman tas soundtrack on vinyl i have some regrets
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think the most ive spent on a record is and even then i had my doubts but it was such a good album that i had to get it
hiphopheads,not_removed,with shipping its american which for me is over canadian wtf
hiphopheads,not_removed,its shipping to australia just for the album poster not even counting usdaud rate think im gonna sit this one out
hiphopheads,not_removed,check some uk distro sites maybe banquet will sell some
hiphopheads,not_removed,its nuts just for the shipping on the vinyl
hiphopheads,not_removed,its one or the other just look on the website
hiphopheads,not_removed,i bought it from his site to support him but you can get just the cd on amazon for like
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea i was thinking the exact same thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,is it fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,likely
hiphopheads,not_removed,this comment just made my evening
hiphopheads,not_removed,man with the right ingredients that aint exactly a bad thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,im crazy jealous
hiphopheads,not_removed,i got both and atcq im not eating for like a week
hiphopheads,not_removed,but also why cant these artists just make their music easily accessible some people couldnt afford blonde at that moment and now were screwed for the foreseeable future sucks as a fan
hiphopheads,not_removed,how
hiphopheads,not_removed,after shipping
hiphopheads,not_removed,when we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
hiphopheads,not_removed,that is amazing plus shipping is kind of ridiculous though
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not vr at all though
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow if so thats pretty cool
hiphopheads,not_removed,i can confirm that the pharos shows were indeed filmed with vr cameras
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre from the ktt thread those dudes hate reddit
hiphopheads,not_removed,official leak is out now
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope you did dude also i hope you have a cd drive so you can rip it lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,he should honestly be passing out free shipping with that price tag lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,to new zealand sorry donald thats gonna be a no from me
hiphopheads,not_removed,im sure he has some control
hiphopheads,not_removed,well then i expect some amazing packaging as well gatefold inserts printed sleeves gram
hiphopheads,not_removed,was that for mondo if it was i understand man im on a budget so i dont want to look at that site right now especially with that gremlins release and the restocking of the guest shit ive got a problem im working on
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah people bitching about jeffery costing on vinyl when i pay that to ship anything to me in australia
hiphopheads,not_removed,to nz fuck me sideways
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i ended up buying it too wanted the poster
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really wanted to support him but that shipping charge is crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,ramen cents ingredients to make it a viable meal option
hiphopheads,not_removed,baby you got a stew going
hiphopheads,not_removed,just go buy yourself some ramen fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,is he not having a general release i wouldve purchased it but i had no idea about it until monday
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk both kind of out there people they always seem to have that kind of zoned out bizzare delivery in music vids
hiphopheads,not_removed,man that is too much
hiphopheads,not_removed,the ramen noodle
hiphopheads,not_removed,well if you have a better idea im dying to hear it
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats ktt
hiphopheads,not_removed,the feeling is mutual
hiphopheads,not_removed,their entire website is trash comments and memes thats a very low bar for reddit to somehow not pass
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah i didnt i figured id wait for a vinyl release instead thats much cheaper than this
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah for sure lol but i know its not bino whos charging us the shipping costs i doubt he has any idea of this at all or any word on costs shipping costs from big labels like this have always been fucked
hiphopheads,not_removed,weird it could help that he owns his own distribution company i think third man records but yeah idk guess it can go either way
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep a good chunk of my vinyl collection is from mondo ive spent too much money over there
hiphopheads,not_removed,really thanks man i might have to go look at that
hiphopheads,not_removed,you know how big that poster is right
hiphopheads,not_removed,egg cents
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think i want my money back
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn right this hobby is too expensive lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,id guess its a visual experience ie degree video most likely utilized by via an included phone sleevecradle ala google cardboard scored by the album most likely abstract visualsmontages much much less likely due to the cost and technology restraints could be an actual series of degree music videos least likely but obviously marketing goat material an actual vr experience that allows you to do more than simple adjust your field of view on the fly ie interact source am marketing guyproducerdirector at high end tech co with an emphasis on vr in designcustomer facing experiences
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a game for vr headsets where you can listen to the vinyl in vr
hiphopheads,not_removed,what im just saying that has nothing to do with virtual reality
hiphopheads,not_removed,kanyetothe just another hip hop blog
hiphopheads,not_removed,tbh a lot of memes here come from them and a lot of memes there come from here were pretty close to each other hypebeast forums on the other hand basically ktt knockoff fits within your comments guidelines for sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,how much was it in the store
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think bino himself thought of and personally punched in the shipping costs to the website
hiphopheads,not_removed,same ive been chilling out lately since theyve been doing less exclusive shit so i can just tell myself itll be there later
hiphopheads,not_removed,small bc if so shit but its all good
hiphopheads,not_removed,cmon fam youre just adding protein and cholesterol to carbs and sodium at least throw in some green onion
hiphopheads,not_removed,i could never pay that much for a record
hiphopheads,not_removed,can u get me a job fam howd you get into that
hiphopheads,not_removed,with your experience would you say the price is justified disregarding the fact that we havent heard the album yet edit or at least me not having heard it
hiphopheads,not_removed,why make it exclusive to the vinyl then why not bundle it with the cd as well or even sell it as its own separate thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean hypebeast forums has a much longer history than most reddit communites the reason tyler the creator is a thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,euros thats why i was so hesitant
hiphopheads,not_removed,true ive been shelling out for mitchells star wars portraits though lol the star wars fan in me cant resist
hiphopheads,not_removed,im pretty sure x so yeah pretty small
hiphopheads,not_removed,deep fried noodles too shits bad for you bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,ten years of getting my ass handed to me by out of touch idiots while safeguarding my creative voice thats how
hiphopheads,not_removed,it depends on the depth of the vr content honestly vr and even video is still very new expensive problematic and tough to fully realize without a wealth of resources and experts personally i love vinyl but it is ultimately a niche itemmarket generally from what ive seen lps in hiphop are not priced as competitively as say your niche indie music or punk artist and doing a double lp only adds to that cost right there maybe youve accounted for about of the price between it being a mainstream double lp before factoring in any of the cost for video work or any possible hard materials like a google carboardesque sleeve he may have gotten hooked the fuck up via experimenting directly with the director who he partnered with for the bti screenplayvideo projectatlanta but even with the notice that director is getting because of these projects some costs would be very hardlined and would have to be recouped via the price tag
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was really just a joke
hiphopheads,not_removed,vinyl sleeve would be big enough to include the collapsed cradlesleeve if thats where hes going with it think google cardboard
hiphopheads,not_removed,tru but its so toxic
hiphopheads,not_removed,ah okay the leak is already out now if you dont want to wait to listen to it
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh i dont touch those posters thats a darker path than the records last time i spent on two posters
hiphopheads,not_removed,its alright that leaves more room for more posters
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh damn my bad lol didnt realise you werent the same person who originally replied
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats for damn sure upvoting and downvoting is the only reason im the most active on reddit it promotes more quality discussion those old style forums are no bueno for quality convo
hiphopheads,not_removed,bro ive spent on postersprints from mondo its definitely a darker path lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah all good homie aha
hiphopheads,not_removed,your old stuff was better
hiphopheads,not_removed,now you are overrated
hiphopheads,not_removed,who are your main influences
hiphopheads,not_removed,we good
hiphopheads,not_removed,were all super busy rn maybe next time
hiphopheads,not_removed,im bout to drop an album on your ass
hiphopheads,not_removed,not beef just competition
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpssoundcloudcomdksetsnashvillenights i wasnt playing lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,leave
hiphopheads,not_removed,they just released this bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,ur gonna have to format that fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,barter and jeffery aint albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,fam no one can read that wall of text format and consolidate
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to tha carter tha carter dedication da drought no ceilings not saying those are his best but thats the order id suggest for someone new to wayne
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to dedication first skip i am not a human being
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely the carter drought no celings and no celings he really is a discography artist him at age on the bigtymers and hotboys albums is cool to hear then degrees was a classic then from the carter on he just kept progressing and getting more creative and ever evolving
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is terrible
hiphopheads,not_removed,no you did a good job you little robot
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey guys can you do my research for me dude just google it the wkipedia pages alone give you a bunch of info
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really dont understand why hhh and and hiphopheads in general sleep on krit its probably cuz hes from the south and people think his accent is somehow dumb i grew up in atlanta but my parents are from a rural area so krit really speaks to me and has become one of my favorite artists for his blend of southern esscence and experimental hip hop vibe the dude can rap on any beat he can also produce any beat hes got intellectual songs deep songs moody songs every emotion you can think of hes put into a beautiful cohesive track that somehow still manages to amanda nunes knock the fuck out of my sub and he mostly creates it all himself yet people still fucking sleep yall sleepin on the best rapper of our generation man his next project is gonna be his magnum opus i just know ive been a fan since krit wuz here maybe one day yall will remeber the king in time
hiphopheads,not_removed,one of my favorite artist honestly and i even sleep on him sometimes
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant wait for his new album
hiphopheads,not_removed,coming from a big krit fan whos from michigan now lives in the south and normally not a big southern rap fan outside of a handful he doesnt have a very diverse sound the production from mixtape to mixtape or album to album all sounds very similar plus he doesnt really have a standout project all of his projects are pretty good great in my opinion but theres not really a consensus project thats the outlier in a good way and most of his mixtapes albums just have a handful of filler songs i fucking love the dude hes consistently in my top it varies usually depending on whos dropping whos hot right now etc but he just doesnt have that songs or that album which for a lot of people that doesnt matter because his stuff is consistently really dope and high quality but it doesnt really vary from track to track or album to album the vent is one of my top songs of all time though
hiphopheads,not_removed,cause dumb people wanna listen to easy music and krits to lyrical focused for a lot of people
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes of def and started his own label right is there any information on his next album
hiphopheads,not_removed,never heard any of big krits songs but judging from this song alone id say his rhymes are kind of obvious not just the subject matter but the actual rhyme scheme seems simple you could have told me the first verse was a random soundcloud rapper with followers and id have the same reaction
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe its this song idk thats pretty insulting to krit imo heres a few tracks you should listen to
hiphopheads,not_removed,adding my two cents somedayz children of the world bangers
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats why i said judging from just this song ive been the biggest lupe fan since his mixtapes but if you introduced me to lupe with this verse i wouldnt continue listening the same for this krit verse its just very obvious how hes going to rhyme sounds like a typical abab rhyme scheme ill check out his other music thanks for the links i didnt mean to diss him its just judging from this verse alone
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh yeah i understand the sentiment huge lupe fan as well they have a song together on lupes drogas light album that just came out httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqbgzwymbmeg
hiphopheads,not_removed,underrated track cant wait for more upcoming music from nas
hiphopheads,not_removed,i remember reading kendrick loves this track its a great cut off my second favorite nas album nas and az are always amazing together
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn that would mean a lot to me i added this to a playlist when i went over nas disco three or four years ago and now its a strict member of my nonskip list ill never listen to this song and not say nas part in the intro with him lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was a point in time where i was just into buying cds heavy and that was one of them i purchased one of my favorite tracks on there was him and az the flyest we the flyest gangsters i just thought it was a dope vibe had a west coast feeling and spitting some of the most intricate lyrics on there its one of nas best tactics as far as storytelling as well him spitting raps backward i mean come on thats genius
hiphopheads,not_removed,always loved this track when priest starts out by talking about how his skin is solid pewter and at the end when he threw away me change bucket dropped my crutches the faces of the public screamed for justice damn his voice is nasal and low and not conducive a dope flow his flow isnt the tightest his verbal dexterity isnt sick but lyrically the man has style and chops
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song is going to be a big hit
hiphopheads,not_removed,virgil ablohoff white used a loop of the xxl freestyle during a fashion show last week lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,hot damn i feel like that timmy timmy timmy turner hate on twitter is gonna switch up real quick when this comes out joking about desiigners sawed off shotgun of a nose will prob stay though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like this has been posted before but definitely stoked for this song
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant not see the kramer thing anymore that alone makes me wish him so much success as an artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,imma spontaneously combust mid dab when hq drops
hiphopheads,not_removed,link
hiphopheads,not_removed,might have been i hadnt seen it on here yet though
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,wrong desiigner the desiigner signed to kanye has two is
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is like a shitty attempt at trying another versace
hiphopheads,not_removed,this video was much more cringey than i anticipated
hiphopheads,not_removed,delete this
hiphopheads,not_removed,what
hiphopheads,not_removed,major release on datpiff smfh
hiphopheads,not_removed,the torment
hiphopheads,not_removed,no thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,sick track bro love the hook this track is going to blow up
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a bot if you have any suggestions you can message my creator here
hiphopheads,not_removed,such a good song i love how they flow with beat way better song than calm down at least in my opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,calm down was so disappointing
hiphopheads,not_removed,cause the beat sucked got annoying so fast ems verse was good though
hiphopheads,not_removed,relevant but so bad funny but poorly done lil b needs to call kd out on actual basketball things that kd has done or failed to do insult seattle okc or something challenge kd to a freestyle or something asking him to play you in basketball the thing he literally gets paid millions of dollars to do is stupid
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is so wack for so many reasons ppd yes lawd above malibu
hiphopheads,not_removed,the best albums of hiphoprb are definitely on this list but i dont really agree that much on the order plus i think ab soul shouldve been somewhere on the list
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have yes lawd above malibu on my list while i can see that malibu is probably a better project musically and narratively i enjoy the vibe and sound of the former more i love the old samples and drums and paaks sensual and dirty voice over malibus tighter and cleaner production and vocals so for my musical taste yes lawd is the better project or at least i enjoy it more which is all that matters with an aoty list
hiphopheads,not_removed,refreshing sound my favorite is muse of may
hiphopheads,not_removed,judging by interviews its honestly sort of crazy how logics image has changed so much over the year im a big logic fan but like he legit looks and talks like the most stereotypical middle aged nerdy white dude now might just be the glasses tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,man i hate when artists do this just release your album and let the music speak for itself especially in a case like this where the lyrics arent exactly difficult to unpack
hiphopheads,not_removed,was his image different than nerdy white guy in the past ive only known about him since tits
hiphopheads,not_removed,i see where youre coming from but i think its just geniuss way of giving more of a personal feel to their service
hiphopheads,not_removed,couldnt agree more ispy had a video doing the same doesnt take a rocket scientist to break down the lyrics to that song lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,he used to walk around all black clothes with gold chainz and watches he talked about it he said he doesnt give a fuck anymore if people percieve him to be him hop or not he realized he doesnt fit in and doesnt give a fuck if we dont fuck with him he said that literally while wearing some nerd glasses brown khakis and rick and morty shirt i personally give him so much props for that there is still so many rappers today who we praise as the realest ogs but they arent themselves
hiphopheads,not_removed,he literally got put on by faze clan
hiphopheads,not_removed,he was always pretty cool with his clothing but he just used to be a bit more street given he grew up in a rough area of baltimore but he was never into drugsalcohol and he got married recently and has just embraced the nerd in him
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah definitely i think even nas has explained some of his lyrics on genius not in video format though so it isnt like this is some unique situation i just prefer that guys trust listeners to decipher things themselves
hiphopheads,not_removed,might not acquainted edit check out his pass dat remix
hiphopheads,not_removed,its pray love btw anyways crew love is awesome
hiphopheads,not_removed,in this post comment will update with media shared in comments downvote if unwanted selfdeletes if score is less than rchrisolivertimes rradditplaylists
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,love that song and especially the music video
hiphopheads,not_removed,bumping right now so much good music dropped today we eating
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely check this guide that someone made to finesse with channel orange it is one of the best things i have ever read httpswwwredditcomrhiphopheadscommentswdspqthephdsofficialchannelorangepimpguide
hiphopheads,not_removed,the panties by mos def cruel intentions by jmsn miguel frank ocean dangelo
hiphopheads,not_removed,specifics on though last artists
hiphopheads,not_removed,dangelo untitled the root spanish joint miguel the valley pussy is mine coffee frank ocean pyramids
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was hot i listened to it since the release meek is hard to listen to his accent and him shouting doesnt help takes me to get what hes saying overall a damn good joint features were goodgreat held his own throughout the album any album featuring thug is an automatic classic so theres that
hiphopheads,not_removed,any album featuring thug is an automatic classic this here is objectively facts
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah exactly how i felt about him but this project definitely surpassed expectations blue notes is crazy to me the productions beautiful
hiphopheads,not_removed,indeed
hiphopheads,not_removed,il post my tape fam lmao where are the mods now
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil uzi a beast yuuuuuuuuh
hiphopheads,not_removed,kiss land in my opinion was amazing and pitchfork gave it a how tf did starboy score higher
hiphopheads,not_removed,fair for just another pop album with catchy tunes
hiphopheads,not_removed,sounds about right but it honestly is crazy hat its lower than bbtm which i feel was a bit worse than this album seems like the they gave that album was too high honestly
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats generous if you ask me theres not a single track that really stands out for me tracks like the hills and i cant feel my face were so punchy and catchy i cant help but find this album drab and repetitive
hiphopheads,not_removed,accriate
hiphopheads,not_removed,when you realize bbtm is the highest scored album in that site
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly kinda surprised by the score this is probably my favorite project by the weeknd this shit makes me do my shoulder dance and thats one of the only things that i really look for from him its no but i havent really listened to much else this week
hiphopheads,not_removed,i found myself hating to agree with pitchfork on this one love the weeknd and was waiting for starboy to come out and be another classic as they said in the review it sounded like an opportunistic compilation of bsides for most part having said that there are at least songs that i have been playing on repeat for a few days this is rare for an add millennial like myself also since when songs is considered an overkill pitchfork please
hiphopheads,not_removed,this bum is so fucking at least a seven best pop music out right now better than bbtm so idk
hiphopheads,not_removed,deserves a just not enough critic bait for pf
hiphopheads,not_removed,i bet you idiots cant even divide by i can read up to words per minutes and i can make a better album than this
hiphopheads,not_removed,i guess you dont understand opinions like you think you do
hiphopheads,not_removed,kissland was just a watered down trilogy thats why sorry dont kill me trilogy was amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,pitchforks reviews are fucking trash imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,ima put you six feet under six feet under six feet under
hiphopheads,not_removed,whom womans
hiphopheads,not_removed,never thought id hear rockin and secrets described as weird
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,explain why you think it deserves a house of ballons which is widely considered to be his best work got an from
hiphopheads,not_removed,what
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao what does this mean
hiphopheads,not_removed,get a load of this guy
hiphopheads,not_removed,riamverysmart
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree to some extent but i think kiss land is his most eclectic and experimental musically i think its better than thursday at least and a million times better than bbtm and starboy
hiphopheads,not_removed,kissland was an evolution of trilogy in my eyes a fucking fantastic project imo that much of this sub and everyone else underrates i still listen to it cover to cover and enjoy it a lot
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre right its what a major label thought trilogy was
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont see what differentiates this album at all the lyrics are as shallow and generic as possible and most could be on any radio song the song structures are basic and run of the mill so many of the songs are surface level commercial radio bait the only special thing about the album is that its good old abel and hes an artist unlike those other guys chris brown could have made this album bar a couple songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,if someone doesnt like the new album does that really mean that they want another house of balloons im asking because ive been criticized for the same thing after i said this album was mediocre
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude in zane lowes interview he literally said he did the same thing as trilogy he said he expected his fans to think starboy would come after trilogy but he decided to keep doing the same thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,most of the time people bring up his old shit whenever they mention his new stuff its so annoying
hiphopheads,not_removed,his lyrics have always been shallow sure but they were at least semi unique anyway i dont see what his previous work has to do with this albums quality and how pop it is i dont see how this is nothing like any pop project the songs are verse chorus verse chorus the songs are centred around attempts at catchy hooks the majority of the songs have nothing unique artistically shit like die for you is so clichéd lyrically and musically whats special about this
hiphopheads,not_removed,really i feel like ive heard of the songs somewhere else before
hiphopheads,not_removed,nothing like any pop project are you deaf its incredibly generic poprnb
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude a majority of songs regardless of genre are like verse chorus verse chorus and ive said it before mostly everything in every genre has been talked about or done lyrically and musically what do you expect
hiphopheads,not_removed,what what are these differences you keep mentioning them but you havent given a single example
hiphopheads,not_removed,actually all tracks are in spotifys top global
hiphopheads,not_removed,mostly everything in every genre has been talked about or done lyrically and musically by this logic we cant comment on any albums originality or lack thereof im not expecting him to make some album of mongolian throat singing over ambient noise instrumentals i just want something interesting something compelling false alarm is my favourite track on here because it sounds unique it sounds like he took a risk hes capable of doing things structurally unique even removing the sound of house of balloons something like the title track has a beat switch a loose structure extended outro fine hes allowed to make the music he wants but i just find it odd how his fans elevate this way past what it is you can like it and admit its run of the mill
hiphopheads,not_removed,its true though but this classic weeknd lyrics drugs sex and some love party monster is a good example i feel it coming sidewalks stargirl interlude starboy false alarm are all pretty unique music wise sure theres like generic tracks which i enjoy though rockin is for sure a huge generic track and secrets party monster has a pretty catchy extended outro idk if thats youre looking for stargirl is a loose structure false alarm also has a cool outro
hiphopheads,not_removed,fair point but i do think the onus was on him to prove his point the more dancey electronic sound like on rockin is very popular right now with major lazer chainsmokers etc using it a lot the die for you song archetype has been around for ages chris brown even has a song with that title pop songs with those melodramatic proclamations are far from new i feel it coming sounds straight out of an movie party monster sounds like any dark ovo sound artist could have come out with it on the majority of the songs a typical song structure is followed namely verse centrepiece chorus verse without any radical changes
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao so basically youre saying you have no argument except you like it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think that even if the lyrics are classic weeknd that doesnt exempt them from criticism maybe those lyrics just arent compelling enough to use on projects but i do think theyre a lot more toned down and bland here than before i dont agree about i feel it coming but yeah the others arent generic which is why those are the songs im ok with i think die for you rockin love to lay ordinary life secrets and more are completely generic party monster is maybe the most dull on here for me but yeah that outro was pretty cool i just feel like the interesting moments on here are too far apart and too few
hiphopheads,not_removed,because i think they are generic and boring is a super strong and well thought out argument im not gonna waste time writing up a review of starboy and analyzing the style of the song when its pretty clear the production on starboy is a mix of music techno and modern pop i cant recall any modern albums that have that but if you do then go ahead and post em
hiphopheads,not_removed,hmm well then if you dont like them here why would you like them from other projects i feel it comings sounds like a mj song ive seriously never heard a song like that from anyone else but the weekndexcept mj in the night also sounds like mj yeah those are generic but theyre catchy af so they are pretty fun to listen to but die for you seems unique tbh party monster i liked a lot because it had a trap and electronic type production and it felt so dark it just feels evil and he has a lot of voice effects on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i totally agree with you man
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think there are a few unique songs the title track and false alarm especially but something like die for you true colours ordinary life what is different about those how is that not emblematic of a pop sound from the lyrics to the production to the songs structures
hiphopheads,not_removed,regular guy is one of the most lit songs ive ever heard just thought i should throw that out there
hiphopheads,not_removed,poor mixing on the vocals compared to the instrumental drowns out the beat but you got potential in your bars keep at it
hiphopheads,not_removed,appreciate the feedback fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpsmsoundcloudcomcrowethiemsetsbeats heres some beats if you want to use em man
hiphopheads,not_removed,shady putting your own shit in the text box the classy move is putting your info in the comments like everyone else you aint special

hiphopheads,not_removed,sorry fuck kd
hiphopheads,not_removed,bitch im lil b
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly thought half of the album was exceptional and the other half was above average migos i slightly rank yrn the album higher because i felt that was more wellrounded for a migos release but the highs on culture are getting it so much more attention tshirt call casting bad boujee kelly price and deadz some of their best songs been following migos since yrn the mixtape theyve been shot down so many times the past few years when back to the bando came out i really thought they were close to the end glad to see the contrary
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok so im just saying pitchfork is definitely hopping on the migos wave rn because they gave it a bnm at which is pretty low for a bnm im not saying its not a good album im just saying pitchfork thinks its not bnm material but had to do it to ride the wave
hiphopheads,not_removed,after about listens im still surprised how well this plays front to back tshirt bad and boujee slippery what the price deadz and kelly price are the even numbered tracks on the record and all are incredibly dope so theres not a stretch on the album where you have consecutive average songs zero lowlights as well like whats considered the weakest track here out yo way anybody dissing this album because they overplayed the singles deserves a shoe to the head
hiphopheads,not_removed,whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo
hiphopheads,not_removed,kind of a silly review but it still reflects what migos are up to rn which is becoming finally a fully realized cultural force id expect them to chart much more often now and im honestly excited this album was fresh
hiphopheads,not_removed,then there are truly strange moments all ass from the albums uh back end sounds like magic city mixed with industrial berlin slippery in an inspired move turns a skrrt skrrt adlib into the songs melodic backbone even when culture grasps for the radio dial it skirts expectations pitchfork has some really weird takes sometimes i like all ass a lot but it sounds like a very standard trap single to me in terms of construction theyre making it sound like its somehow experimental and boundarypushing
hiphopheads,not_removed,someone says that trap albums always get reviews theres plenty of trap reviews that dont get and is the average review given to an album of any genre by trap isnt inherently worse than other genres
hiphopheads,not_removed,anything below getting a bnm is incredibly rare theres been a few to get it i think i cant recall for sure but ive never seen an get one i actually see a lot of metal albums that get that dont get bnm i think cilvia demo even got a and no bnm as far as recent stuff goes im aware that one mos def album got a and bnm but i definitely think pitchfork streamlined a lot more of their stuff from onward so i consider that one an anomaly my understanding of what bnm means based on articles ive read before is that anything that gets bnm means people who are fans of any genre would enjoy the project whereas something that doesnt get a bnm may be only more so enjoyable to people who like the genre its in that explains why theres a few metal releases that dont get bnm despite getting above an whereas just about anything that gets above a gets bnm additionally i think that they consider anything that gets bnm to be pushing the genre forward instead of just purely being a really good release that doesnt do anything new necessarily
hiphopheads,not_removed,slippery and kelly price stole the show really good trap album and im surprised pitchfork went this high for its score
hiphopheads,not_removed,cop the vinyl before hipsters snap it up and extort it on discogs
hiphopheads,not_removed,i had a feeling this would get bnm i liked some of the album but i gotta admit i just dont think trap is for me i understand why people are into it though
hiphopheads,not_removed,thing that pissed me off about this album are all the singles are right after each other and when you have apple music youve already overplayed those songs in that order when they first came out as singles
hiphopheads,not_removed,while the migos are decidedly of atlanta coupled with some cadences from up in tennessee their records frequently remind you of raps earlier years when creative kids holed up in bedrooms and tried to impress or make each other laugh—think the migos is dead or bizarre ride ii nawfside you have got to be absolutely fucking kidding me the migos is dead that doesnt even make sense grammatically groanworthy paul should be fired for that entire sentence also it would be the nawfside paul that aside this review is bad but thats unsurprising again barely touching on the musicality of the album in favor of shoe horning quirky shit like the sentence above
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think the singles are much better than the rest of the album but i also think many of the other tracks will grow on me songs on this album are pretty dissapointing all ass what the price for me but i also really enjoy some of the non single songs as well slippery and big on big if i had never heard the singles id give it an but having heard them i think is a pretty fair score is it better than no label or yrn i think they have definitely upped the musicality but those albums are trap classics imo i do wish cocoon and some of the songs they released last year were on this tape tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,virtuosic rapping ok lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,pitchfork is ass
hiphopheads,not_removed,pitchfork is garbage its a bunch of shithead english majors who went to harvard jerking off because they use big words and shitty analogies
hiphopheads,not_removed,he always hits his cs and ks hard which gives them that nice cut in his verses
hiphopheads,not_removed,chorus on slippery is goat def makes the best songs of the album list in my opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,tshirt is a really good song love the vibe it gives off
hiphopheads,not_removed,completely agree with your first statement songs like call casting brown paper bag and big on big are above average songs but kelly price deadz tshirt get right witcha and all ass are crazy good even after the hype theyre great songs glad the migos kept the project short so people really put their time into these songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think kelly price is easily the worst or second worst song on the album all the singles are great get right witcha big on big slippery culture minus khaled brown paper bag and out yo way are all definitely better than kelly price
hiphopheads,not_removed,just curious did you think back to the bando was their weakest project
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like out ya way a lot too
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think its the lowest score with bnm breaking james blakes record with the colour in anything last year
hiphopheads,not_removed,has always been on the migos train theyve never given them anything below a on a fulllength
hiphopheads,not_removed,stop taking pitchfork so seriously
hiphopheads,not_removed,bnm is seperate from the score the score is decided by the individual writer bnm is decided by all the staff
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow you guys really know how to stretch sometimes
hiphopheads,not_removed,out yo way is my tune g to each his own
hiphopheads,not_removed,weakest track big on big
hiphopheads,not_removed,out yo way is my favorite usually skip bpb and deadz
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpssoundcloudcombootymathbadandboujeebutitsjustoffsetsayingwoowoowoowoowoo
hiphopheads,not_removed,migos skrrt expectations
hiphopheads,not_removed,i will defend this conspiracy until i die
hiphopheads,not_removed,ya the only one i can remember is that getting and bnm definitely rare to see edit kind of disappointed that they didnt pull a power move today and give another album an or but with no bnm
hiphopheads,not_removed,pitchfork rides waves and gives bnm to shit that is already popular so hey get page hits metal doesnt give them page hits so they never give it or other less popular genres bnm
hiphopheads,not_removed,the sentence u quoted is about the musicality of the album tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a reference to de la soul is dead smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,see how upset youre getting all that emotion and it turns out youve misunderstood completely maybe just chill next time
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like migos but what is it about them that causes them to be painted as some revolutionary generation defining act they as a group are nowhere near as creative and mould breaking as de la soul or the pharcyde and thats doubly true for this album which isnt substantially different from anything theyve done before
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea i read that and was like boi stop ehhh even saw the number and was like come on we get it yall dick riding anyways if you want more reviews on any other album for that matter not just this album check out has a review up so should be nice and av club does too so they know their shit from time to time personally im waiting for best of line fits review and loud quiets
hiphopheads,not_removed,what are the cadences of tennessee pitchfork is so garbage and lol the migos
hiphopheads,not_removed,you dont like whats the price what is wrong with u
hiphopheads,not_removed,their numbers would say otherwise
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey dude do you not like pitchfork i cant tell based on this thread if you enjoy them or not
hiphopheads,not_removed,went to harvard thats giving them way too much credit lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats the biggest word you didnt understand in the review
hiphopheads,not_removed,just chill yo
hiphopheads,not_removed,i find their reviews ironically racist tbh i cant explain how but i cant be only who feels that way
hiphopheads,not_removed,takeoffs verse makes it imo its easily a verse
hiphopheads,not_removed,i rock woahtur diamonds im drippen buh not slippen
hiphopheads,not_removed,bpb and all ass are actually becoming my favorites now after not initially liking them
hiphopheads,not_removed,smashing your hoe on the low and she calling me dad so many of these hooks are catchy as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant get into kelly price either only part i like is travis there must be something i dont get about that song but its really dull sounding favorite tracks are out yo way and get right witcha outside of the singles for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,no the hype was at an all time low though
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah the lowest is with this obscure ep the threshold for bnm doesnt necessarily correlate with the score i take the designation literally its the best new music out at the moment the common threshold for automatic bnm is from what ive noticed pitchfork occasionally give bnm to lower score albums if its hyped as fuck at the moment and it lives up to the hype publicly but maybe not quite critically there are occasionally some oddball reviews too drakes thank me later got a without bnm
hiphopheads,not_removed,a lot of people will reply to this with exceptions so lets just suffice it to say that there are plenty of exceptions
hiphopheads,not_removed,mos def got an bnm for ecstatic
hiphopheads,not_removed,wavves wavvves got an back in
hiphopheads,not_removed,jayzs the black album got bnm with an
hiphopheads,not_removed,after the bnm tag was introduced in it was used pretty sporadically you can find albums with scores without bnm over time it became more codified and at this point and above is an automatic bnm for any nonmetal genre with a smattering of here and there an hasnt been given bnm in years i think since
hiphopheads,not_removed,pitchfork definitely over rate a lot of trap and drill albums to seem cooler and more relevant its fun music but neither are album genres and that should be obvious
hiphopheads,not_removed,whos that in your flair
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is completely true there has been a dry spell for music
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty sure pitchfork has never confirmed how their scoring system actually works ive heard a few different rumors for how they do it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought the score and i assume bnm was decided by the staff and they just match the review from a writer to what correlates best with the score could be completely off on how the process works felt like i remember reading that in some reddit thread once upon a time
hiphopheads,not_removed,if youve seen how pitchfork rates reviews and lists thats not a stretch at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats kind of my whole point as i also think out yo way is pretty dope theres not a single track here that i could call the weakest without offending somebody
hiphopheads,not_removed,so theres not a stretch on the album where you have consecutive average songs all you had to do was finish reading the sentence
hiphopheads,not_removed,i fuck with this
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,sounds like luigi
hiphopheads,not_removed,its based on a misconception that trap is inherently bad with a couple good apples basically how people treat southern music in general
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre grading it for what it is not comparing it to masterpieces if they dont like bad trap projects they probably wont review them
hiphopheads,not_removed,as you should
hiphopheads,not_removed,you so antipitchfork lol you must understand that there are publications and critics who analyze music through an artistic lens rather than a subjective lens subjectivity was created by the culture industry to ensure that what is otherwise considered mediocre or bad art can continue to sell despite critics httpsenwikipediaorgwikicultureindustry please check yourself before you shit on anything this type of slight bigotry is lame and stagnates cultural awareness and knowledge
hiphopheads,not_removed,was one of the first publications to take trap seriously theyve been reviewing migos since they came out and been giving them consistently good scores
hiphopheads,not_removed,well if were being semantic its about the migos in general
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah pretty obvious especially next to the pharcyde reference
hiphopheads,not_removed,well it would be the migos are dead which it doesnt matter because that doesnt work with the reference and because the sentence is stupid as fuck anyway yo you changed the sentence imma report shit originally said how the migos is correct grammatically but mods are shapeshifting lizard people from the hollow earth
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre good at what they do
hiphopheads,not_removed,because the newest thing has to be the best thing or its a failure
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah god forbid he actually liked the album and gave it a score based on that
hiphopheads,not_removed,av club i mean pitchfork is trash but boy
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyve referred to themselves as the migos on cross the country pipe it up migo dream amazing amy fema migos origin cocaina highway bars trenchez pound cake freestyle top floor switch a roo payola came from nothing long time came to party spray the champagne aight trap funk on top do you really think donald glover who had them on his tv show didnt know how to say their name at the golden globes
hiphopheads,not_removed,cadence may not be the most accurate word but it probably refers to three mafia the closest group i could think of that resembles migos lord infamous was known for using a triplet flow that migos obviously brought back to the spotlight
hiphopheads,not_removed,bcos they use three flow who are from tennessee fairly straightforward
hiphopheads,not_removed,when you dont understand what a word means so you think a website is garbage just cause yo vocab is trash doesnt mean pitchfork is to lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,wtf
hiphopheads,not_removed,or maybe its just that rap is becoming more popular these days
hiphopheads,not_removed,takeoffs verse on deadz goddamn
hiphopheads,not_removed,all ass is dope as fuck i dont get the hate catchiest hook on the project imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,all ass is a club banger its my favorite behind the singles
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree i wouldnt call it a bad song but compared to what else is on this gem of an albumdamn
hiphopheads,not_removed,lots of stuff gets no bnm
hiphopheads,not_removed,hmm i always though and above got bnm automatically til
hiphopheads,not_removed,tru dat
hiphopheads,not_removed,jesus theres a band i havent thought about in years
hiphopheads,not_removed,criminally low score
hiphopheads,not_removed,they rate the albums on what they are and what they try to accomplish a good trap mixtape will get a better score than a terrible one its not that complicated
hiphopheads,not_removed,trap has a lot of potential but they panned by their standards rodeo which is often considered the best the genre has to offer recently
hiphopheads,not_removed,kool ad
hiphopheads,not_removed,the greatest rapper alive in the world
hiphopheads,not_removed,heres some insight into how it works
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have it is a stretch
hiphopheads,not_removed,after listens i agree i dont see why anyone would want to listen to this
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,its even here on this sub now i know a lot of people are gonna be like wait this sub doesnt give a fuck about lyricism and while thats true how often do you see people shit on trap and then other people reply like well its trap music its not meant to be profound or that good its just hype music that bangs bruh mindless bangers that sound good bruh even tho people here enjoy trap and southern music they dont give it the respect it deserves as an artform most of the time i feel like
hiphopheads,not_removed,you aint told a lie yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like trap mixtapesalbums are rated too high but its more because the artists are often putting out tons of material and dont take as much care in making each project a full work of art on its own a lot of trap mixtapes kind of just feel like a collection of whatever new shit theyve been working on as opposed to an album in another genre where they spent years making a complete project
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,analyze music through an artistic lens rather than a subjective lens ye but thats not for pop music thats wire quietus even tmt and ra at times but is pure tastemaker garbage
hiphopheads,not_removed,people with takes like this need to fuck off and go listen to some twelve tone serialism or something i dont even know how to unpack all the ways this stance is awful
hiphopheads,not_removed,username checks out
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not being semantic its just you
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wonder what dude thinks about stakes is high
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean its just a review and youre very animated about this but youre right its hilarious how he wrote the migos is dead and not migos is dead like what
hiphopheads,not_removed,the migos are dead strays too far from the de la soul reference de la soul have said we are de la soul but that doesnt mean that de la soul is dead is a trash album bc grammar i edited my comment bc at first i thought you were tryna say that the migos is an improper way to refer to migos despite them referring to themselves as the migos on several occasions out of curiosity do you think that stakes is high is trash bc of the grammar
hiphopheads,not_removed,they absolutely are and id have been perfectly happy if thats what this review said but pitchfork is the one that brings two of the most influential albums of all time into this
hiphopheads,not_removed,the way offset comes in right after takeoff is some heavenly shit no time to comprehend wat just happened just back to back bars
hiphopheads,not_removed,thou has an album that came out in that got an and no bnm its a really subjective title
hiphopheads,not_removed,isaiah rashad got an and no bnm ended up on their best of the year list too during a pretty weak year for music always thought it deserved bnm range
hiphopheads,not_removed,i actually still really like that whole genre im seeing cloud nothings tomorrow
hiphopheads,not_removed,for real the only song on that album i dont like is change clothes prob controversial but it just isnt the type of song i want to hear jay on
hiphopheads,not_removed,so an trap album could be as replayable as a whole as a in a genre which is more substanceoriented fair enough if so i guess
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol its only highly rated by this sub
hiphopheads,not_removed,best rapper in the world
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean you dont need to look any further than the thread when culture dropped the comments were an ironic meme fest
hiphopheads,not_removed,southern rap music is scene as a trend here the south has something to say is just as applicable today
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont listen to much trap but to me it all sounds the same this album all blended together and i find it hard to differentiate between the songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,frank ocean wrote channel orange in a week king gizzard plan on releasing albums this year it doesnt take years to make a good project futures robert horry run is better than a lot of artists entire discography
hiphopheads,not_removed,nice to see someone fighting for what they believe in
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay completely ignore its influence on american indie culture if that makes you feel any better
hiphopheads,not_removed,its supposed to be ironic but thanks lol i wouldnt trip about it eventually literature will be removed from the united states curriculum as no one is learning shit from it
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay but youre objectively wrong right now that sentence was about the migos as a whole
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just like shitting on pitchfork cus i care about the quality of critical reviews and shit and the amount of bullshit they get away with really gets me heated i realize a lot of people dont share my view but as the most notable music review site basically they do such stupid shit all the time
hiphopheads,not_removed,not at all i think if youre gonna do a reference like that you should atleast make it flow well he really shoehorned it in
hiphopheads,not_removed,life without sound is so good its a bit less harsh than their other albums sound wise but it really sounds like their craftsmanship has continued to mature
hiphopheads,not_removed,oooh you got me heated for this one
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i love rodeo but whenever it comes up everyone i know fucking despises rodeo as a long boring and generic future clone album
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks i saw him live a few years ago and couldnt remember how it went when we chanted it
hiphopheads,not_removed,the live listen update comments where every single track is firebangerdingerslaps and some sudden random offhand comment about something homosexual with the artist that is literally just a setup for someone to write nephewwhatpause should be banned tbf
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly its like xd dae real trap shit but serious tho it bangs instead of actual substance
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean you dont need to look any further than the thread when culture dropped the comments were an ironic meme fest thats all first impression threads tbf
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was one of the worst first release threads ive ever seen
hiphopheads,not_removed,frank ocean wrote channel orange in a week two weeks come on man what kind of frankophile are you
hiphopheads,not_removed,frank ocean wrote channel orange in weeks but he spent at least a year actually recording the music and making the backing tracks and everything and futures projects in were all good and each one had a bunch of fantastic tracks but they all had filler too and it was clear they were thrown together in a short amount of time if he had taken the best tracks from each project and made them fit together as one piece of work it would have been worthy of critical acclaim
hiphopheads,not_removed,to add to this tupacs best album the seven day theory was written in a few days and including mixingetc it only took seven days
hiphopheads,not_removed,yup also a lot of albums that are a collection of newest songs with not coherence or connection as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks for proving my point is the definition of subjective criticism where music is graded on how it fits the american indie image
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was about the musicality of migos
hiphopheads,not_removed,adding the word the yea man thats stupid shit all the time
hiphopheads,not_removed,u mad cuz you popped off before realizing it went over your head
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not particularly well or poorly integrated certainly not worth complaining about
hiphopheads,not_removed,neptunes and jay were both at their peaks at the time that song came out and to me it feels like they didnt find a middle ground i would have loved jay on a dirtier beat that would normally have gone to clipse or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,crossing out the alive made me think he was dead rather than just that you got the lyric wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,the mods give the space so those people dont infect other threeads
hiphopheads,not_removed,agreed seen a lot of ppl in the culture thread who clearly just listen to it because its hot right now that havent even heard their mixtapes before basically hotpopular southern music is seen as a trend and thats why some listen to it i think not because they really like it but to just stay up to date again see the culture thread with dae witness something historic a lot of southern music is genuinely great and gets disregarded just because its not hot rn
hiphopheads,not_removed,tlop was less coherent than any trap album gave a last year
hiphopheads,not_removed,the writing in pitchfork reviews has been complete crap the senior editors dbags stosuy cohen richardson greene know people just read the scores youre right in that regard theres some intersection between the american indie image and what is considered artistic hint related to elitism im just acknowledging pitchforks ability to influence the culture they were the catalyst that arguably made swans death grips arcade fire popular it wasnt the writing either it was just the scores im indicating that through their scores they usually correctly gauge an albums ability to create an audience theyre pretty informed on the state of the culture anyway your username reminds me of someone on private music trackers who profusely hates kanye west that you lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea and i said the musicality of the album however i realize none of this matters and were arguing semantics and were all gonna die anyway and cease into nothingness on this big fire rock
hiphopheads,not_removed,really ridiculous how no one understand what the fuck my point is
hiphopheads,not_removed,its just an example of the kind of nonsensical badly flowing quirky shit they do i know you cape hard for pitchfork for whatever reason and i obviously have a distaste so this isnt going to anywhere anyway
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats so sad
hiphopheads,not_removed,i admit to have listened to culture simply because that thread hyped it up so much i had never really cared about migos before but the album convinced me to listen back to most of their old stuff and i really liked it so while i get what you mean we cant immediately discredit people who listen only due to the hype it can create some new fans
hiphopheads,not_removed,agreed but its on purpose to reflect his inner turmoil or some shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with this post and your original idea that there is nonsubjective criticism i just dont think that criticism that is more about the cultural signalling potential of the music than its aesthetic merits is nonsubjective also no id say kanye is among my top current hiphop artists
hiphopheads,not_removed,and he throws in the towel by saying some retarded shit not worth responding to
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe its that youre awfully expressing it if literally nobody gets it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean its not nonsensical just a little campy
hiphopheads,not_removed,agreed its the best defense mechanism it gets the shitposts out of peoples systems for the more serious discussion threads later on
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh i agree did not want to say that you can not listen to something just because you havent been since the start but there were only a handful that actually asked which older projects to listen to i just got the vibe that most were just there for the hype and memes and probably forget about the album as soon as the hype dies down
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpiimgurcomxwcphgnjpg
hiphopheads,not_removed,sure but its every big name review multiple times really tiring
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean i personally am not personally offended by it so the fact that they get a little campy in their reviews doesnt bother me
hiphopheads,not_removed,feel you
hiphopheads,not_removed,favorite song on hndrxx future singing his heart out has me feeling some type of way
hiphopheads,not_removed,this reminds me fuck anthony fantano
hiphopheads,not_removed,future always gives himself in his music for better or for worse its been a part of his persona since day people may mock what they consider his flaws on this album but to me it feels like hes being authentic and honest this song is a good example of that i get his music isnt for everyone but lets not act like we want every artist to abandon themselves in the pursuit of pleasing everyone
hiphopheads,not_removed,gushy gush so soaky
hiphopheads,not_removed,not good
hiphopheads,not_removed,meh
hiphopheads,not_removed,uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuusssssssss me
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats what i love about this album a lot of it is really sincere people will call it shallow or say some thats not complex lyricism shit but blunt honestly is something ive always liked about futures ballady songs codeine crazy has im an addict and i cant even hide it and sorry has sold crack to a pregnant lady forgive me for the crack baby and these lines arent incredibly complex bars or anything but theyre authentic to future and his experience and i appreciate that
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,is that you hopsin
hiphopheads,not_removed,im right with you here
hiphopheads,not_removed,yr old is a known asshole lol why would you ask him out of all people
hiphopheads,not_removed,they just kids man fuck them
hiphopheads,not_removed,i honestly had no idea lol by now i know he works with duwap kaine who is pretty cool so i figured hed be chill
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a kid too but i would never say this type of shit to a fan or anybody in general how tf you gonna earn respect when you pulling this type of shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,im and this happens alot to me too alot of people are nice in the soundcloud community you just gonna avoid people like yrs old
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats your sc
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea ive come across a lot of cool and helpful people on reddit and on soundcloud and other social media this is one of the first times somebody has just been a straight up ass and my soundcloud is httpssoundcloudcomasaptoxic whats yours
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpssoundcloudcomsnowee
hiphopheads,not_removed,i fucks with under the sea that shit sound good im trash at using samples and shit ive only been producing for about months so ive got a lot to learn
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks bro and yeah just keep grinding ive been doing it for about months still got a long way to go
hiphopheads,not_removed,amen
hiphopheads,not_removed,its pretty old now fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok i read the article twice now but i still dont get it you explained why content matters less in the internet age but how does that make the artists con artists also how do you know how much of older artists lyrics where really true they couldve been around a particular environment enough to tell a decent story but at the same the story could still be completely made up
hiphopheads,not_removed,the idea is that the content they produce tends to be false or exaggerated basically creating worlds that may not necessarily be true meanwhile the people who consume the content dont necessarily understand the context and take everything for truth
hiphopheads,not_removed,i kinda like post but i dont really fuck with anything on here
hiphopheads,not_removed,man those designs are terrible the only thing even remotely close to wearable are some of the hats
hiphopheads,not_removed,minecraft rapper wattba
hiphopheads,not_removed,this doesnt belong here
hiphopheads,not_removed,nevermind the fact that i think post malone is the biggest joke right now but why do all hip hop artists think they can get away with merch
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah the hats are some of the worst on here who the fuck wants to talk around with a too young on their fucking head like a tool b a date with a shitty font that looks awkward as hell c another dudes name
hiphopheads,not_removed,he has thing for and its a hoodie
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is an all artist thing and mostly because if people care enough they buy it
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey i wouldnt even come close to wearing any of this shit but compared to the shirts with race car flames and metallic print the too young hat look okay the post malone hat is maybe one of the worst ive even seen though
hiphopheads,not_removed,lots of people in smaller rock scenes sell cheap ass merch i cant tell you how many shirts ive gotten for less than the most expensive shirt i got was a long sleeve deafheaven one for like
hiphopheads,not_removed,try datpiffcom
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck i couldve sworn it disappeared off the face of the internet i know it was a simple suggestion but thank you i was worried i wouldnt find it
hiphopheads,not_removed,they saw the backlash and are scrambling to fix this
hiphopheads,not_removed,kanye drake collap drops
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was my first thought lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats mean i always see it but dont know
hiphopheads,not_removed,bro sound it out if you still didnt get it inbefour or in before meaning his clever or not clever post came before what he is taking about
hiphopheads,not_removed,ahh ive been trying to figure it outs as and couldnt come up with what it could be lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,most of eminems current devout followers werent born when this dropped facts oldmanhaterism beggingfordownvotes
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is real rap
hiphopheads,not_removed,always sucks when local beef affects venues where people are just trying to have a good time edit turns out the shooting had nothing to do with himhis show it was down the street but meek was holding a concert nearby so i assume the blogs thought it had something to do with him
hiphopheads,not_removed,fucking hellthe fact that very few people in these comments or the other threads i saw are taking this seriously is mind blowing people were shot dead i think your shitty meek jokes can wait
hiphopheads,not_removed,to be in all respect it is fucked that everyone is taking credit for the vid with their dumb watermarks
hiphopheads,not_removed,ct resident here this doesnt surprise me smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn this is tragic af rip to those who lost their life trying to enjoy it
hiphopheads,not_removed,the sound of someone cocking their weapon a few seconds after the first shot holy shit gave my goosebumps
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn that aint funny thats fucked
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is so sad
hiphopheads,not_removed,were they shooting at meek it seems like as soon as he stepped out you heard one shot
hiphopheads,not_removed,jeez make the violence stop
hiphopheads,not_removed,fucking christ those comments are horrible
hiphopheads,not_removed,never using the shots fired tag when its actually appropraite
hiphopheads,not_removed,dey dindu nuffin
hiphopheads,not_removed,i go to school minutes from oakdale my friends and i hit shows there all the time its sad to see shit like this go down when people i know could potentially have been at this show the venue is in kind of a shitty area but i never would have expected to hear of a shooting guess thats the crowd meek drags in
hiphopheads,not_removed,sounds about right
hiphopheads,not_removed,heres a better video
hiphopheads,not_removed,i guess that movie nightcrawler isnt too far off pretty disgusting stuff
hiphopheads,not_removed,its their job and its obviously wanted everybody here is watching and reading this shit and thats not fun but its true though
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah its fine just doing their job gotta get the scoop and that exclusive video for the boss thanks for sharing the video hope you get that karma
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think you missed the point by a little imreadyforthedownvotes
hiphopheads,not_removed,why u so concerned its just a video b chill
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh well now this becomes a story for my local news then not rhiphopheads
hiphopheads,not_removed,wrong this video is showing the entrance to the venue it happened right outside when the concert was letting out source mins away from oakdale and have been there too many times to know where this video takes place
hiphopheads,not_removed,get this trash off of this sub we dont need bullshit here
hiphopheads,not_removed,seriously
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea doesnt surprise me a bit either people who dont really know about ct assume its all mansions and wearing boat shoes theres a whole different side to connecticut that most people dont realize
hiphopheads,not_removed,im also from ct feels like every time our state gets in the news its for something dumb as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,of course youre a fucking warriors fan
hiphopheads,not_removed,how does this relate to the post
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek mill had the hardest rap album of
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,not a shitty area whatsoever thats why its kinda shocking
hiphopheads,not_removed,the venue is in kind of a shitty area so i think its important to clarify that by shitty area you mean its a slightly less affluent section of an average connecticut suburb theres not really any inherent risk of violence anywhere in wallingford
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah just went to schoolboy at the dome a couple months ago it was a relatively safe venue because of wallingford
hiphopheads,not_removed,im glad to see the adult telling the kids to stay down good to see someone acting levelheaded in a tense situation
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats only the tip of the iceberg
hiphopheads,not_removed,to be fair its how they make money whether you like it or not they thrive on news that shocks people
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats more aligned to the attitude of the news stations fighting over rights
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk doesnt it rub you the wrong way some reporter immediately tweets her well done holly im glad you got someone else potential death on video
hiphopheads,not_removed,same was wondering where the dude got that info
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not disagreeing but seeing as we can only hear the shots how do we know where the gunman was couldnt it have happened down the street yet still be heard on camera in front of the venue guns are pretty loud
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn bro did you get shot too or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,also from ct used to live near the town this shooting happened its a pretty quiet area already seeing some stellar fb posts about this kind of show shouldnt be in the area ugh
hiphopheads,not_removed,ct is a sea of very white very successful suburbs punctuated by several islands of abject poverty and violence the state is really good at lowkey creating conditions that segregate poor minorities from the rest of the good folk
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think at least new haven has the reputation of being gutta af im not too sure about any other cities there tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,from my experience isnt it where rich people from nyc who dont want to be recognized go to buy drugs
hiphopheads,not_removed,conversely people love to tout that violence happens here also were hardcore too guys promise as if you have to be violent to enjoy the culture its sad source hamden
hiphopheads,not_removed,the meth capital thats what a cabbie there told me
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont do us like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmaooo
hiphopheads,not_removed,was good in my opinion but it wasnt really a big deal for me id rate the album a but of course you are entitled to your own opinion but meeks career definitely isnt over he still has the skill for the rap game
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok calm down was good for like hours it was long gone and forgotten week after it came out like the best song on the tape is a thugger and song that has a way better version with him off it
hiphopheads,not_removed,views
hiphopheads,not_removed,in fact it was ranked safest town in the country just last year
hiphopheads,not_removed,that guy was so damn composed wow hats off to him for helping keep people focused
hiphopheads,not_removed,im saying tho why get down right there in my mind im thinking get to my car running away before whoever just shot walks out that place dumb or nah
hiphopheads,not_removed,its because they dont see that somebody died they dont see the person and their hopes and dreams they dont see their family and friends they see a potential bump in their ratings from having a story first they see a potential raise or promotion for bringing it to their boss
hiphopheads,not_removed,the shooting had nothing to do with meek mill or his concert and should be on this sub there were shootings in chicago last night why arent they being reported on rhiphopheads
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah wallingford is like stereotypical connecticut this isnt normal in that area at all source live minutes from where this happened have gone to this venue several times
hiphopheads,not_removed,the inequality between hartford and west hartford is honestly so striking
hiphopheads,not_removed,bridgeport stay away from bridgeport
hiphopheads,not_removed,new haven hartford bridgeport waterbury etc theres a bunch of spots in ct like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,hartford a lil bit
hiphopheads,not_removed,my buddy played basketball at new haven can confirm he is gutta af
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea idk why these people are trying to make ct sound like chicago
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao hamden has a unique subculture honestly
hiphopheads,not_removed,from hamden too it seems like everyone tries to prove ct is hard too smh it is sad
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah it gets wayyyy more boatshoe wallingford is more middle of the pack new canaan guilford greenwich obviously and other towns would be ahead of wallingford in terms of prep factor
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wasnt even a huge fan of him until what album do you think was harder in maybe the games i dont even know
hiphopheads,not_removed,had easily one of the worst verses on the whole project tho bada boom bada bing
hiphopheads,not_removed,calm dad for president
hiphopheads,not_removed,generally its not a good idea to just panic and start running when you hear gunshots its also possible they didnt know where it came from if you dont know where the shooter is you definitely shouldnt run because you could run directly into the line of fire if its someone just opening fire into a crowd aiming for maximum casualties you increase your odds of survival by getting on the ground you cant run faster than bullets if its somebody aiming for a specific person then getting down ensures youre not hit by a stray bullet
hiphopheads,not_removed,because they didnt happen outside of a meek mill concert not that hard to understand
hiphopheads,not_removed,i had to visit wallingford for training twice this year it just seemed really sleepy im more surprised meek played there rather than new haven proper
hiphopheads,not_removed,went to school in east hartford and the school was very involved in trying to improve east hartford building schools public buildings buying land but it seemed like everything backfired and has created some really terrible town gown relations
hiphopheads,not_removed,bridgeport isnt as bad as youre trying to make it sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,north end mostly
hiphopheads,not_removed,unh
hiphopheads,not_removed,true
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah games album was good but i think schoolboy q had the hardest album of in my opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,gotchu good info bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes but the shooting had nothing to do with meek mill
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a very suburbanrural area but new haven isnt really equipped for shows like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,aka pistol wavin new haven
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah it is i drive through bridgeport regularly some okay areas but most of it is stay away territory
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep frog hollow really bad area
hiphopheads,not_removed,yup center from turkey
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk man it had a miguel feature lol thats like an automatic disqualification but yeah it was good
hiphopheads,not_removed,the shooting happened right outside the concert venue what are you trying to say
hiphopheads,not_removed,username checks out
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i know i dont think it has to
hiphopheads,not_removed,new haven does have toads not sure if theyre currently closed or not seems on whether they have a liquor license at any given time the number of roofied underage kids brought from there on any given concert night is staggering and depressing
hiphopheads,not_removed,my guy i live on east main and chill in other parts regularly its not bad lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,stay in the north and south and youll be fine
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive lived innear hartford my whole life and have never heard of frog hollow just looked it up and if it includes trinity then it isnt north end if anything its the south
hiphopheads,not_removed,im saying that it was outside the venue and had nothing to do with the concert nothing to do with hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,its bullshit journalism and it should be removed
hiphopheads,not_removed,toads is open but its nowhere near the size of the venue that meek played at its mostly for local acts and lesser knownless popular artists
hiphopheads,not_removed,i got a friend that lives off of east main seems alright over there downtown is alright too i just wish there was more going on over there at night
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i messed up it is a bad area though
hiphopheads,not_removed,seems relevant enough to me although the headline is definitely misleading
hiphopheads,not_removed,its smaller but they used to play huge artists all the time
hiphopheads,not_removed,toads is tiny for meek and college street wont book acts like this for this exact reason
hiphopheads,not_removed,in this post comment will update with media shared in comments downvote if unwanted selfdeletes if score is less than rchrisolivertimes rradditplaylists
hiphopheads,not_removed,of the tweets are now deleted thats why you add the textscreens of the tweets to the op edit screens in the comment below
hiphopheads,not_removed,thought that said joe bidden i was about to go crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe budden pettiest rapper alive
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe budden will fuckin destroy meek and i love both but its true
hiphopheads,not_removed,this thread is ridiculous for a hip hop forum one would assume that everyone here would know how important budden has been to hip hop over the last decade or so but instead its the same joe budden got destroyed by lil b joe budden irrelevant shit that is spewed on twitter the mood muzik series was doing things that kanye pioneered years before he did it and yet he still gets no respect as much as yall wanna diss the dude if a track comes out meek is gonna get bodied
hiphopheads,not_removed,ofc its on twitter smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,its all part of the mission
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats the history of their beef and joe budden seems so talented but always is acting childish
hiphopheads,not_removed,twitter fingers
hiphopheads,not_removed,didnt joe budden kill his kid
hiphopheads,not_removed,the only reason i ever listened to so far gone is because i heard budden bumping successful on a video log these kids just dont know
hiphopheads,not_removed,all meek stans crying
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao this fool got bodied by lil fuckin b
hiphopheads,not_removed,well this feels like deja vu from exactly year ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,gawd im so tired of these beefs
hiphopheads,not_removed,still waiting on this fool to respond to lil b
hiphopheads,not_removed,pump it up was a long time ago joe im not even a huge fan of meek but joe budden is the definition of a mediocre mc in terms of popularity and content taking shots at both drake and meek is pretty lame but i guess he has a mixtape coming out or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,with coming this weekend and joes relevancy status right now meek should not and will not exercise this held joe to a pretty high respect level this is just whack imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,two irrelevant ass niggas
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe budden no one fucking cares release music or stfu
hiphopheads,not_removed,also this is what meek cpmmented on an ig post shouldve added this to op
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe wish a nigga would biden
hiphopheads,not_removed,this comment is in every thread about joe budden
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah but budden is a bitch for trying to stir shit up
hiphopheads,not_removed,budden taking shots at meek and drake is very telling that he has a project coming out soon i think both meek and budden are pretty standard and mediocre to be honest
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love a few of the mood muzik mixtapes but he is not nearly as important as youre making him out to be he has always been a clown a pedant an immature little boy and for as smart as some of his music is downright ignorant outside the booth even though i like some his music i cant fucking stand the guy
hiphopheads,not_removed,pump pump pump it up
hiphopheads,not_removed,your overstating joe buddens impact and im a budden fan the only reason hes been relevant for the past years is because of lhh you can put knowledgeable hip hop heads in a room with a bomb and say name joe budden songs that came out in the past years or else youll die and everyone will be dead
hiphopheads,not_removed,im sorry but joe buddens importance in hip hop is being ridiculously overstated here
hiphopheads,not_removed,the mood muzik series was doing things that kanye pioneered years before he did it im interested in this can you give some examples
hiphopheads,not_removed,leave britney alone
hiphopheads,not_removed,if budden cant talk shit because hes irrelevant then theres no reason why meek can rip on drake anyway meek is a million leagues below drizzy
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil b destroyed joe budden
hiphopheads,not_removed,everyone here would know how important budden has been to hip hop over the last decade or so man really you have too high expectations for this subreddit maybe years ago not saying most of rhhh is dumb year old white boys that know joe budden from pump it up and lil b but i wouldnt be lying besides maybe about being just white peoplenot gonna write paragraphs on it but it seems like its an age thing of people under the age of id say dont realize that budden is a part of slaughterhouse b what slaughterhouse is c that budden has bars d that budden is actually a good battle rapper especially for someone thats more of a classical style rapper than a battle one e his ear for talent
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe budden whack as fuck gee
hiphopheads,not_removed,i never really was a big fan of his music but after he was on tax podcast i was convinced dude retarded fuck joe budden
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe budden said something to the effect of meek is a gangster rapper and its weird to see him with nicki all booed up meek got mad and responded on instagram this was right before the drake beef when it felt like meek was on a new level of success after dreams worth more then money apprantly meek just said something and thats what we have today i also remenber on the breakfast club joe said he already laid a diss track for meek so he should still have that
hiphopheads,not_removed,tbh i think joe just wants to release his bars hes been writing since that drake beef he claimed he has been writing for fun of the sport but hed never release it maybe hes bored lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,what
hiphopheads,not_removed,added
hiphopheads,not_removed,as if so far gone wouldnt have still been the biggest mixtape of the year without joe buddens endorsement
hiphopheads,not_removed,isnt it hard to see your computer screen with drakes dick in your mouth
hiphopheads,not_removed,why you dissing meek with that username smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,i bet you were crying last week when budden was gonna release a drake diss track lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek has shown once again hes an idiot but this whole thread is filled with people more upset about this than either meek or joe lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,do people actually take lil b seriously i thought it was all one big in joke
hiphopheads,not_removed,your username is as relevant as it gets you spew that much bullshit no wonder it cant be flushed itd block a manhole you seem to spew so much of it
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe budden is the definition of a mediocre mc in terms of popularity and content hes mediocre in terms of popularity in terms of content hes anything but
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait is there a source on coming this weekend ive been really excited for it
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek had some words for him on instagram earlier apparently so this is not out of the blue
hiphopheads,not_removed,wiat what this weekend just made my weekend
hiphopheads,not_removed,with coming this weekend no way if this is true than you just made my night
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek was one of the best selling rappers last year wasnt he like not drake k dot j cole level but just below not really irrelevant
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao meek is a great rapper foh
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek mill aint irrelevant
hiphopheads,not_removed,didnt meek win a billboard award for sales this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao look at the positive reaction to all the songs he has put out since the drake beef hes put out better music than drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,everything meek has and will put out this year everything drake has put out this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,the term ether only applies to songs not ig posts
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe buddens got destroyed by lil b lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao he is infatuated with rappers lives nigga is a podcaster now
hiphopheads,not_removed,ill sticky my comment so this at the top
hiphopheads,not_removed,hahaha i kind of wish he ran this year not to go off topic but is going to be hot joe biden vs kanye
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe budden is that dude in your circle who gasses everyone up saying hes making positive changes every few months and then you run into him yelling at some poor guy in a bar hes never gonna change hes just a shitty person
hiphopheads,not_removed,tru
hiphopheads,not_removed,pumppump it up dies from bomb
hiphopheads,not_removed,to be fair his podcast and controversy with taxstone also keep him somewhat relevant
hiphopheads,not_removed,the thing is hhh has a small group of stans of almost every artist and when they make comments at the right time like this guy basically calling budden a legend everyone upvotes him bc they havent heard budden before and just assume hes smart for going against the circlejerk
hiphopheads,not_removed,also implying ll cool j wasnt making music like drake and gambino over twenty years ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,well a lot of the influence that kanye had on hip hop due to was that after that album people were more accepting of dudes showing emotion and breaking the tough guy mold the hip hop community would not have been as ready to accept people like drake cudi and bino without that album i dont believe budden was working with that same sort of subject matter and tone years earlier on his mood muzik series examples of this would style would be black cloud dreamerz and downfall from though that came out after its similar in style to a lot of his earlier work and my personal favorite stuff from him
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek might be below drake in popularity but at least meek is relevant budden is basically entirely irrelevant amongst casual hip hop listeners
hiphopheads,not_removed,like all rappers are besides kendrick though doesnt mean they cant talk shit about drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,no he didnt you fucking idiot edit im tired of seeing so many idiots on this subreddit im not even a budden fan lil b apologized the next day and said it was a joke regardless joe said that he wouldnt have bothered replying to someone like lil b who isnt on his lyrical level you can find several interviews on this matter thats like saying eminem lost because he didnt answer back to the search of bobby fischer
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with a lot of that i feel like its natural to think more highly of dudes that are from your generation of hip hop and therefore people on here tend to dismiss dudes who were big in the earlymid especially see how much shit they have given fat joe on here until atwu and i dont actually expect that much from them im just eternally hopeful that the more heavy posters will try to know as much about hip hop as possible
hiphopheads,not_removed,quality comment you obviously know your hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,yet somehow youre on here talking about him if hes irrelevant then you must be ashamed youre a noname that spends his time on joe budden threads calling him irrelevant lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,you fuck with tax clearly youre the retarded one
hiphopheads,not_removed,so joe is talking shit cus hes romantic with his girl lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe started it again this year cause he dissed him on his podcast and on twitter then meek responded on instagram cause a website lied saying he was gonna release a joe budden diss track
hiphopheads,not_removed,he beat his pregnant girlfriend and forced a miscarriage not exactly killing his kid but still extremely fucked up
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes just sayin joey been here bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah mandem bois in here its calm truss me daddy dunknow we get the whole after u my yute drake the goat did i mention the
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,its ok to cry
hiphopheads,not_removed,cause hes trash
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah this is the type of guy that will now ignore the track buddens just put out even thought it flamed drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,why
hiphopheads,not_removed,it is a joke thats what makes this whole thing hilarious
hiphopheads,not_removed,burn degree ouch
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont be a fanboy its an objective fact lil b destroyed joe budden
hiphopheads,not_removed,alright
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive been listening to hip hop obsessively for over years listened to nearly everything budden has released and in my opinion his content is predominantly just outright boring it all comes down to preference but seriously joeys music is a snoozefest for me why are people downvoting my personal opinion about joe budden are there really people out there that cant accept someone finding his music slightly boring after i listen to a budden tape i dont ever feel like ive gained anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,there is a listening party at a mmg pool party not sure if its officially releasing though
hiphopheads,not_removed,curse you and your common sense if only everyone didnt speak about shit they know nothing about and actually looked into it first
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek basically responded to the rumors he had a budden diss track on by saying he didnt lol i wouldnt call those words
hiphopheads,not_removed,and funnily enough the song that boosted meek really high on all lists is the one with drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah and he only got more popular after the drake beef even if he got demolished popularity it probably goes teir teir cole and kendrick teir mill and maybe big sean obviously not including ogs like jay or kanye
hiphopheads,not_removed,dropping when wasnt it supposed to be christmas
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes put out better music than drake nothing new hes always been better
hiphopheads,not_removed,except when it was posting memes on insta a lot of fucking people on this sub were saying he was ethering meek when he was doing that shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,young black republican
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes insecure he sees beef becoming cool again and wants to get some publicity
hiphopheads,not_removed,so fucking true
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah i gave it an upvote because i agree in thinking that joe would lyrically body meek that being said nobody cares about lyrics anymore just mainstream rankrelevance and that meek has over joe easily
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean sure if you want to call me a stan then go ahead i was more looking at the fact that on this thread the first twenty five comments were all memes about joe budden and meek with no actual hip hop discussion whats annoying is that now on this sub simply liking something thats abnormal is being a stan i dont get it
hiphopheads,not_removed,how was kanye not rapping about the same shit on college dropout and late registration was he talking about shooting people and catching bodies what about talib kweli mos def little brother the roots you can say those people arent relevant and id say theres a chance that joe budden was influenced heavily by talib kwelis quality and blackstar in fact every alternativeundergroundnon battle rapper mc thats come out in the past years owes at least some of their career to talib kweli lets take it back to brand nubian de la soul souls of mischief outkast ll cool j common inspired the fascination with technohousegarage sounds and shitty singing i do like the album itself but the subject matter wasnt much different than anything kanye was rapping about before it was just more sad and melancholy because his mom died and his girl broke up with him but kanye west does not have the patent or trademark on sad hiphop and neither does joe freaking budden and are we gonna pretend that jayz nas dmx jada the lox eminem even tupac dont have plenty of songs that convey emotion those guys have all sold millions of records
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol youre rap geniusing the hell out of this literally just making shit up mood muziks cool it has nothing to do with kanye or there was plenty of stuff like mm before
hiphopheads,not_removed,never heard mood muzik
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not what hes saying hes just breaking down the common argument about budden by giving another more accessible example
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuckers in school telling me always in the barbershop joe budden aint bout this joe budden aint bout that
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,can you not cry directly over my food because its making it too salty
hiphopheads,not_removed,he did tho even if lil bs discography is below average that was a very legitimate diss track no way you can take that from him
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol only time i here of budden is when lil b destroyed him
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao lil b is a fucking joke and a disgrace to the culture i had a friend from high school go off on twitter saying all these new atl kids are trash and if you listen to them you should kill yourself and the dude listens to lil b religiously lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,im gonna refrain from insulting you because im not exactly sure im reading this right to compare budden to eminem is fine they both are overrated but pretty solid to compare evidence to lil b is a joke ev honestly has been one of the premier artists in hip hop now for like years i know sfbf was much before that time but dilated has always been respectable the same cant be said for budden or eminem
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like its natural to think more highly of dudes that are from your generation of hip hop and therefore people on here tend to dismiss dudes who were big in the earlymid especially see how much shit they have given fat joe on here until atwu you arent lying but this doesnt hold up true reallytwo examples a is fabolous i see some people my giving him mad propsrespect and still listen to him i personally still fuck with him heavy i wouldnt put him in my top but top for sure and still think hes an amazing mixtape rapper a few people agree with me but most my age even some hip hop heads dont fuck with him at all and dont even realize hes put out fire mixtapes in the past few years a meh album though and dismiss him as that guy that had a few random hits in the b would be pusha ton one hand you got hip hop heads my age that only know him from grindin then you got people that fuck with him heavy because they realize that hes both an amazing rapper and hugely slept onwheres that divide come in taste its not age im talking about people age like here roughly same age as me but regardless i get what youre saying and mostly agree also idk if you follow complex but theyve got an article thats following the drakejoe budden beef and now the meek milljoe budden beef thats pretty dope and is constantly updated just giving you a heads up honestly cant wait to hear budden wreck meek and hopefully meek claps back with some fire i know theyre both capable ofjoe to a higher extent though id bet on him winning
hiphopheads,not_removed,you obviously know your hip hop saying that shit makes you sound so pretentious fucking hell makes it sound like you think you know so much more so your opinion must be better
hiphopheads,not_removed,wtf tax is hilarious take the stick out of your ass before you listen to him joe budden is the type to say some inappropriate or inflammatory shit and then try to seem intellectually superior and calm as the other party gets upset dude plays with emotions to get what he wants and also smacked up his girlfriend he aint shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe tried explaininf it alot but i jusr couldnt understand his point
hiphopheads,not_removed,it doesnt sound like hes talking shit by saying it was weird to see the guy dressed up but maybe omarakamal just didnt make it sound as insulting
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont forget that that joe tweeted the article and said god is good he is really desperate
hiphopheads,not_removed,what in the fuck what were the consequences
hiphopheads,not_removed,look what you did you fucked around and got the mandem in herewatch out boi nah ting
hiphopheads,not_removed,weak
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant call yourself a true philadelphia hip hop fan without reppin meek
hiphopheads,not_removed,cause joe buddens is desperate pointing out imaginary subliminal disses from drake he even previewed part of a drake diss he was gonna release then now he desperately trying to diss meek on his podcast and twitter lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit meme bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think joe budden is talented but as much as i like some of the mood muzik tapes yeah half of them and thats being generous on a few are filled with tracks ill never ever listen to again when i say yeah mood muzik was dope i mostly mean like songs off of all of them are worth repeating
hiphopheads,not_removed,some high school kid from philly on instagram who somehow always gets this shit right says no later than first week in july
hiphopheads,not_removed,actually the one with nicki was the one that really propelled the album shit got mainstream radio play for like months straight and check
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek mill is not even close to big sean
hiphopheads,not_removed,its really close like in the coming daysweek
hiphopheads,not_removed,think they wanted to release it as an album so it got pushed back and then he got put on house arrest
hiphopheads,not_removed,ya ether is a song and is used to describe what someone did to someone else in a song
hiphopheads,not_removed,money i got coming in
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree that budden is lyrically better than meek but what im saying is that this is just twitter beef at this point and not worth discussing yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,im sorry but i see it too often that whenever a rapper isnt given due respect someone has to come in and not just defend the rapper but try to argue their status as a legend or extreme influence in the game there are many other ways you couldve defended budden besides trying to say he influenced the biggest people in the game and to complain theres no real discussion going on foh do you see what this thread is about just some stupid twitter beef which joe already has plenty of there is nothing of importance to be discussed here go make a guide to the mood musik tapes or stop lying about how important budden is
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah if tshirt and buddens is decent track to you then i really dont know how to respond besides different taste and keep it moving
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre missing out
hiphopheads,not_removed,i realized that as i was writing the comment but i was already too far gone by then
hiphopheads,not_removed,budden stans outchea right now lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shut the fuck up lil b is not a disgrace to the culture
hiphopheads,not_removed,to compare budden to eminem is fine they both are overrated lol youre a fucking moron
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean this comment wasnt any better the point is budden has done more to influence hip hop music than of rappers out right now if you want to say hes irrelevant go ahead i guess doesnt change the fact that if disses actually come out budden will ream meek
hiphopheads,not_removed,usually thats kind of how it works right the more knowledgeable you are the more valuable your inputright
hiphopheads,not_removed,you should at least attempt to know your shit before you call people pretentious for not getting their opinions from twitter
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you say so what i was actually doing is pointing out how little he backed up his shitty low effort comment with actual hip hop knowledge im just tired of how little this sub even tries to know about hip hop music
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah you actually dont know what pretentious means
hiphopheads,not_removed,well then you need to grow up and realize joe budden is far from irrelevant if he wanted to he could pick up the phone right now and phone eminem he has a net worth of a couple of million and realistically he could tour for the next years easily and still make a living from music so it must suck knowing this irrelevant artist has made more money than youll ever see in your lifetime
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought joe was speaking more towards meek changing his style because of nikki as a joe fan i was disappointed joe didnt put out the diss when he first recorded it would have been just before drake and meek got into anything and could of given joe a chance to be recognized again for his ability a lot of people saying this is for publicity and i totally agree but again as a fan im looking forward to this new agressive direction his last few albums were good but im looking forward to just some pure rapping
hiphopheads,not_removed,she didnt press charges and came out with the story after budden made a song about her being a hoe and breaking his heart she provided pictures of her beaten etc
hiphopheads,not_removed,afaik nothing really its mostly her word against his im inclined to believe her though because there are pictures of her bruises its not the only time budden has been accused of beating a woman either
hiphopheads,not_removed,he didnt have a kid my bad i misunderstood httptheboomboxcomjoebuddenrespondstoestherbaxtersaccusationsofabuse and afaik nothing happened it was just accusations but the lady esther baxter got a restraining order on him theres a police report in the link below but she didnt press charges and only gossip sites covered it pictures of the abuse and restraining orderreport no concrete evidence tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,he went to rehab after she stabbed him i know
hiphopheads,not_removed,he isnt contradicting himself hes just hypocritical
hiphopheads,not_removed,rico has more views on both spotify youtube and itunes what are you referring to
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek sold way more first week with dwmtm than big sean did with dsp
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like meeks bigger if anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah sean is more mainstream no doubt
hiphopheads,not_removed,album sales are pretty similar meeks last one probably sold more than dsp at least i remember the first week sales were a good bit higher sean has had hit singles but meek has a pretty big following likely bigger
hiphopheads,not_removed,really i always thought meek was alittle closer to the colekendrick teir he sold alot first week but sean has gotten way bigger with dsp and the mega singles from it i definetly could be wrong about this i dont follow sean heavy like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,ether basically means destroy you can destroy someone on instagram
hiphopheads,not_removed,shut the fuck up with those depressing ass songs its the summertime get some fucking pussy and go home idk how you can hate on that edit also how you go mainstream and run back underground
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not even a budden fan lil b apologized the next day and said it was a joke regardless joe said that he wouldnt have bothered replying to someone like lil b who isnt on his lyrical level you can find several interviews on this matter thats like saying eminem lost because he didnt answer back to the search of bobby fischer
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah youre right hes actually done so much for it
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol you are probably inbred and thus an em stan i dont like budden at all but they are both solid mcs lil b is a joke and ev is one of the better mcs in past years
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol budden could barely ream his own girl
hiphopheads,not_removed,wrong we need more memes and short meaningless comments that add nothing to the discussion
hiphopheads,not_removed,you realise im not the one who called budden irrelevant
hiphopheads,not_removed,eminem is just as irrelevant as joe buddens wack ass
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn thats that mood muzik for you
hiphopheads,not_removed,all eyes on you got a ton of mainstream radio play rico was hot on hip hop radio when the album dropped but seemingly got taken out of the rotation when they started beefing all eyes on you was on the charts for a long long time i think that song carried meeks album to winning the billboard award for best hip hop album of the year i worked in retail at the time and rico was never on the pop station but all eyes on you played at least once a day
hiphopheads,not_removed,didnt sean go platinum tho lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,fr fr
hiphopheads,not_removed,these people conflate album sales way too much tour stats brand size and name recognition are all more important
hiphopheads,not_removed,im talking specifically in this context
hiphopheads,not_removed,but destroy specifically in a rap song
hiphopheads,not_removed,joe budden tv joe bitch tv too hot to touch tybg
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao theres never a middle ground with you niggas when it comes to hip hop is there
hiphopheads,not_removed,the whole im gay album was pretty huge actually
hiphopheads,not_removed,inbred well it takes one to know one
hiphopheads,not_removed,lack of knowledge leads to shitty meme spam which is why most discussion on here is a moot point at best
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow what a shitty fucking meme i guess i should expect that but i wished for better liking a variety of music shouldnt be considered a problem yet people like you who are unable to step out of their comfort zone attempt to make it one to give themselves reason to not expand their taste have fun with your feelings of superiority
hiphopheads,not_removed,you sound lame as fuck yo its a hip hop forum we talk about people that are dead get your stupid ass back on twitter lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,budden wack pick one or dont talk on a subject you know nothing about
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmfao ok buddy thats why youre talking about him on a hip hop forum right now huh
hiphopheads,not_removed,meant to say first week edited
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like meek mill more than big sean but idfwu was bigger than any track in meek mills career not to mention a kanye cosign touring with j cole going platinum on his last album having two top singles and one top feature to meeks none on both counts etc all make him bigger than meek mill
hiphopheads,not_removed,according to who fact is he sold way more copies first week and he was heavily involved in the biggest thing in rap in i bet his name recognition has heavily increased since the drake beef and its definitely not not even close im also pretty sure he went on a pretty big tour last year sold less than ffs fuck outta here with saying meek is not even close to big sean
hiphopheads,not_removed,you said the term ether only applies to songs literally comments ago he proved you wrong and now you are talking about the context
hiphopheads,not_removed,no that isnt only what it means you can use it in a lot of different situations
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck it lets all just shitpost
hiphopheads,not_removed,i guess hes not wack if you like listening to a suicidal fake ass motherfucker mope about his emotions
hiphopheads,not_removed,doesnt make them relevant if theyre talked about once a year
hiphopheads,not_removed,why would i be talking about real ether of course im talking about how its used in rap
hiphopheads,not_removed,then what are you memeing at the dude for
hiphopheads,not_removed,guess its not whack if you know the first thing about rap and rapping no matter what the dude is rapping about
hiphopheads,not_removed,and he was talking about how you can ether someone without making a song the context is very clear in this situation
hiphopheads,not_removed,grew up with xavier this slaps and im telling you he aint bullshitting about what he says
hiphopheads,not_removed,so even tho he watches anime he rlly will cripple me
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol right i have nothing but good things to say about him he really doesnt give a fuck what anyone thinks about him never been afraid to be different
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao you can make anything sound like a pressure washer doing that shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not really a fan of this guys voice bc of the auto tuning but hes got some top notch producers on this tape w metro southside sonny digital ricky racks etc
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant get past the first song
hiphopheads,not_removed,agreed but his melodies are solid the production is what makes this a solid mixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,xanax version of turk jd lol peep and tracy have incredible chemistry
hiphopheads,not_removed,emo white niggas infiltrating hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,lyrics are so catchy i wanted to ignore the thread but peep presented himself again as a hitmaker
hiphopheads,not_removed,castles ii still my favorite hiphop project of the year also im really hoping that lil tracy is the mutual link to get famous dex and lil peep on the same track
hiphopheads,not_removed,peeps a bit late on that bones aesthetic
hiphopheads,not_removed,peep is ehhh i liked tracy a lot more when he was yung bruh but tracys manga was pretty solid
hiphopheads,not_removed,great song lame video wish peep would put out better video content to match his music
hiphopheads,not_removed,when did brokencyde sans screaming become cool this shit sounds like a two and a half minute fftl breakdown this shit is not good in either genre that its trying to crossover from also real talk neither of these wings have ever done a true summoning so they can suck my dick forreal what the fuck is this though
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly surprised their brains are still functioning at this point so much drugs
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil peep trash
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao this is pure trash
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres no way im taking gothboyclique seriously
hiphopheads,not_removed,yikes
hiphopheads,not_removed,trash dont me
hiphopheads,not_removed,amazing analogy castles ii is fire normally cant stand tracy solo but his work with peep is awesome
hiphopheads,not_removed,just emos in general
hiphopheads,not_removed,bones did popularize this but i dont think hes late if anything hes timed it just right gbc continuing this wave big
hiphopheads,not_removed,the girls video fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,agreed like the vibes n shit but they didnt really nail the aesthetics i see they were going for
hiphopheads,not_removed,this video was fire something different from high quality produced videos that we always see
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah
hiphopheads,not_removed,you sound like an old fucker why so mad bro game is always changing you dont need to like it but if you dont see some quality in this then you a dumb ho yo
hiphopheads,not_removed,did somebody really just mention from first to last breakdowns on hhh never thought id see the day
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea man its honestly sad im a huge fan of peep but hearing him talk is embarassing
hiphopheads,not_removed,way to talk down someone whos way more successful than you i dont even like lil peep i just hate your attitude
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,false my nig
hiphopheads,not_removed,look at all of old futures old fans dick riding rn
hiphopheads,not_removed,its sad how hhh just gives pass to any hip hop artist especially this clown
hiphopheads,not_removed,gayboiclique might be up your alley then
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil yachty cool tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,tracy solo is hit or miss tracys manga is fire tho but he always comes with heat when hes with peep
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah thats actually my reference point lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,at least someone likes it
hiphopheads,not_removed,good comment
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think his point was that brokencyde was awful and these dudes are using the same awful style taking a steaming pile of shit and trying to transform it into something else doesnt make a difference its still a hot steaming pile of shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,dae skrillex is sonny moore
hiphopheads,not_removed,in what way im never heard him talk
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not talking him down ive been in the same place doing too many drugs i have friends in his circle that tell me how bad hes doing now its just sad and im hoping his lifestyle changes soon or he might do something stupid or end up ruining his career
hiphopheads,not_removed,of course you just gonna suck up everything that comes up on soundcloud
hiphopheads,not_removed,im surprised to be honest hhh usually shits on artists outside of the mainstream im far from an oldhead but damn this is cringe only thing thats decent is the beat
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn you better get to class
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wish i could enjoy tracys manga but it is just so bad love emo tracy though
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah he was a fucking asshole when he was in fftl too almost got into a fight with him at a show once i used to fuck with some of their songs until that left a bad taste in my mouth
hiphopheads,not_removed,it just caught me offguard because the demographic of this sub generally seems pretty young and fftl started blowing up in like and sonny moore left in like so a lot of people here would have been super young at that time i didnt know fftl kept making music after sonny left the band so i guess thats why i was so surprised
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmtiazyrhodk mans slurs like hes brain dead
hiphopheads,not_removed,how bad is he doing
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck outta here lil peep is dope i dont even use sound cloud to find music stop hatig
hiphopheads,not_removed,its so good tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait hollup alone makes tracys manga a good tape lol howd you not like it the tape was so lil tracy
hiphopheads,not_removed,full on drug addict partying nearly every night
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah hes just a copy of a copy of a copy of a remember bones n uicideboy and a big minus he looks like a clown but if u enjoy go for it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i remember a year ago suicideboys and that type of stuff was getting shit on all the time here
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk i keep hearing good things and i like tracy with peep but i guess him solo just doesnt do it for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,what drugs tho i assumed he was partying almost every night as thats not out of the ordinary for a popular artist living in la lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know this an old thread lol but im getting more into tracy and was looking through his posts funny im the opposite i really like tracy solo and really dont like peep solo but i like peep with tracy
hiphopheads,not_removed,coke xanax lean heroin etc
hiphopheads,not_removed,i fuck with solo tracy now surprisingly he grew on me
hiphopheads,not_removed,why u think he does h im sure he does oxy n lean but idk about h
hiphopheads,not_removed,because ive seen him and his circle do h lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit for real where the fuck did u see that lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,im hoping for either a premiere of a new song off the album or for kanye to come out and perform his part in that part
hiphopheads,not_removed,is colbert secretly top kendrick an q on his show this cant just be a coincidence
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would love to hear q say you can fuck my bitch you can have my hoe on live tv
hiphopheads,not_removed,interesting to see if he pulls a kendrick and performs a song only meant for a live audience
hiphopheads,not_removed,guess which late night talk show im watching tonight
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok ok ok ok
hiphopheads,not_removed,conan
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay okay okay okay okay okay
hiphopheads,not_removed,they chained us to the auction blocks but we changin the locks even bill oreillys daughter out here drinkin ciroc damn
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn thats tight is he going to drop an album anytime soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,mensa unchained
hiphopheads,not_removed,god damn vic this shit is great
hiphopheads,not_removed,im really fucking hyped for his fucking album man
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn this is amazing between this and the new soul what a damn good night for hiphop
hiphopheads,not_removed,no lie i hear the hov influence in this one would fit in black album vic is versatile af
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive never fucked with vic but this is actually surprisingly good
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn vic killed this shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,his album honestly might be my most anticipated for the rest of the year
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive never listened to vic mensa at all but that shit was true
hiphopheads,not_removed,vic wayyy betta than chance
hiphopheads,not_removed,hot damn this is amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,loving the song but does it sound a bit too busy for anyone else its kind of hard to actually hear vic over everything
hiphopheads,not_removed,just listened to the entire birth of a nation soundtrack on spotify amazing fox threw a lot of money into this project
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuuuuuuck that was crazy good first verse gave me goosebumps
hiphopheads,not_removed,just listened to it on apple music and the mixingmastering sounds a lot better either that or its just the higher quality audio
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is dope but the mixing is fucked his voice needs to be way louder
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit this song ive been living under a rock lately but damn this song was fire definitely gonna check out his older music now
hiphopheads,not_removed,slaps
hiphopheads,not_removed,nice
hiphopheads,not_removed,lit
hiphopheads,not_removed,does it sound like it would be off of theres alot going on because thats project of the year for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy fuck this is the best track ive heard in a while i just keep replaying it i cant even concentrate on my work when im listening to it i just close my eyes and listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,i need this on spotify
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn both vic and soul actually dropped some good shit hope they stay consistent cause these songs are dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,this whole soundtrack is really really good so far god damn
hiphopheads,not_removed,lyrics aside this sounds like an eminem mountain dew anthem too corny
hiphopheads,not_removed,its alright sometimes i think vic tries to hard though like him and kendrick have similar themes in their music but if kendrick is like mlk level of activist vic mensa is buzzfed song is decent though just not something i see myself playing multiple times
hiphopheads,not_removed,man i love vic but i dont even know how i feel about what hes saying though fact is that if you get a normal looking black dude walking down the street aint no one gonna give him a second look but if you sag your pants have tattoos all over you body do drugs and all no shit youre gonna get a second look on the street not only if youre black but if youre a white dude dressed like that too im a brown dude btw
hiphopheads,not_removed,nowadays rap turns to more social thing the chaos happenin in the world especially with color people in america its awful errbody sick of it
hiphopheads,not_removed,god he is so boring dont get the hype for this guy at all theres jusy nothing original coming out of him all the topics he chooses to cover have already been covered with more tact and expertise vic feels played out and hes only just started
hiphopheads,not_removed,white america fuck bill oriley
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah it should be out hopefully by the end of the year if not then the start of he said like a month ago it was around done
hiphopheads,not_removed,now that i remember he said he scrapped his album but was almost done his new one a while back
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont sleep on dave east homie
hiphopheads,not_removed,my ears are cumming
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude dont sleep on theres a lot going on he released it this year and is an insane mixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,glad u woke up
hiphopheads,not_removed,i recommend listening to his ep theres a lot going on that came out this year never listened to vic before that and it blew me away one of my fave projects this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,check out theres a lot going on like that other guy said that shits heavy if you want something a bit less dark and in my opinion better check out innanetape one of my favorite tapes
hiphopheads,not_removed,the background vocals obscure his voice a little bit which is tough since its such a lyrical piece but its not that bad i definitely see what youre saying though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i found it was part backing vocals but the bass was really intense try turning down your bass a little bit if youre on a computer that may help his lyrics come out a bit still really great song that was my only complaint as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,try listening to it here the mixingmastering was off in the original link i posted
hiphopheads,not_removed,this youtube channel doesnt seem legit its got some other videos that are clearly getting around the content management system
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a leak pirate upload check on your streaming or online store to get the legit version
hiphopheads,not_removed,id check out his most recent ep theres alot going on then go back to his mixtape innanetape also he used to be in a band called kids these days they released a dope raprockjazz album called traphouse rock if you enjoy all of that check out
hiphopheads,not_removed,it definitely does conscious lyrics heavy beat and pretty dark i fuckin love it
hiphopheads,not_removed,deleted
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait what when does he talk about sagging pants tattoos etc in this song
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay lets just say what youre saying is true its not but lets say it is for the sake of the argument what gives you the right to define what normal is how does having tats and wearing jeans the way you like them make you not normal people should be able to express themselves however they want to as long as it isnt hurting anyone else i dont see the problem and neither should police officers
hiphopheads,not_removed,yall complain that nobody with a poppy sound is rapping about anything real and vic is over here dropping one of the most socially conscious projects of the year and every song sounds amazing but hes played out please
hiphopheads,not_removed,didnt he also say he scrapped it or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait he dropped his album
hiphopheads,not_removed,link
hiphopheads,not_removed,my ears havent even gotten a fucking nut off yet my ears have been precumming for the last eight years my ears havent even ejaculated a full spew yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,raesremmuc
hiphopheads,not_removed,did you listened to inanetape its pretty dope too
hiphopheads,not_removed,why the fuck are the comments so racist in this one
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh yeah for sure it was uploaded yesterday before the album officially came out
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks bro yeah sounds like he mentioned the band in that track definitely gonna check out that mix tape thanks again
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you brother
hiphopheads,not_removed,how does having tats and wearing jeans the way you like them make you not normal because most of the people who commit crimes are dressed like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,traffic got scrapped i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh fuck sorry i thought he meant the movies album ima just delete that comment so it doesnt mislead people
hiphopheads,not_removed,might want to take this down cuz it aint a free project but i got the spotify link
hiphopheads,not_removed,calm down cudi
hiphopheads,not_removed,no problem
hiphopheads,not_removed,the fact that you two have swiftie avatars makes this exchange regarding spotify kind of hilarious to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,so how does that make you not normal
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep traffic got scrapped but im pretty sure hes still planning on keeping a couple songs from it on the new album
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol gotcha i got really excited for a second
hiphopheads,not_removed,link wasnt referring to a leak imo if the mods ban him thats bull
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just imaging the tswizzle face is her reaction to anything i post makes me feel like an edgy teen again
hiphopheads,not_removed,the dickriding in this sub crazy its not normal because thats not how most peiple dress its not normal because thats how most criminaps dress nothing wrong with sagging pants and having tatoos whatsoever all im saying is that white guys like that would get a second look if they looked like that too reason im saying this is because vic mentions how people still look at black people on the street sorta like there scared and shit im saying its no because of skin color but because of attire
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope i aint trippin is on it or at least he just drops it as a loosie
hiphopheads,not_removed,i read in an article a few months back he had a song sampling a weezer song from pinkerton sent it to rivers cuomo and he actually liked it so much that he recorded backing vocals for the song i really really hope he didnt scrap that one
hiphopheads,not_removed,fr i just assume everything has an apple or spotify link nowadays i never understood dudes begging for a pirate link either how hard is it to google
hiphopheads,not_removed,not gonna ban him dw context is p important if its on all streaming services nobodys gonna ask for a illegal download
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah man id be really surprised if it did just because of how old it is but i still listen to that live performance rip like every day so damn good
hiphopheads,not_removed,about how hard it is to get a virus downloading albums off sketchy websites
hiphopheads,not_removed,real shit from what i know places like kat and tpb have fallen and i dont know why other reputable ones so enlighten me
hiphopheads,not_removed,ad blockers are insanely useful
hiphopheads,not_removed,piratebay still works fine for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,im more into the alternative side of hip hop but a lot of old heads liked this old track i made back when i was more into shit httpssoundcloudcomsilkanimussoverycold
hiphopheads,not_removed,download them on a computer and transfer them to your phone otherwise imo livemixtapes is the best
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like using hotnewhiphopcom so id say use that
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes i believe you can
hiphopheads,not_removed,yup
hiphopheads,not_removed,can we stop with the x posts
hiphopheads,not_removed,boy you like a week late
hiphopheads,not_removed,y tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,after perusing through the comments i guess his promoters cut his time short so he said fuck this and left if true i dont blame him sucks for everyone involved though love jeremih
hiphopheads,not_removed,jeremih should be more popular than he is the best rb artist out imo late nights was one of the best albums of imo and oui and pass dat were two of my top songs of
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was there last night ive seen jeremih times in chicago of those times he showed up extremely late played a few songs then threw a tantrum when his set was cut short the only time this didnt happen was at his own record release show at double door and it was an amazing show i love his music but the dude is such a prima donna steady fucking over his hometown fans
hiphopheads,not_removed,man kanye is really that influential
hiphopheads,not_removed,i heard that he got on stage late because he was throwing a fit about wanting to headline the show since he was in his hometown except he didnt tell anyone that until minutes before the show he threatened to drop out of the rest of the tour with pnd his set was cut short because this was an all ages show and there was a curfew
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn this was in chicago too thats rough
hiphopheads,not_removed,is this a trend right now lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok off thanks everybody for appreciating jeremih in here though while im thinking about underappreciated rb singers what ever happened to lloyd feels like he fell off the map super fast a few years ago he had one of my favorite voices in rbhiphop httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdixlsmtekam he released a this year prod justice league too but nobody really cared at all just saying
hiphopheads,not_removed,if he was throwing a fit good this is why i only go to legit venues for hip hop shows now why you ask the first show i ever went to was in to a waka show in a suspect part of okc ie hood the venue was shady af and there was a lot of red there if you catch my drift i went by myself and got there at it was like and waka still hadnt got on stage i had to work the next day so i left i paid to goi was pissed he got there ass late to and just hung in vip ive since seen him like more times and its been solid ever sinceits also been in places where they actually have touring people at all the time tldr venues have these rules so you cant be a divaetc get the people in play your shit and get out at a reasonable time tybg
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was there and it was disappointing as fuck i love partynextdoor but his live shows are subpar compared to his first two albums fuck he said on twitter they cut his set short but i heard the same thing happened at ahhfest this summer idk i kinda want my money back it was a shitty experience for it being my first time seeing both
hiphopheads,not_removed,anyone there was lucky too see him i was at the detroit show and he didnt even come on stage as we were getting into the venue they announced he canceled my girlfriend and her friend were pretty disappointed but party put on a good show so her and i loved it
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,throwing shade in the shade room
hiphopheads,not_removed,smh everyone biting ye
hiphopheads,not_removed,jeremih is by far the most talented rnb vocalist in the game his range is unprecedented not even worth it to talk about second place i guess bryson tiller would be second place
hiphopheads,not_removed,apparently the show runners cut his set short he was talking to them not the audience
hiphopheads,not_removed,sounds like nobody was vibin with him
hiphopheads,not_removed,sounds like this one is actually his fault
hiphopheads,not_removed,his label fucked up his promotion
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah im with you on that one
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not really feeling late nights europe but late nights the album is so good still listen to it regularly
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes just oh yeah the dont tell em guy hes still around to a bunch of people
hiphopheads,not_removed,you sleeping on miguel bruh wildheart was dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,completely agree man
hiphopheads,not_removed,late nights is high quality radio rb
hiphopheads,not_removed,if the only place to discuss rnb music is a hip hop forum what does it matter if youre the best rnb artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont even like listen to rb music and i feel this way aswell his album from was incredible i heard iou and couldnt understand why it only had views on youtube even after the album had dropped it wasnt until months later that it got radio play what the fuck is def jam doing for this guy i want him on roc nation
hiphopheads,not_removed,i completely disagree that jeremih even sniffs the top of the list as best current rb artists he has a few catchy hooks and utilizes pretty trendy beats but his singing chops just arent up to snuff httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcsbnkazutlq is a perfect example of the type of artist jeremih is he sings like a third of the song because he doesnt have the natural talent to put on a good performance this live video aligns perfectly with my experience when i saw him perform
hiphopheads,not_removed,late nights europe wasnt quite as good but yeah overall im with you he and bryson tiller are the rnb dudes to watch imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,most of his songs sound very similar he doesnt really explore much just tends to stick to the same recipe for every song not a bad thing but makes it hard to listen to a lot of him without feeling like youre just listening to the same thing on repeat
hiphopheads,not_removed,paradise is one of the greatest songs ive ever heard tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,what happened to his collab with pnd
hiphopheads,not_removed,uh are you being sarcastic he played at my schools fall concert last year or one of the concerts in the past year and was complete trash not only was the music generic and boring and just all around terrible but also he lip synced the entire thing on a small quad with like people at most and the dj played air horns at the beginning and end of every single song for the entire show no misses oui was decent and he had that one hit best rb artist out youre comparing to frank ocean anderson paak drake arguable dangelo and even kendrick with tpab in yeah you must be trippin to say this generic shitty guy with a squeaky voice and complete lack of ability to perform is the best artist of any genre right now let alone one with current legends ill give late nights a spin tho perhaps its better than what he released before
hiphopheads,not_removed,i always thought the phrase was premadonna not prima donna lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit do you think he left because he thought his own chicago fans were leaving thats pretty funny actually
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks lloyd
hiphopheads,not_removed,it is the best venue in chicago if you ask me if youre ever in town go to aragon ballroom its dope af
hiphopheads,not_removed,this was at a pretty legit venue fyi
hiphopheads,not_removed,its kinda ok though because i got back at them by gunning cigs in the bathroom because there was no reentry just doing my part to fight the man
hiphopheads,not_removed,bryson tiller second the weeknd frank ocean miguel literally any other rb singer
hiphopheads,not_removed,so is it jeremee or jeremai
hiphopheads,not_removed,wym you can clearly hear the singing in the vid
hiphopheads,not_removed,r u dense
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont tell em planes and oui did well tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao they did not jeremiah was notorious at the label for not showing up to shit even didnt show up to shoot his own video his lack of promotion is because of him not in spite of him
hiphopheads,not_removed,his attitude doesnt help things
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think hes partly responsible due to his own issues alcoholism but im not sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was a little bit on both sides jeremih pushe dout his first album with def jam and he had already recorded it so he just needed a label to drop it withbig succes with birthday sex he went on a frank ocean hiatus for albums and didnt drop anything almost years later also on august jeremih released a mixtape called noma not on my album to show all the songs he recorded that werent going to be on the album one song on the mixtape called cant go no mo featuring juicy j was originally meant to be on the track list of late nights in an interview with billboard jeremih explains how his personal issues is the reason for the album delays he says i blame myself i had a video scheduled i just didnt show up to it because of he started choosing not to finish his thought im not going to point my finger at somebody else at this point jeremih then pointed to some personal troubles he was having with the mother of his child i stopped caring about being jeremih over the last few months he said a lot of people dont know i have a twoyearold son his mom wasnt allowing me to see him and it was messing with me i was internally unbalanced but i just got out of that trial and i won jeremih also expressed some frustration with his label def jam is hesitating and not being on my side he explained i see other artists and how theyre supported its hard when im on a roster with rihanna rick ross and kanye west on may in a separate interview with billboard producer and frequent jeremih collaborator mick schultz confirmed that the originally released track listing and album artwork had been changed and was no longer accurate on november the official album art release date and track list was leaked by music streaming service deezer the following day snippets of the album were leaked to the internet that leak prolly pissed off the label and tey just said fuck it and dropped it with no promotion and with higher priced so no one buys it
hiphopheads,not_removed,late nights with jeremih mixtape that came out before late nights is really great as well prefer both of those to late nights europe
hiphopheads,not_removed,while theyre both fantastic wild heart is much better and even though it was super late black messiah is still far above both of them and due to its late release many put it in top of records
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol you dont even listen to rb but agree that jeremih is the best rb singer out huh
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont sleep on wildheart and black messiah dude youre missing out
hiphopheads,not_removed,he said specifically that its a new song at the start thats usually code for i havent rehearsed this shit so its not gonna be the normal level of performance you can see him perform all of planez on the same festival
hiphopheads,not_removed,kendrick is not an rb artist lmao tpab is more jazz influenced than rb
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wouldnt know without vince staples
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah from the sound of it he was just pissed his set got cut short and bailed out however it got cut short bc of curfewswhich kinda played into what i was describingmaking sure the show gets out at a reasonable time it sucks but it helps everyonekids and
hiphopheads,not_removed,their music might be better i was talking strictly about vocals what jeremih does with his voice his range is unparalleled he croons and spits and everything in between sounds like different people bryson tiller does that too to a certain extent miguel frank ocean but he has rapped before and the weeknd dont
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty sure its the latter
hiphopheads,not_removed,jerome
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think jeremee is one of the possibilities its jeremihh or jeremai
hiphopheads,not_removed,jerimeh
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think it might be jar ee moi
hiphopheads,not_removed,the guy who types r u calling others dense lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont tell em came out months before his album dropped they botched a crazy hot single edit apparently it was actually at least months lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,and why his album was priced at
hiphopheads,not_removed,fucking a higher ups wife apparently
hiphopheads,not_removed,those artists arent even in the same league as dangelo practically no one is
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a sure sign that jeremih is the best
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe he agreed with that late nights was underrated and that jeremih should be more popular
hiphopheads,not_removed,that his album was one of the best of clown yourself kid
hiphopheads,not_removed,i specifically said that some of tpab is rampb influenced not that he is an rb artist overall or that the entire thing was wesleys theory these walls complexion and you aint gotta lie and king kunta i would all definitely call rampb influenced as well as the original version of i of course
hiphopheads,not_removed,jerahmy
hiphopheads,not_removed,im just gonna keep pronouncing it like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,the guy that rides his high horse who uses lol rather than laughing out loud
hiphopheads,not_removed,i swore dont tell em was like a year before the album dropped
hiphopheads,not_removed,source
hiphopheads,not_removed,thatll do it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i did skim
hiphopheads,not_removed,in what way is king kunta rb influenced wtf lol its funkjazz
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,here for back up
hiphopheads,not_removed,it certainly felt that way according to wiki it dropped in june and the album december
hiphopheads,not_removed,like in the song people are literally screaming we want the funk
hiphopheads,not_removed,um im not sure what pure jazz youve been listening to but ive personally never heard anything even remotely resembling king kunta in jazz rampb is often the fusion of percussive funk and jazz sounds and influence but king kunta is very light on the jazz influence as far as tpab goes im not sure how you can listen to that boom bap funk drum beat and not think funkrampb especially with the background singers saying we want the funk and a distinctly funk bassline you thinking of a different song you are objectively wrong but id like to think you had it mixed it up rather than claiming you dont know what funk or jazz are edit i see you said funkjazz ok but like i said its barely got any jazz influence and the small amount it does have is enough to classify it as rb with funkjazz fusion
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe as a single to the album it dropped in as a regular single i think this youtube video is from may of holy shit heres the wiki january of for an album that dropped in december of
hiphopheads,not_removed,funk then if you prefer its not rb you are objectively wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,jesus its even worse edit hey im a dummy wiki said june all along album was december
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo fuck this shit get it off the sub nobody wants to fucking follow your facebook page i see you guys spamming it all over fb and now youre doing it here too
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmaooo bro stfu no one gives a fuck about ur stupid ass fb group u guys needa spam to get anybody to even join fucking sad fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,this documentary is narrated by zane lowe and features many artists and musicians it releases dec and comes out exclusively on apple music
hiphopheads,not_removed,woah this looks sick
hiphopheads,not_removed,i posted this the first time and its been posted here like times now lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh this got posted like times in the last couple years i stg ive seen this
hiphopheads,not_removed,ik cant wait
hiphopheads,not_removed,ur not the first person to mention it this is a release trailer so its finally releasing so lets be happy about that now
hiphopheads,not_removed,prove it link me
hiphopheads,not_removed,no like i posted this exact release trailer days ago or whenever when it came out the one now is just a shorter version and not posted by apple
hiphopheads,not_removed,its lowkey the same thing httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlisowqy
hiphopheads,not_removed,ik i just saw ur updated post but i didnt know so lets relish in the fact more people will know now and its only a couple days away
hiphopheads,not_removed,it is the same thing just it wasnt released until now prob apple music bought the distribution rights for it since it said by ur link it was gonna come out in but probably never actually released so apple music bought and are going to exclusively release on their app
hiphopheads,not_removed,havent listened yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,if this is what is to be expected from abs next project i am looking forward to it the beat is filth
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty excited to hear this despite ovo having a relatively uniform sound roy stands out to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,this kid is so talented cant wait
hiphopheads,not_removed,roy wood is my favorite new rb artist so this is hugely exciting
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just want that snippet he has with playboi carti to release badly
hiphopheads,not_removed,this shit blindsided me like a motherfucker on my tl i was expecting it probably mid july but now im hype
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,just getting into woods as im going to drake in september and hell be there and he is hugely dope very much anticipating tomorrow
hiphopheads,not_removed,really looking forward to this the tone of his voice fits the spacey ovo sound so well its such a shame though how yet again an ovo project gets little promotion
hiphopheads,not_removed,may i politely ask why my post last night got taken off
hiphopheads,not_removed,better not be an apple exclusive
hiphopheads,not_removed,is this an ep or album
hiphopheads,not_removed,this dude reminds me so much of the old mixtape presuperfame weeknd i feel like ill be giving this album more than a couple spins exis ep is still in rotation
hiphopheads,not_removed,link
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably will be considering how much drake and ovo sound is affiliated with apple
hiphopheads,not_removed,album
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shiiit
hiphopheads,not_removed,my second attempt at adding desiigners adlibs to a song previously did party pack by future im not exclusive to adding desiigners adlibs to future songs but someone requested i do it on low life i have no background in music i just desiigners adlibs could make every song better so im doing it because there is nothing like it right now if you have any suggestions or want a song mixed comment what song below also its hard as hell to find perfect desiigner adlibs this nigga aint got no package you can download for his adlibs lol i have to find a song with his adlibs with little to no background noise when he does them so i can strip that audio and add it subliminally into a different song so basically i only have like to work with because an adlib on a different song also has that songs beat so when you mix that with some new shit you get some weird noises if you want to recommend any songs for me to pull adlibs from where theres virtually no background noise then let me know
hiphopheads,not_removed,every song needs desiigner adlibs
hiphopheads,not_removed,brooo this is goat ahaha i feel like desiigner adlibs would go perfect on all day by ye
hiphopheads,not_removed,can you do mase in
hiphopheads,not_removed,my exact thoughts
hiphopheads,not_removed,second this
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a huge lil yachty fan and somehow never knew of this song regardless adlibs work really well right after the artist says something and theres a short pause for a few miliseconds this song is so rapid idk how i could do it but ima attempt it if it comes out good ill reply w a link
hiphopheads,not_removed,that version of the jetsons movie has been canned and they restarted with a new writer and screenplay
hiphopheads,not_removed,is kanye still involved
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably no
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn i wish he was i know hes a huge fan of the show
hiphopheads,not_removed,this sub must be sleepin on skyzoo if after hours its only at
hiphopheads,not_removed,mmg mello music group is my favorite hip hop record label theyve got so many great acts look forward to listening to this
hiphopheads,not_removed,skyzoo has always been an incredible rapper and its so great to see him paired up with a producer like apollo cant wait to listen to this through songs in and im loving what im hearing
hiphopheads,not_removed,man skyzoo thats one rapper where it takes time to digest his lyrics because he got so much meaning complexity and just some good bars in them he has a large catalog by now with some good collabos like this one torae marco polo and illmind apollo brownsheesh dude is an amazing producer and his catalog is also crazy i really hope he breaks his idea again with working with the same artist for a second lp just like he did with the ugly heroes because id would love to hear another skzyoo and apollo brown lp
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont sleep on this album
hiphopheads,not_removed,apollo brown is the shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck this gonna be a perfect fall album as it gets colder out here
hiphopheads,not_removed,really liking this album so far the vibes is crazy good
hiphopheads,not_removed,cannot wait to listen to this singles have been on point
hiphopheads,not_removed,these two play to each others strengths so well and basquiat on the draw and on the stretch bob show are two of my top songs of the year hands down
hiphopheads,not_removed,listening to this now its everything i wanted great lyrics and rapping over apollo brown beats
hiphopheads,not_removed,one in the same is haunting apollo never disappoints when it comes to his beats
hiphopheads,not_removed,great album well worth the wait after first listening to the vibes i knew this was going to be a dope project
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre sleeping on apollo brown by only mentioning him in your comment
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not kanye or chance so this sub doesnt care
hiphopheads,not_removed,this sub is sleeping period this is apollo brown and motherfucking skyzoo releasing a whole project together this is hip hop but the few dope hip hop albums that come out and are long anticipated in the hip hop world generally go unnoticed on hhh i just write it off as people here being very young also can just i say that this shit is just as good as i had hoped for that rarely happens these days the singles had me thinking that it would go in a completely different direction they were dope but wasnt madly in love with any of them but it turned out to be amazing pretty much all the tracks are good
hiphopheads,not_removed,agreed so much talent and so many different styles
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre having a sale right now too
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck yes i already know now that this album will be the soundtrack for the winterfall of also this is a stupid good album release of the year for me easily
hiphopheads,not_removed,if people here dont know skyzoo they certainly dont know apollo brown
hiphopheads,not_removed,you forgot desiigner uzi vert yachty and drake lol for people being hip hop heads ive never seen a group of people so onedimensional
hiphopheads,not_removed,id wager that many more people know apollo brown than skyzoo actually
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive mentioned it before there needs to be a new sub reddit for real hiphop grown man rap this is a dope project yet all the top threads are about frank weeknd kanye and kim kardashian
hiphopheads,not_removed,ur acting like its a surprise that hip hop fans are interested in the biggest names in hip hop obviously those guys get attention because theyre popular lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,because the sub is called hiphopheads not onlywhatspopularhiphop
hiphopheads,not_removed,and since when do we have a lack of content from what typical heads like we have everything here idk what underground or rapper is absent here but that every hip hop head knows
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre really gonna go to the reading comprehension type come back lol youre assuming everyone in this sub is a hip hop head just because its the name of our sub theres plenty of hip hop heads here but because this is a more diverse place with subscribers popular guys will get more attention naturally
hiphopheads,not_removed,the discussion is over people completely ignoring good music just because they havent heard of an artist before and only going over whats popular not lack of variety which there really is
hiphopheads,not_removed,fake compilation of leaked records illegally uploaded to itunes smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,mins no comment the fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,is that what happened i cant find info about this anywhere do you have any links to check it out
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit that song was dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,song was dope as hell but he was real life about to cry lol tf id reccommend watching the whole video the other two artists well one was a group were good as well creative stuff edit spiritual experience with dance music in francedid she just do e or
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpssoundcloudcommaggierogers
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo no lie i went to middle school with her actually played in the same section together in the middle school band nbdamazing talented human being shes definitely going places the song is tight as hell too everyone from our town flipped when they saw this video p gave her so much love for the song
hiphopheads,not_removed,alright so who got this synesthesia condition besides frank kanye and pharrell seems like a blessing for creative people
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was an awesome clip it reminds me of the listening booth scene from before sunrise
hiphopheads,not_removed,i need that song in my life
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was incredible you could tell how nervous she looked at the beginning showing her own song to this musical legend and as the video went on you could see her just getting into it and i loved it song reminds me of lana del rey mostly her voice and dreamy style but this was seriously so cool to watch
hiphopheads,not_removed,man if i was showing him my music i would be so uncomfortable whenever i show anybody any of my music i have to be like this part isnt very good i gotta rerecord that vocal or this guitar part was improvised so it kinda sucks i hate being in the same room when i show somebody my shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn that song is awesome
hiphopheads,not_removed,that is the best song ive ever heard as of late wow
hiphopheads,not_removed,lock maggie up on a studio right now give her a banjo and some baguettes the world needs more of that music
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hit her up on facebook cdq is coming out soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean hey man thats why hes him i genuinely believe pharrell cares more about music than ill ever care about anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,i went on a pharrell youtube binge after this vid and thats true for sure i saw the othertone interview with aziz ansari and dj khaled and man pharrell really feels uncomfortable when other people talk about how amazing and great he is or if he has to do so about himself
hiphopheads,not_removed,does anyone know the name of the song she shared
hiphopheads,not_removed,this songs amazing no lie i want cdq
hiphopheads,not_removed,i instantly thought thats a hit when i heard it
hiphopheads,not_removed,id like to know too seems interesting that they share this condition
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty sure tyler claims to have it as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think its definitely a blessing but a lot of up and coming rappers like to claim they have it not saying they dont but i think they see ye and all these other big names say they have it and it seems cool to say you do
hiphopheads,not_removed,am i the only person who thinks theyre lying about it i dunno i always figured kanye was lying about it because he tends to talk about it when he goes on his crazy rants
hiphopheads,not_removed,tyler and mary j blige have it as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,vladimir nabokov man but he wasnt a musician though haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,vladimir nabokov man but he wasnt a musician though haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,what a beautiful scene imma go watch it now
hiphopheads,not_removed,goat romance movie in my opinion no exaggeration
hiphopheads,not_removed,can i hear some of your music
hiphopheads,not_removed,how is it generic its not like ive never heard anything like it but its certainly not popular or very common and ive rarely heard it executed as well as she did
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a pop music song so i guess that could be labeled as generic music by some its just that you could definitely hear her folk influence on it which gave it that different sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,alaska according to spotify
hiphopheads,not_removed,the cdq is out the song came up out of nowhere in the new music friday playlist on spotify its called alaska by maggie rogers
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think it may be a big help for successful artists for example david hockney has it and uses it when designing ballet stage sets also ironically apparently stevie wonder has it too
hiphopheads,not_removed,first movie that made me cry
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dunno if youre joking or not but youve given me an opening to promote myself so im gonna do it httpssoundcloudcomtomtheticklemonster im working on an album or something right now and itll be my first proper project so theres like two finished songs on my soundcloud surrounded by a bunch of covers instrumentals and meme rap beats heres the finished songs httpssoundcloudcomtomtheticklemonsterprettypicture httpssoundcloudcomtomtheticklemonstersomethingbeautifulandreal all the shit ive written over the past few months is sorta indie folk type shit tho so those songs arent that close to what im gonna be doing also if you scroll to the bottom youll get to hear the metal songs that my band wrote when we were all years old so youll at least get a good laugh out of my music you think all my other stuff is trash
hiphopheads,not_removed,give her credit its more than just a pop song
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo please link this im a huge kanye stan but when he started taking about synesthesia on the ellen show it seemed like a term he had just heard about and he kind of applied it to his creative process
hiphopheads,not_removed,serious contender tho that trilogy is something else
hiphopheads,not_removed,people dont say no exaggeration unless theyre exaggerating
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah like kanye shotsfired
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wasnt joking also i really fuck with something beautiful
hiphopheads,not_removed,not taking any credit away i think its a really good song pop songs are usually the most popular songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,til
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks man glad you like it i might rework it a little because i still need an opening track for this thing im doing and i accidentally wrote three more choruses for it last night that i might just sing over that long instrumental part
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh fuck its a version of too bad i have to destroy you now with ye on it thats cool
hiphopheads,not_removed,this sounds like a cudi song with a ye feature
hiphopheads,not_removed,yooo the original sampled daft punks tron legacy score holy shit thats like all my favorite things
hiphopheads,not_removed,this shit flames
hiphopheads,not_removed,im pretty sure it is too but i just posted it as it was listed on sc and section
hiphopheads,not_removed,just finished watching this such a chill ass guy who really seems like a goodhearted guy and a great father and dope ass artist cant wait for the new music
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a hardcore weeknd fan and loved starboy but this was just too far away from what ive loved about his music like im ok with the inbetween parts but i just really hate the false alarm part i dont how to explain it but it just feels the the hook belongs on a shitty early movie action sequence track im a little sad because this is the first weeknd track i can honestly say i dont like at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,good thing a lot of people are liking it cuz i cant stand this shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song has really grown on me i love everything abel has put out so far for this album hope he keeps it up
hiphopheads,not_removed,loving this the chorus isnt what i expect from the weeknd but its dope imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,i preordered the album and i cant listen to it does anyone know why this is
hiphopheads,not_removed,gave it a listen on tidal a few times today i just cant get myself to like it has to be one of the worst let downs for me this season i hope his new album provides some unique sounds while being easier to listen to experimenting is great but it doesnt always work might be him still rejecting his older style to prove he is someone else entirely shame i quite enjoyed it as it filled its own niche nothing else came close now i can find dozens of songs like this but i wont be replaying them after one go luckily there is a lot coming out at the moment new banks album dropped today too and so far its been great
hiphopheads,not_removed,artist title fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,was ehh about starboy but this is pretty dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn i was feeling this song hard until that chorus hit oof hopefully it grows on me or something verses are great though
hiphopheads,not_removed,this reminds me of a really pop version of
hiphopheads,not_removed,artist title
hiphopheads,not_removed,absolutely awful
hiphopheads,not_removed,the chorus is like the hills
hiphopheads,not_removed,spotify link
hiphopheads,not_removed,that hook is what plays when blade goes to a vampire rave to get information on the head vampire hes looking for and it turns out that his long time friend that owns the club set him up and vampire henchmen bust through the windows and they fight in the middle of the rave and you can hardly tell whats happening because of all of the flashing strobe lights
hiphopheads,not_removed,the hook ruins the song for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,its absolutely dreadful hard to believe hes the same artist to drop those mixtapes and to think how optimistic we were with the low life feature and the rambo remix
hiphopheads,not_removed,yall friends or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,because its pre order the full album isnt out yet so you cant listen to all of the tracks until release day
hiphopheads,not_removed,apple music is fucking bullshit i cant even download it on my phone for some reason the dl simply does not start for this song
hiphopheads,not_removed,i am the opposite
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like it better than starboy
hiphopheads,not_removed,his fan base generally calls him abel
hiphopheads,not_removed,yas
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh boy not this again
hiphopheads,not_removed,it sounded weird when i read back my comment with the weeknd in place of abel
hiphopheads,not_removed,he loves everything hes put out wtf you mean how can you say that he literally said so far
hiphopheads,not_removed,also i loved the video and the artwork
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant listen to false alarm he means not the full album
hiphopheads,not_removed,which is what i thought but when starboy came out it was downloaded
hiphopheads,not_removed,its working just fine for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant download it either and im on ios so im not sure what the problem is
hiphopheads,not_removed,same issue with me annoying af
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a fan and i find it pretty cringey
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably because im on android but fuck it i downloaded it from a mirror and put it directly on my phone i need it
hiphopheads,not_removed,all good for me on mobile look at purchased and it should be there and ready to be downloaded
hiphopheads,not_removed,it worked after i reinstalled apple music twice haha

hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i feel like hes definitely underrated as a rapper ever since gunit as a collective fell off that being said i feel like he cant afford better production than these generic ny beats so thats also holding him back

hiphopheads,not_removed,i need that song at the end credits
hiphopheads,not_removed,yup he got paid billions by netflix to remix the intro to narcos as an advertisement for the show
hiphopheads,not_removed,if its selling out its making me more interested in his output at least i considered myself a fan for a while but i got so bored of him and what he had to say
hiphopheads,not_removed,selling out venues
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah hes fucking selling i want him to go back to how he was rapping when he was
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats like saying any artist who does a song for a movie soundtrack is a sell out imo no hes not selling out maybe he did do it for the money but you have to remember his job is to make music and thats how he gets paid
hiphopheads,not_removed,he was being sarcastic
hiphopheads,not_removed,sorry im bad at reading sarcasm
hiphopheads,not_removed,its bowl stove water soda cola fork check and the next lines sound like crazy colour mic check zaytiggy i might check but im not sure about those
hiphopheads,not_removed,omg hell yes thank you so much and yes i think youre right about those next two lines im so glad i can finally rap along with gucci for the chorus i appreciate it fam edit upon further inspection i believe he says crazy colour nikes check and zay give a mic check but i could be wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,yup youre definitely right about the next lines makes way more sense
hiphopheads,not_removed,ayy why are the mods deleting this track everytime its posted anybody know

hiphopheads,not_removed,deet deet hours
hiphopheads,not_removed,still waiting for black mass to drop tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes always been a better producer than rapper so this has me hyped
hiphopheads,not_removed,some bitch on twitter always calling him daddy
hiphopheads,not_removed,why would anyone believe what this man says
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh thank god travis is his production even his vocals are fucking production lets face it
hiphopheads,not_removed,for historical purposes calling it travis scott presents cruel winter
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope he rips off producers i like
hiphopheads,not_removed,hours later and you guys still cant read dude was talking about his work in anti purpose tlop major key encore
hiphopheads,not_removed,please let one of them be more life i need another iyrtitl
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love everything he does and i cant wait for more birds was great and he fed the fans in less than a year after rodeo ill love him even more if he does it again love you travis
hiphopheads,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment it was on honest but yeah the song youre thinking of is benz friends ahh man i love that song but i can understand where youre coming from have you ever listened to his shit it has me way more excited than his usual stuff nowadays i think yung lean is alright but that recent song he did with some autotune he didnt need and some very uninspired beats was just trash edit here we go i feel his way of producing is throwing ideas into the air giving input kinda like this im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch ill keep this updated as long as i can httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get me on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love me some travis scott production and features hopefully he can deliver some more bars than hooks tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think travis is at his best when hes making beats and shit dbr was so great because his production really shined on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i believe hes saying in he was apart of albums anti being one of them
hiphopheads,not_removed,im glad he will be getting back into producing
hiphopheads,not_removed,birds in the trap was my favorite album of its one of the few i bought outside of apple music im looking forward to the blessings from scott in
hiphopheads,not_removed,groan
hiphopheads,not_removed,no offense to big travis scott fans but in my opinion quality quantity its not impressive to me to put out a lot of albums in a short period of time it is impressive to me to put out a timeless masterful album in any amount of time i still listen to chronic in its entirety frequently and often despite such coming out in
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk why people like travis scott so much
hiphopheads,not_removed,young thugs next venture maybe a cudi joint
hiphopheads,not_removed,metro nav andre solo album
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe cashmere cats album cc produced the intro for the ends and there was a rumor that a travis feature is going to be on the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,travis scott x yung lean
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats the consensus on the hold up of king push im new here the prelude is months old at this point
hiphopheads,not_removed,my album
hiphopheads,not_removed,the quavo collab
hiphopheads,not_removed,we really waiting on like thats really gonna happen
hiphopheads,not_removed,has push ever rapped over travis production before because im hype as fuck for this but if it already exists i need to put it on loop
hiphopheads,not_removed,big sean maybe remix a dont play are great
hiphopheads,not_removed,what makes you think desiigner
hiphopheads,not_removed,wouldnt be surprised to see him on a weeknd track
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres no shot kanyes album will actually be called that and i doubt itll even be out this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,do people really think turbo grafx is actually real
hiphopheads,not_removed,is cruel winter the album with lean
hiphopheads,not_removed,straight up
hiphopheads,not_removed,need some more cactus stroking tbh ngl fr
hiphopheads,not_removed,very okay with this hopefully more songs like maria im drunk
hiphopheads,not_removed,does he trust you tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah we need to get this out of the way quickly so that we can find a new live travis scott song to circle jerk before we get a disappointing cdq
hiphopheads,not_removed,throwback to when he had me chanting august at coney island played everyone haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,travis confirmed to a fan hes not dropping left cheek right cheek edit fan in australia met him in public and took a photo with him asked him in person about the song travis said he isnt going to release it source from a post on travis scott talk worldwide facebook group
hiphopheads,not_removed,prob would cost you like lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah same here b
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit i heard he gifted you some song that people have been asking for for like a year right
hiphopheads,not_removed,im hoping he actually takes his time with that rather than dishing it out so quickly like he did birds
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought that at first as well but he does use this year on both tweets and hes definitely talking about in the second one
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats exactly what i thought op misread the fuck out of those tweets
hiphopheads,not_removed,cudi
hiphopheads,not_removed,does birds count haha also dj snakes album he had a feature on there what was his role on tlop though
hiphopheads,not_removed,prolly just hyping it up just hoping for the best
hiphopheads,not_removed,nye about to be too lit if true
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably not including his own collab album then
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,travis x quavo tape isnt a real thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly it could be anybody travis is becoming more and more popular
hiphopheads,not_removed,reference
hiphopheads,not_removed,you just reminded me that this exists and now im upset
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have like a pretty good version on my comp its min and seconds
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean he doesnt actually produce most of his music the only song on his last projects that he was the primary producer on is apple pie
hiphopheads,not_removed,who wouldnt
hiphopheads,not_removed,you clearly dont use twitter
hiphopheads,not_removed,id let him have his way with my ass too fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,stans
hiphopheads,not_removed,everything from him its his production but hes amazing at it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree i want to be in history books too ¯ツ¯
hiphopheads,not_removed,and hes not including birds in the trap sing mcknight
hiphopheads,not_removed,birds rodeo and dbr are all flames and uk it
hiphopheads,not_removed,because they enjoy his music they like the sound of it it pleases their ears the sound waves bring pleasure the melodies are considered delightful the sounds of the music variety are enjoyable
hiphopheads,not_removed,his aesthetic is really unique his influences are trap but hes nothing like young thug future etc he always adds a little spice to trap music and always layers his production example production and outro
hiphopheads,not_removed,because his music sounds good
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know why u still commenting smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,takes balls to ask that on this sub
hiphopheads,not_removed,stop trying to plug your own beats fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought you were saying young thugs next venture may be a cudi joint that would be something else
hiphopheads,not_removed,im gonna be disappointed if travis is anywhere near the stacks solo album tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,im ok with this
hiphopheads,not_removed,that dude with that chill ass song in gtav dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,its out doe lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,his album leaked already theres no trab production on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,surprised it took this long for someone to say it theyve been in the studio and frost god was only a mixtape guessing lean is gonna have an album coming fallwinter
hiphopheads,not_removed,no one knows honestly
hiphopheads,not_removed,ya same
hiphopheads,not_removed,we got hours yeezy season is here
hiphopheads,not_removed,push has been on beats with travis coproduction but its hard to say how much travis actually does to the beats
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre both good music
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyve been saying for cruel winter all of and travis announced he was executive producing it back in september they released one single champions and that yo gotti single castro that is clearly from the same sessions so it definitely appears like good is keeping on track with this project plus they need to showcase shake and desiigner before they drop their solo albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,kanyes supposedly upcoming album currently titled turbografx
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was on kanyes twitter what could be more real than that
hiphopheads,not_removed,not sure if youre serious but nah its the compilation record for good music kanyes label follows up cruel summer from a few years back
hiphopheads,not_removed,its lit
hiphopheads,not_removed,future travis scott
hiphopheads,not_removed,im glad you had the courage to be honest with that one
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,wonderful
hiphopheads,not_removed,when why where who
hiphopheads,not_removed,source
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive been waiting for soooo long
hiphopheads,not_removed,no he didnt
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah man real recognize real
hiphopheads,not_removed,birds was originally supposed to be a mixtape iirc and it was more of an appetizer for astroworld so i have hope i personally loved birds though
hiphopheads,not_removed,birds got dished out quickly this motherfucker released that album months after the first announce date so i think he got more than enough time
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah in the tweet he says making more beats as in presentfuture tense instead of i made more beats this year which would be past tense
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think yall are misreading he says this year in both of them and is clearly talking about in the second one
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think he is on fml
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,before bittsm released travis said that it was releasing in deet deet hours which it didnt
hiphopheads,not_removed,send send send
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have it too but the quality isnt that good and its too short obviously
hiphopheads,not_removed,and it was dope as hell
hiphopheads,not_removed,what i should have said is the production on his tracks has always been the main draw for me to his music as opposed to his rapping the production on days before rodeo is fucking beautiful in my opinion drugs you should try it is one of the most pleasing to the ears songs ive heard in a while im not sure how much of the production he actually contributed on the tracks but he does have credits for most of them if you have any articles or anything talking about how much he has contributed himself id love to read them basically if he can bring the production quality that is on most of his projects to the stuff he is working on this year i would be very happy
hiphopheads,not_removed,his music just doesnt really appeal to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like both
hiphopheads,not_removed,please dont let cudi soil thugger
hiphopheads,not_removed,itd probably be bad haha but who knows
hiphopheads,not_removed,why the ends is great
hiphopheads,not_removed,as a trav stan me too but the way andre is you never really know hopefully pharrell there if cudi has to be there too
hiphopheads,not_removed,he also has a really good collab song with dj mustard ice rink
hiphopheads,not_removed,i fucking love that song gtav in general exposed me to so many different artists and songs that i had no idea existed
hiphopheads,not_removed,unfinished demos not the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think yung lean is alright but that recent song he did with some autotune he didnt need and some very uninspired beats was just trash edit here we go
hiphopheads,not_removed,didnt he say it was coming early along with turbo grafx
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk what that means but imma set an alarm for hours and i swear if aint here man
hiphopheads,not_removed,what songs in particular im a big push fan but o guess not big enough to know whos on prod 💁
hiphopheads,not_removed,ye hasnt been in a solid state of mind for a while he has also been doing a lot for attention and i dont take his twitter very seriously anymore especially with all the rappers claiming they have multiple finished projects coming but they never surface on top of that he claims its named after a game system and he said it would be out over summer now its about to be
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok i got all of them except ham
hiphopheads,not_removed,needs more pixels lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,another one
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant be the only one who fucks with that song heavy
hiphopheads,not_removed,god damn that song triggered me so fucking much as you can tell im still triggered like honestly listen to and httpssoundcloudcomjdremixertravisscottwonderfulognoweekndnotcdq and tell me that the monstrosity of a song we got was better
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was so excited for it and then it got released and it sucked i would still rather listen to the leak or whatever
hiphopheads,not_removed,true hes on my mixtape too
hiphopheads,not_removed,precum
hiphopheads,not_removed,source
hiphopheads,not_removed,correct
hiphopheads,not_removed,he was making it while on tour though
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah too many tracks it sucks that i have to say that considering the last time we got cudders
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes on the og version but thats the weeknd on the albums version
hiphopheads,not_removed,that isnt true he never said how long a deet deet was
hiphopheads,not_removed,ah i see
hiphopheads,not_removed,would you say that that one beat is better than anything hes ever done as a rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel his way of producing is throwing ideas into the air giving input kinda like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,it seems to me with the production he works like someone like dre would
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you lol so lame how the proyt comments are up but pro cudi comments are down theyre both opinions in some other thread itll be the opposite the base reaction of different opinion downvote makes this sub toxic sometimes
hiphopheads,not_removed,this thread will be fun
hiphopheads,not_removed,mods lock the thread
hiphopheads,not_removed,bitch hold on
hiphopheads,not_removed,see now i actually want a song ep with them just mostly thugger bars with cudi ad libs in the background and him doing hooks call it moonthuggin
hiphopheads,not_removed,the silent majority agrees
hiphopheads,not_removed,uhhhhh
hiphopheads,not_removed,go home youre drunk
hiphopheads,not_removed,other way around kid
hiphopheads,not_removed,thugger a nobody
hiphopheads,not_removed,gtfo
hiphopheads,not_removed,opposite
hiphopheads,not_removed,because andre can fit on any track he wants to but travis pretty much only works on tracks that are travis tracks and i dont want a travis track on a long awaited stacks album i want andre songs i dont think his production or guest feature would fit on anything that dre makes unless its just a straight up cuditravis inspired album which doesnt sound that good either
hiphopheads,not_removed,is it if thats the quality of an andre solo album ill be incredibly disappointed
hiphopheads,not_removed,also party girls by ludacris which is a stupid song but i like it
hiphopheads,not_removed,have you heard it some of it sounds p damn finished either way no trab production
hiphopheads,not_removed,ahh man i love that song but i can understand where youre coming from have you ever listened to his shit it has me way more excited than his usual stuff nowadays
hiphopheads,not_removed,last thing pusha said was before the end of the year and that was a couple of months ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,i highly doubt well be getting turbo grafx in after what happened with the pablo tour hopefully we get king push though or maybe president push is using good music as a front sold more dope than you sold records sold more records than you sold dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,i always took the in tg to mean 😂
hiphopheads,not_removed,blocka and the morningfrom cruel summer
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was sarcasm nothing on kanyes twitter is real
hiphopheads,not_removed,hard as a motherfucker popularized by kanye and jayz
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats my text alert rn
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah man i do not get the wonderful hate at all i love everything from the beat to travis to the weeknd one of the first songs that made me really start to like travis besides his uber everywhere remix and obviously antidote
hiphopheads,not_removed,wonderful is so fucking good like last year i spent like an hr or more singing a lot with it trying to memorize the lyrics
hiphopheads,not_removed,what do you like about that more than the final version the weeknds vocal performance on that second verse is much better than travis especially on that i love my bitches when they bite line it sounds like travis just threw that in as a filler line but when abel says it it really sounds like he fucking loves it when his bitches bite and the back and forth aspect adds a lot to the vibe of the song plus those ad libbed oh mys that the weeknd does when travis speeds up his flow and catches the beat when hes saying lemme try this one more again makes you feel even more excited and disoriented as hes rapping theres really a ton of little things trav got the weeknd to add to wonderful to take it to the next level
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk i enjoy the weeknd on it alot that still sounds like a demo
hiphopheads,not_removed,what was wrong with the hunnid deep line and switchup it has the change necessary in a hook but nope guess not aaaaaaaaaaaaah at least the ends and the goosebump snippets were untouched thank god
hiphopheads,not_removed,i havent even gotten my cactus off yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant find one but i could swear that there was an article or something earlier this year where he said it was an appetizer for astroworld my brain might just be making this up though
hiphopheads,not_removed,zane lowe interview when he announced wav
hiphopheads,not_removed,and it sounded like it was dished out quickly lots of uninspired repetitive production
hiphopheads,not_removed,ehhhhhhhh i highly doubt he had anything to do with starboy besides once producing a similar to a track or two
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol i can almost guarantee travis cott had absolutely nothing to do with blonde
hiphopheads,not_removed,part of doesnt necessarily mean feature in
hiphopheads,not_removed,everyone assumed he meant digits so a maximum of hours
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk how to compare rapping and producing theyre two different fields its like apple pie to apple sauce
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes you ever listen to owl pharoah
hiphopheads,not_removed,mmmmmmmmmmyeeaaaaah
hiphopheads,not_removed,moanthuggin
hiphopheads,not_removed,i could see it and i think it could work but a full project with the two i dont think would be good with cudis current form
hiphopheads,not_removed,thugger rapping incoherently and cudi moaning incoherently what a great time that would be s
hiphopheads,not_removed,truth is a funny way to spell opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,i liked his new album the run from the first song to flight at first sight is in my opinion his strongest group of songs since his man on the moon days after that its a mixed bag of just chill but forgettable vibe songs songs that shouldve been cut out and some really great songs especially the last three indicud was also great to me i appreciate satellite flight for what it was and still give it a listen when im in the mood speedin bullet heaven was unlistenable to me other than the title track but his new album is a pretty good return to form in my eyes
hiphopheads,not_removed,new cudi is not hh i still like it very much tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,how so
hiphopheads,not_removed,no cudi has made a solid decline with a slight return to form with ppds thugger has been releasing pretty consistently good music
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is completely reasonable i think it would be odd if stacks long awaited album is suddenly influenced by a guy with maybe years of real recognition in the rap game i would like to hear more from these guys working together but its true that its more that can fit in anywhere as opposed to him being a complement to their respective sounds does anyone remember that one joint with future off of what i believe was the monster mixtape i could be wrong on that one but i remember being real surprised to see stacks on the tracklist killed it
hiphopheads,not_removed,travis is a hook monster last time being a good recent example
hiphopheads,not_removed,but what is an andre track at this point for a long time now he hasnt stuck to one sound and has been on everything from boom bap to experimental instrumentals and the fact we know hes capable of shining on anything means his next project could literally sound like anything he could a full futuristic sounding album in which travis would be a good fit if he goes traditional atliens which i higly doubt then i take your point but isnt one to stick to any particular sound especially not rehash it
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i wasnt gonna go into that but the ends is just good at best not great travis actually raps pretty well compared to his usual melody based stuff but stacks is the real star of the show on that track and if it was a song on his solo album i would be pretty damn disappointed by it features are supposed to match enhance or exceed the original artist not appear lackluster next to them
hiphopheads,not_removed,wild love tmap and after coachella are definitely going to be on the album but i feel like the rest is speculation maybe fallin and all night
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh hey man i wasnt trying to put down your opinion or anything im sorry i just think he does well without that oversensitive autotune stuff i dont usually fuck with yung lean but that shit is that like his side project or is this something thats now defunct was actually very relaxing and nice
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt even know about this this is lit af
hiphopheads,not_removed,bits bro cmon
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit blocka seems obvious now that youve said it but trav poduced the fucking morning as much as i like trab the production on that song is so fucking fierce in surprised to be honest didnt realise he was that good of a producer
hiphopheads,not_removed,hard as a motherfucker as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think that the mixing on the final version is really bad and that hurts it listen to that snippet again the effects on traviss voice on the beat sound perfect in the og you can hear everything in the beat clearly and traviss voice dosnt rape my ears like in the final like in the final his voice has so much shit on it that it dosnt sound good i mean dont get me wrong i love pornography where his voice had a ton of effects on it but in this case its to the detriment to the song also the beat in the final version sounds muffled and somehow drowned in reverb which is not good for thr fucking beat its hard to hear the ice crean truck esc synth in the background and the hats are really washed out i remember seeing the song and then decideing to ride around randomly and blast it but after a while i had to turn it low af because it was physically hurting my ears and casuing me physical pain like im not even just saying that as a joke thats just how bad the fucking mixing is so basically imo he added a bunch of pointless shit to it ie the weeknd and app those effects and totally ruined the song
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont like how high theweeknds voice is in the second part after he changes his flow i prefer og wonderful over final version anytime
hiphopheads,not_removed,indeed the weeknd version adds more depth to the song its much better imo but thats just the producer in me talking
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i really like weeknds part and honestly there isnt much difference in the other parts sounds like he just doesnt like weeknds part that doesnt necessarily mean an unreleased snippet would be better
hiphopheads,not_removed,i havent even hit my palace yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,i guess it makes sense considering travis announced astroworld for i always thought birds was astroworld when it dropped im pretty happy its not though
hiphopheads,not_removed,he has adlibs on all i know
hiphopheads,not_removed,wishing you godspeeeeeeeddd straight up
hiphopheads,not_removed,almost guarantee lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh ok thank you
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn you have a good point
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not that hard really
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok so apple sauce or pie
hiphopheads,not_removed,does it make you feel more than anything hes rapped its not hard
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah ill be honest i thought it was kinda a mess he sounds way too close to his influences and the mix is bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,by design is fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,i remember hearing cudi say in a interview that he is actually not hip hop and actually really gets annoyed or something like that when people try to put him in any specific genre
hiphopheads,not_removed,cudi ever really been hip hop look at all of his albums edit cuz niggas are gonna take this the wrong way like usual cudi is more alternative than hiphop alternative hiphop and he is still in that lane i wouldnt label him hiphop before alternative though so while i was cheesed at it didnt not make sense like he rapsbut is he hiphop that is a bigger question no
hiphopheads,not_removed,fair enough
hiphopheads,not_removed,thug individually cant release a single song i want to listen to
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was on honest but yeah the song youre thinking of is httpyoutubexxlqiofdvy
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea thats like if say like years ago jay z wouldve let some kid who had never released an album have a huge effect on his best album thatd be ridiculous
hiphopheads,not_removed,to be fair that would probably fall under what he would call a travis track
hiphopheads,not_removed,i could honestly see a lot of people do the same melody that travis did on last time thug future migos for example not to say it wasnt a good feature but it wasnt a hook specifically meant for travis and i dont think travis made it anymore special than it was which is what id consider a fantastic feature
hiphopheads,not_removed,travis is a god while producing i love his music because of how good and interesting it sounds im way happier having him im the background
hiphopheads,not_removed,last time is fucking great i was so excited for laflame and laflare would absolutely love a joint tape
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not a good example
hiphopheads,not_removed,but isnt one to stick to any particular sound especially not rehash it exactly so why rehash traviss
hiphopheads,not_removed,gets no benefit from travis whereas this would cement travis in the rap game i cant see it happening
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah hes got two side projects he was recently performing some songs so maybe well get new stuff from that and hes also got död mark with yung gud which is something around the lines of a swedish rock band
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit that would explain the song names im a fucking idiot
hiphopheads,not_removed,he only coproduced both i wouldnt give him too much credit for them im pretty sure blocka is mostly young chop
hiphopheads,not_removed,wikipedia says its produced by illmind and kanye with coproduction from travis i have no idea who did what on the track though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i gotchu dude also are you talking about the soundcloud version or the album version i think the mixing on the two are pretty different and the weeknds voice doesnt pierce the center of your skull on the high notes on the album version
hiphopheads,not_removed,as much as i love both travis and blonde they do not mix well together at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah almost guarantee is this even a real possibility what reason would anyone have to believe travis cott worked on blonde his name isnt anywhere on the credits and neither have claimed to have worked with eachother
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah you just throw the applesauce in the trash
hiphopheads,not_removed,im american but not white never got into the whole apple pie thing sounds like a heart attack waiting to happen applesauce isnt much better but im used to it as a solid school snack
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with you and think its some of his best
hiphopheads,not_removed,by design is wild baptized in fire was great pharrell williams goes wild with the drums i love it took some acid listened to this for the first time when it dropped i was insane
hiphopheads,not_removed,true completely forgot about that one just a shame its followed by my least favorite song dance eternity tried to get into that song through multiple listens but its just awful for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes thats like asking if kanye is hip hop just because he has an innovative sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,jesus christ have you ever listened to cudi he was a fucking god for like years straight
hiphopheads,not_removed,try his song numbers off barter
hiphopheads,not_removed,travis isnt kanye not even close
hiphopheads,not_removed,travis isnt kanye not even close
hiphopheads,not_removed,only thug could have done that hook better
hiphopheads,not_removed,his shit is wild hes insane at currating a vibe i love travis on other ppls songs and the features on birds in the trap really shows how versatile he is i love guidance and goosebumps i dont know why more people dont like the kid
hiphopheads,not_removed,basically yeah best case stacks puts him as background vocals on something if he really feels like itll fit on a track but i couldnt see him being a vocal or production feature
hiphopheads,not_removed,that död mark stuff is actually really good yung lean been sleepin on me i guess lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,busy honestly before this thread i was giving his production basically no credit even if hes just a co producer on incredible beats surely he deserves some recognition or does a co producer do even less than the minimal amount i thought they did edit co producer has been my dream job for a long time just slapping my name on beats after saying shit like more drums or less drums
hiphopheads,not_removed,doesnt sound like a travis beat at all if i had to guess id say he didnt have much to do with it but of course thats just conjecture
hiphopheads,not_removed,the mixing on soundcloud is worse i agree but the enitre album is mixed like shit save putp so it still rapes my ears but not quite as bad as the soundcloud version
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with you almost guarantee just means pretty sure by including almost its no longer a guarantee which is not a word that has degrees but i digress youre correct
hiphopheads,not_removed,apple pie sounds like a heart attack waiting to happen its literally the same thing as any fucking fruit pie i dont get the obese us circlejerk where the fuck you at ireland meat pies cheesecake if you have ti pecan pie any fucking cake tiramisu all closejust as bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,ooh yes i have a strip of lsd in my freezer as soon as i get a few days off work im going to try this literally hated travis scotts birds in the trap untill i listened to it on acid it just completely clicked
hiphopheads,not_removed,id say the album was like songs too long dont have to love it all the main point is that cudis back on track to making good music
hiphopheads,not_removed,cudi is like steps further than kanye so far id label cudi more alternative than just hip hop i feel like atcq was the same way for their time like listen to his first albums and the production isnt hiphop the lyrics arent traditional hiphop he raps but he sings a lot as well hes kinda like in that songrap which in this scenario i wouldnt really classify as hiphop besides him kinda just being grouped in i think im buggin though and my view for hiphop might be different from the actual classification
hiphopheads,not_removed,read my edit
hiphopheads,not_removed,ill let you know what i think fyi slugs is the only thug song i dont skip and actually like his hook
hiphopheads,not_removed,better
hiphopheads,not_removed,you mean youve been sleepin on yung lean
hiphopheads,not_removed,like you said he couldve just said more drums and got a credit its hard to say
hiphopheads,not_removed,i said that because apple pie is an american thing and im explaining why i never got into it it just also sounds like a bad idea no i also dont eat other fruit pie lol pie is what sounds bad to me i agree with you i just said im american
hiphopheads,not_removed,uptown is legit my favorite travis scott song
hiphopheads,not_removed,he pushes the genre sure but its definitely still hiphop
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to old cudi man not anything from the past few years he started to produce alot of shit music for a while out of nowhere and hes starting to get back on track with this album
hiphopheads,not_removed,ah fair i fucking hate this on a track i need a beat breakdown for each collaborator for each track 😂
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive been listening cudi a long time i already know the sounds i was saying hes not really hip hop its not a bad thing im just stating thats how i view his music
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think you said niggas enough
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like your editing its on point
hiphopheads,not_removed,this might be the hottest track out rn future is the goat
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,so it already dropped
hiphopheads,not_removed,leaked
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think its a fake tde page that claims to be official httpswwwyoutubecomusertopdawgenttde
hiphopheads,not_removed,deleted
hiphopheads,not_removed,these guys are from atlanta and go to my college school they are extremely talented and have a very unique sound they started out on soundcloud and had a hit song pretty quickly a year later and they have now signed for awful records the same record label as father this is the music video for body from their new album world wide web listen to it if you like that wavy shit but also check them out because i genuinely believe they are going somewhere big and you should trust strangers online also check out their song diamonds which was their first hit song and a fucking banger

hiphopheads,not_removed,i know this sub aint hip to divine council but im really surprised that a song with a stacks feature has been up for minutes and theres only one comment so far anyway this track is fye
hiphopheads,not_removed,divine council bout to blow up this year now so glad cause everyone sleepin on them
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn andre been dropping verses like crazy this year i hope this means hes getting ready to release solo material
hiphopheads,not_removed,all about that paper like i work for dunder mifflin hahahahahahaha
hiphopheads,not_removed,man i dont know anything about these guys but if they can get stacks on a song and drop an office reference then theyre about to get some plays
hiphopheads,not_removed,andre snapped holy
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,i fucked her like she was a dyke and needed reminding what good dick was like goat
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is fresh as fuck check out that i love produced by shlohmo
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is wonderful andre goes off but he always does when he jumps on something im kind of ashamed to say i dont know anything about divine council because this song is awesome even sans stacks
hiphopheads,not_removed,divine council finna put richmond on the map
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is the best surprise song i ever couldve stumbled upon
hiphopheads,not_removed,holyyyyyyy fuckkkk killer hook dope verses and then that bomb ass andre feature stellar track
hiphopheads,not_removed,so to my guys putting in for rva awesome to see them come this far
hiphopheads,not_removed,this track is nuts
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant wait for milk
hiphopheads,not_removed,i fuck with lord linco a lot tommy hilfiger and rolie polie olie both fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,can see what dc are doing and they deserve every second of fame
hiphopheads,not_removed,mimgurcombvrvola
hiphopheads,not_removed,if they talking down on council beat their ass
hiphopheads,not_removed,divine council bout to get they love
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song is hilarious the crazy hook the lines in the first verse about the shelf andres line about busting at the cops like the whole things just so absurd especially since andre verses are usually so rare and he decided to jump on this track i love it
hiphopheads,not_removed,from the first second i entered the state that made me relax chill and vibe to the beat divine council has a very bright future if already now legend in the face of andre pays attention to them
hiphopheads,not_removed,anyone got a mirror nonyoutube ideally
hiphopheads,not_removed,easily one of the best songs of the year fuck moar ppl need to get on this
hiphopheads,not_removed,andre going full thugger recently
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is fucking flames
hiphopheads,not_removed,woah this is crazy for them check up on divine council if you havent they all have nice songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,been obsessed with divine council recently hopefully this gets them more hhh notoriety
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is great
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn my friends opened for these guys almost a month ago this is dope to hear
hiphopheads,not_removed,is andre rebranding himself now on this track and the ones on cudis album he is called andre benjamin rather than andre could this maybe mean a personal solo album
hiphopheads,not_removed,outkast album next month ive been warning you but the downvotes keep raining
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit my bruvas really got the feature theyre about to blow tf up
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow andre killed this not that i really expected anything different
hiphopheads,not_removed,what the fuck i remember following ilk and rest of them back in and wed just chop it up about weed and music now they have a stacks feature and i havent dropped anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,anybody else notice is going by his government andre benjamin now check the cover for this single and the tracklisting for cudis new album could be a sign of a new chapter on the horizon
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song is awkward im never listening to it again
hiphopheads,not_removed,erykah badu cosigned them on twitter and theyre signed to epic during their meeting with la reid andré calling in to give his endorsement
hiphopheads,not_removed,what are some similar vibed artists i love dc but need more
hiphopheads,not_removed,divine council has some connection to erykah and andres son idk if theyre his friends or hes part of the crew but im certain thats why they got a verse from him
hiphopheads,not_removed,where do i start with these guys
hiphopheads,not_removed,havent really seem much talk about them on here wheres the animosity stem fromwhy
hiphopheads,not_removed,that office reference killed me but figured someone has to have used that line before right
hiphopheads,not_removed,dick in the dope is the shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,mutant academy next up after them though those guys are ridiculous
hiphopheads,not_removed,lateisha is a fucking banger too
hiphopheads,not_removed,stopandre sounded nothing like thug
hiphopheads,not_removed,what is the evidence of that possibility tho whats big boi been up to
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes not part of the group so hes a friend most likely i know that during the call where andré called up la reid to cosign divine council it was actually seven his and badus oldest song that put him on the phone
hiphopheads,not_removed,they own his child
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,small world i personally know those guys got their last project burned on a cd from henny lo fucking va
hiphopheads,not_removed,acts with purpose
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah seven is who i was talking about i didnt know andre made that call though
hiphopheads,not_removed,god bless fam ive been listening to their soundcloud shit for like a year now but i wasnt ready to invest in their bandcamp but still wanted to check out some of their projects
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats dope i dont know them closely but i met them at an ohbliv show and they really impressed me
hiphopheads,not_removed,flumes album is awesome
hiphopheads,not_removed,so pumped to hear more vince rapping over flume beats
hiphopheads,not_removed,the whole thing is so good that song with raekwon is so good
hiphopheads,not_removed,whoa donnie nico really out here super dope to see this collab paul simon the social experiment
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is fucking wild for nico and nate very happy for them paul simon is a legend i like the song as well ive heard good things about the latest paul simon album ill have to check it out
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love the instrumental its quite beautiful huge ups for nico and nate such a honor of a cosign
hiphopheads,not_removed,seriously paul simon is like a songwriter of all time thats a huge cosign would love to see him pull a paul mccartney and collab with some rappers i feel like his lyrical style might actually mesh pretty well with hip hop and i think hes still got it musically
hiphopheads,not_removed,mans
hiphopheads,not_removed,paul simon straight raps on his album that came out a few months ago he aint good but its a step in the right direction
hiphopheads,not_removed,mangs

hiphopheads,not_removed,not this again
hiphopheads,not_removed,if youve seen it already then just move on or downvote youre only wasting your own time commenting like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,getting pouped on here
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a minute video explaining why rappers use grey poupon in their lyrics and it just boils down to it being easily rhymed with much bigger waste of time than writing a comment
hiphopheads,not_removed,not gonna condescend you but there is much more rap historyconsumer history in the video then just the rhyme section but yes that is a big part of it
hiphopheads,not_removed,you missed the interlude where calls raekwon a pass the grey poupon nigga
hiphopheads,not_removed,you deserve a thousand years in hell for dis shit

hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly i cant expect mick or lance to blow up after their lackluster debuts
hiphopheads,not_removed,for some reason i dont really like cartier
hiphopheads,not_removed,he killed it on fettimaxo
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope he becomes a xxl freshman
hiphopheads,not_removed,is it you
hiphopheads,not_removed,divine council need to stop talking so much shit on twitter they arent helping themselves at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe on hhh but not to the youth
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk ab that bc hes on probation now so hes sober and my friends has a few song with him and he sent him his new shit and its good af
hiphopheads,not_removed,micks album wasnt even lackluster everybody just wanted and expected him to repeat the waters
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love fetti but thats nowhere near my favorite maxo verse dude murders just about every verse
hiphopheads,not_removed,of course
hiphopheads,not_removed,id have to say randy moss freestyle is hands down my favorite maxo song
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats your fav song from him
hiphopheads,not_removed,hard to beat thirteen for me but he doesnt have any songs that i would consider bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,thirteen and hit mane i love when he can paint a vivid picture in my head
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you
hiphopheads,not_removed,no problem man if you dig him listen to all of when you get the chance hes my favorite up and coming trap rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah def bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,at first didnt like it on because of the internet then i grew to love it
hiphopheads,not_removed,nope pablo is a classic
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah as long as it works i like it
hiphopheads,not_removed,almost every classic kanye song has two dope as hell solid verses and the last one is like he wrote it on lean or something minutes before sending the album in kinda funny to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,drakes switch up on further things is too nice imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,no feet high and rising
hiphopheads,not_removed,public enemy it takes a nation of millions to hold us back
hiphopheads,not_removed,its on there
hiphopheads,not_removed,i must be going blind
hiphopheads,not_removed,search hot boy on spinrilla and the album with his face in black and white has the whole album
hiphopheads,not_removed,tidal
hiphopheads,not_removed,appreciate it dawg
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo i cant find it can u check whether its still there
hiphopheads,not_removed,not sure if youre trolling or didnt read the part i said not tidal but i appreciate the input lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,just go search glory on snpinrilla
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,still cant find it thx for the help tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,what is happening to this sub right now
hiphopheads,not_removed,hahahahaha yall niggas wilding hes a disrespectful little shit and this crap is outta line why go after a mans mom
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel you he is going too far and he better stay hella relevant with his next release if he dont want to be a one hit wonder
hiphopheads,not_removed,how is this shit out of line fuck that niggas rap much more disrespectful shit and x is clearly trying to get a response if were reeallly lucky well get some nice diss tracks from this what is the issue i really dont get it
hiphopheads,not_removed,x nice diss tracks stop it are you stupid you think drake is responding to the taunts of a dumbass seriously if some retarded kid insulted you are you going to insult back if you do youre equally retarded the only thing x is doing is embarrassing himself the issue i have with this is that he resorted to bringing him another persons mother look at hiphop beefs across the generations i cant find one not pac cube or went that far imagine some up and coming emcee said kanye you became a bitch and your albums started dropping after your mom died do her a favor and reinvent yourself instead of embarrassing her ugly ass most people can say thats out of line but according to you niggas rap much more disrespectful shit if this is what gets you wet more power to you
hiphopheads,not_removed,he already had his response drake has reached out to dj carnage concerning x and everybody knows it however drake remains the biggest rapper xs comment about drakes mom are really borderline but its beef they will get at it eventually and i guess he might get ready
hiphopheads,not_removed,you dont think x would be able to send some solid shots drakes way obviously dude could get disrespectful as hell and his style is naturally much more aggressive than drakes which would lead to disses that are at least harder than drakes i dont think drake will respond at all though which is why i said if we were lucky i dont see why you wouldnt want rap beef though if youre so confident drake would destroy him and you hate x so much why not actually see if it happens edit not to mention no matter what happens this is free publicity for x even if drake doesnt respond
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont care if the beef happens or not fact is x is whack and im not interested in what diss track he manages to conjure up i dont hate the man i dont know him i just think his music is whack and i can do without hearing anymore of it if the beef happens so be it hope its everything you hoped it to be

hiphopheads,not_removed,lol you know it bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would start with her album kala and if you like it check out any of her other albums she only has a few so you cant go wrong if you like what you hear on kala
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a whole new style maybe even subgenre were talking about like it seems so simple to me now rapping about weed genius
hiphopheads,not_removed,what venue
hiphopheads,not_removed,the regency ballroom
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit that cover is dope as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant wait to hear what hes got exis was good and heavily slept on hope this one finally puts him in the spotlight dude is very talented
hiphopheads,not_removed,cover hypes me up for this tape
hiphopheads,not_removed,looks like a young mj in his thriller days
hiphopheads,not_removed,lets fucking go havent been this excited for an albumtape in basically forever exis was probably my favourite and definitely most listened to project of last year and i have been needing new roy woods ever since imo he doesnt have a single bad song granted he doesnt have many songs lol his last two songs have sounded so much more polished and mature really eager to see if he carries that across a whole project and just generally excited to see what type of sound he brings to it if youre not familiar with roy make yourself familiar with him check out his last two singles how i feel and gwan big up urself or just listen to the whole exis project its only like tracks hopefully by the end of it youre as hyped for this release as i am
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is so out of nowhere im so excited
hiphopheads,not_removed,fucking love roy woods him and frank ocean are my favorite artists i love rap but those two guys are so unique i just love their sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,also hoping for a ramriddlz and uzi feature both of their styles i could see working well with roy
hiphopheads,not_removed,damm this is the only time where i wish this month was a day shorter
hiphopheads,not_removed,so this technically means tomorrow pm est right sooo excited maaan roy is such a talented artist willing to bet this will be one of the top projects of the year
hiphopheads,not_removed,word going to see dvsn live that night and then coming home to fresh roy woods ovounruly
hiphopheads,not_removed,roy is soooooooo good
hiphopheads,not_removed,its like a more sinister version of exis
hiphopheads,not_removed,exis is such a good project i discovered each song one at a time the way he sings with the beat in go go go and jealousy im so stoked for this him and party are probably in my top
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont tease me
hiphopheads,not_removed,he announced july in the last ovo radio episode
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know but i wasnt expecting july very exciting
hiphopheads,not_removed,canada day will be good for promotion if he gets spins on the radio on that day specificly if people do things they enjoy while they first listen to his shit then hell pick up some new fans
hiphopheads,not_removed,only part i ever think about in this song was the you wanted an intimate date i want to intimidate
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love how the verses get progressively better one of the best tracks on the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i loved most of this album funnily enough the songs that i see praised on here brainless asshole evil twin and a few more are the ones i hate the most on this album this song is definitely a highlight though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love this song because its just two great rappers at the top of their technical game eminem debatable having a ton of fun and it comes through in the bars im a sucker for love youre a sucker for dick
hiphopheads,not_removed,at first i hated this song i dig it now though good to hear kendrick just have fun sometimes
hiphopheads,not_removed,once you get past the this isnt what i expected you start to appreciate the song more and actually notice that bars are being spit
hiphopheads,not_removed,brainless is dope because its the closest he came to that sslpmmlp sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was fuckin great
hiphopheads,not_removed,his face lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,dreamchasers dreamchasers dreams worth more than money dreams and nightmares dreamchasers dreamchasers
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like it g
hiphopheads,not_removed,im learning about mixing rn and gotta also get a interface and mic lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,is untouchable
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope denzel is on joeys upcoming album i really enjoyed zenith from imperial i would take joey overall so far i love summer knights and
hiphopheads,not_removed,apples and oranges man joeys got an old classic ny vibe and curry has an aggressive southern game no point in comparing them
hiphopheads,not_removed,id say joey is the better lyricist but denzels energy is insane and i listen to him much more than i listen to joey love them both tho and joey can murder his features both are solid freestylers too
hiphopheads,not_removed,i see a lot of potential in denzel but this is no debate as of right now
hiphopheads,not_removed,where should i start and what should i expect if im trying to get into curry
hiphopheads,not_removed,denzels lyrics take a minute to be able to process tho just outta the way he delivers dude has some seriously incredible word combinations and entendres and whatnot
hiphopheads,not_removed,start with any of his projects zelnostalgic expect great production ridiculously high energy and solid bars his flow gets sloppy here and there but hes dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,imperial is the most polished soundingreadily accessible the older stuff has a rawer energy that is still dope apparently its getting remastered as well now tho so that could be big for denzel
hiphopheads,not_removed,redo
hiphopheads,not_removed,so good
hiphopheads,not_removed,heavy af
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is so good damn see this guy going places very soon great beats and his energy is phenomenal both on recordings and live
hiphopheads,not_removed,🔥🔥🔥
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn im australian and dont really fuck with aussie hip hop anymore but i copped this after listening to the previews sounds heavy
hiphopheads,not_removed,this that flames
hiphopheads,not_removed,the song is nigga needs boogie
hiphopheads,not_removed,this seems to be httpssoundcloudcomcookinsoulfreddiegibbsthugtillits still super dope

hiphopheads,not_removed,the picture with the chainsaw gun is actually fuckin sick
hiphopheads,not_removed,make it stop
hiphopheads,not_removed,with xbox these dudes are old as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,uh no why would you think that they havent missed yet if they keep up with the quality then this is a great way for them to promote themselves
hiphopheads,not_removed,why
hiphopheads,not_removed,an rtj cut was on a gears of war trailer weeks ago it already happened
hiphopheads,not_removed,when some of your favorite rappers collab with one of your leastfavorite companies
hiphopheads,not_removed,you know whats older home video game consoles put another way the only reason ive even touched an xbox one is because my fiftyone year old dad bought himself one i think he broke top on one of the cod games recently
hiphopheads,not_removed,im all for them getting some cash like this especially when they give away their music for free
hiphopheads,not_removed,i remember everyone circlejerking over the albums when they came out and now i see people hating on them all the time i was making a comment on hhh not rtj
hiphopheads,not_removed,when some of your favorite collab with one of your favorite companies
hiphopheads,not_removed,im on hhh all the time and honestly i dont think ive ever seen rtj hate all ive seen is a ton of praise tbh damn haha now youve turned my world upside like who the hell hates rtj xd
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive seen a few comments here and there saying all the bars sound the same likewise with beats hot trash comments tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,now i wanna hear this too
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,god i hate that stupid dance everybody that takes videos does and pouts out their lips
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks

hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,still look at other pictures of
hiphopheads,not_removed,that shirt is so fucking pleb
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have no idea what youre talking about
hiphopheads,not_removed,but he looks that dark in all the other shots in the music video
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean that is obviously what is happening
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn this is such an well produced track ariana sounds fab as usual i dont think i hear pharrell is that calvin as the background vocals but thug stole this track im so impressed to see how much hes grown into his own
hiphopheads,not_removed,young thug god
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,really damn why would she fuck up her check like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,the dude in this intro has stuck with me for the longest time
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats dope i like it
hiphopheads,not_removed,december lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,stroke my cactus
hiphopheads,not_removed,man astroworld is gonna be rodeo which is a great thing i loved birds dont get me wrong but rodeo is a masterpiece
hiphopheads,not_removed,stroke my deet deet
hiphopheads,not_removed,been known since before birds
hiphopheads,not_removed,shouts out to travis for putting out an albummixtape every year since i really enjoy the whole once a year release pattern it lets the album get plenty of attention while also keeping your buzz up year round without over saturating your sound also if he handles cruel winter as well as i think he can then his sales numbers are going to be insane for astroworld im predicting first week even though rodeo did and birds did
hiphopheads,not_removed,rodeo or days before rodeo decisions decisions
hiphopheads,not_removed,so we just gonna forget that he just announced a tour
hiphopheads,not_removed,more like deet deet hours
hiphopheads,not_removed,so so soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh we stil waiting on him to finish lcrc which he has been working on for over a year and now he has an album on the way smh i just hope its better than birds
hiphopheads,not_removed,rip astroworld
hiphopheads,not_removed,here we go again
hiphopheads,not_removed,hopefully that thug feature yeah yeah is on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,in travis scott time is
hiphopheads,not_removed,im expecting this shit on september or rodeo and birds both dropped on the first friday of september
hiphopheads,not_removed,aye man this dude work ethic is on point
hiphopheads,not_removed,if hes able to deliver an album like rodeo with nonstop bangers again ill be very happy
hiphopheads,not_removed,i am a huge travis fan but i wish hed push it back a year rodeo took years to perfect and birds was sloppily put together in one
hiphopheads,not_removed,left cheek right cheek
hiphopheads,not_removed,when tho sooner than you think be ready drops in november
hiphopheads,not_removed,good hope he takes his time with it
hiphopheads,not_removed,this comment never fails
hiphopheads,not_removed,can someone fill me in
hiphopheads,not_removed,straight up
hiphopheads,not_removed,as much as travis delays hes good for dropping a project on a yearly basis
hiphopheads,not_removed,what lets you know what its going to sound like honestly curious not trying to be a dickhead
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope he goes back to the more atmospheric harder hitting dark fast tempo music that he did on days before rodeo thats the only travis project i can really sit through and enjoy travis for me is pretty good at making really atmospheric dark party music but rodeo just seemed like a student trying to lengthen an essay i guess like there were good parts in it but then he overdid it on every song and it ended up being kind of boring and unnecessary
hiphopheads,not_removed,rodeo is a masterpeice eh
hiphopheads,not_removed,rodeo is a masterpiece lmaoooo since when
hiphopheads,not_removed,lit meme
hiphopheads,not_removed,hell probably sell copies at least im thinking
hiphopheads,not_removed,both are totally different projects
hiphopheads,not_removed,he alluded to one a while back on his snapchat this is just confirmation
hiphopheads,not_removed,deet deet years
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty sure lcrc has been done for a while but hes waiting to release it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think he should save it for astroworld esp if jeremihs gonna be on it i think they can do a maria im drunk type thing with it you know like when the drunk leak came out it was pretty catchy but on rodeo he polished and added justin bieber and make a sick intro hope he does that with lcrc
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep has to be quarter
hiphopheads,not_removed,dre never even dropped detox
hiphopheads,not_removed,the biggest liarbullshitter of all time in hip hop him lupe and nas gotta be the biggest i can see a quarter if we get turbo grafxcruel winterking push in the first theres no way hed want to be in the midst of them but tbh i can only see king push actually coming out then
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait are emojis banned theyre so cute tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,risky
hiphopheads,not_removed,imma say worth it on this one
hiphopheads,not_removed,rip
hiphopheads,not_removed,travis says that on birds
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep just dont expect this project this until the end of around quarter no matter what he says
hiphopheads,not_removed,so so soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,best part about this meme is that i was there when he said it and i was hella confused and i didnt realize he actually said deetdeet
hiphopheads,not_removed,deet deet decades
hiphopheads,not_removed,astroworld was announced at the same time as birds sound like travis is putting more work into it and it will sound like more of a perfected project like rodeo
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres also a tweet if traviss where he says something around the lines of every year astroworld was destroyed more and more so the rodeos has more room or something like that also the snippets of songs that may be on it are more rodeoey than bittsmish
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk the name astroworld just give me that feeling that its gonna have a synthy feel its the perfect name for a travis project i feel like travis put out birds really quickly just to gain some more hype to the mainstream it even went dont get me wrong birds is a great album but the production is not on the level of rodeo and dbr as for op its about tied i could be wrong though haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,well in the same way he made dbr while also working on hard on rodeo and dbr was kinda just fun songs whereas rodeo is sone really good shit he started making birds while working on astro world so astroworld will likely be the better more refined project whereas birds was the fun quickly made songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,he also marketed birds as a tape and this is gonna be an official album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like he overdid it in a good way though the songs are so maximalist and indulgent its what makes me love the album the ridiculously long outro on the beat switches super layered production varied song structures etc i can see why some might not like that though dbr is a lot more stripped back which is nice in its own way but i love that rodeo is so grand in comparison
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn i think he really progressed as an artist on rodeo but i can respect you not liking it and thinking dbr is better its a great project dbr was very raw and dark but it def was not party music except sloppy toppy maybe i feel like he polished his sound and made some gorgeous music
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought birds was very dark and grimy i didnt get the hate for it but it definitely wasnt as good as rodeo
hiphopheads,not_removed,masterpiece might be a stretch but its pretty fucking good
hiphopheads,not_removed,how is days before just not mentioned here far superior album for me at least and i liked birds over rodeo although i think many would discount me for that
hiphopheads,not_removed,im just telling you what i think you dont have to agree though
hiphopheads,not_removed,for real there are like songs you could take off there and nothing of value would be lost
hiphopheads,not_removed,yet they are both incredible
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah could do without backyard haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,deet deet decades
hiphopheads,not_removed,you clearly were not here during the dark days of emojis beginning nothing but flames and emojis as far as this board could see
hiphopheads,not_removed,its on through the late night isnt it
hiphopheads,not_removed,deet deet hours neverforget
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes thats also what i mean thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,a lot of times labels require artists to have an album complete not released every six months whilst on their on contract my theory is birds was the album to fulfill that contractual obligation and his main vision is really on astroworld
hiphopheads,not_removed,soo like freddie gibbs and piñata right he made shadow of a doubt with a different sound as piñata before releasing bandana or piñata
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn that sounds like a cool quote what are the snippets
hiphopheads,not_removed,astroworld was the name of an amusement park in houston near the astrodome that closed about years ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,yepppp
hiphopheads,not_removed,rodeo is the like the epitome of luxury trap its so gorgeous everything you mentioned is on point
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i dont know i could see how people like it if youre into that kind of sound but for me im only really interested in it unless theres a lot of emotion in the production like there was on dbr and because it seems like the songs just kind of stretch out in exchange for some more complicated songs productionwise it sucks some of that emotion that was in dbr that i really liked listening to
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont mean in like a generic party music way i guess its the high tempo type of music i like to listen to while im fucked up and chilling with friends while the music on rodeo i cant really do that at all except for maybe a couple songs it just feels fauxgrand with no aim and more drugged out sorta i just dont feel it at all and if travis went back to some kind of more violent and harder music like i felt was on dbr id probably be more interested i liked birds enough but some of it wasnt good and the stuff i did like was still a little bit too drugged out and travis didnt sound as hungry when he did rap
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think it was more for the mainstream great album though only songs id put as dark and grimy would be coordinate sdp interlude outside through the late night rest was pretty upbeathype
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was still pretty drugged out and aimless similar to rodeo than it was dbr it was like if rodeo had more catchy songs and little less complicated songs but the performances felt the same
hiphopheads,not_removed,which songs do you think i like them all
hiphopheads,not_removed,rodeo was the best project of other than tpab
hiphopheads,not_removed,what thats my favorite travis song
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,deet deet deet
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep
hiphopheads,not_removed,what does deet mean
hiphopheads,not_removed,reference
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol be ready to be dissapointed
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats exciting
hiphopheads,not_removed,he released it
hiphopheads,not_removed,to say shadow of a doubt is a different sound isnt accurate shadow of a doubt is closer to his bfk style but before pinata he also had projects like the one with statik selektah gibbs is just diverse like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,just know these songs arent confirmed on astroworld and they are kind of old pre bittsm this is forgive me left cheek right cheek i know ktt has a thread with all of the newer trav snippets too but i cant find it but heres an older semiupdated thread with some of them
hiphopheads,not_removed,awesome that makes it even cooler since he always rep houston
hiphopheads,not_removed,it closed in bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,id say watch the throne is the epitome of luxury rap its just ridiculously grandiose and massive but i see where youre coming from rodeo is easily my favorite travis project the production is gorgeous i even have it in my record collection sounds great only negative is the bonus tracks arent on there
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe controversial but id put rodeo over tpab personally as good as tpab was it didnt stick in my rotation like rodeo did
hiphopheads,not_removed,wild
hiphopheads,not_removed,if were going back to drakes album beats both in terms of replayability despite tpab being a way more quality body of work something about if youre reading this i just couldnt stop playing it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love dbr but i have to admit its kind of a low point on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,it means a couple months
hiphopheads,not_removed,at a concert after multiple delays travis said birds in deet deet hours only in didnt come out due to another delay
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen you little jaded boy dont ruin it for them come on
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah travis makes good music
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,i get what you say but i was talking about piñata
hiphopheads,not_removed,weird i very clearly remember it closing when i was maybe my parents just told me that cause it was expensive and they didnt want to take me anymore
hiphopheads,not_removed,he said rodeo is luxury trap not luxury rap i agree w both of u fyi wtt is epitome luxury rap and rodeo is epitome of luxury trap
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with you rodeo was on straight repeat for me for most of
hiphopheads,not_removed,they are both masterpieces in their own way and different types of music i think they both took the best parts of their subgenres and created something amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,we all thought it was deet deet but maybe it was
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol for sure but astro will sound nothing like rodeo and youll be dissapointed
hiphopheads,not_removed,i misread it only slept hours cuz of adderall and im off pills so yeah my apologies both are great albums that are always in my rotation when i need a cheering up
hiphopheads,not_removed,its still on repeat for me one of my favorite albums of all time
hiphopheads,not_removed,tpab is a better album for sure but it didnt get as much plays from me because the tracks work better in a whole album than as individuals rodeo got played more because a lot of the tracks work better on their own
hiphopheads,not_removed,tpab just wasnt for me alla and rodeo were probably my favourites tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah ive liked all of traviss projects birds too but birds was a commercial mixtape and hes been working on astroworld even before birds i believe so if it doesnt like rodeo it will still have the same quality
hiphopheads,not_removed,same i bought the cd and hung up the poster you get with it
hiphopheads,not_removed,alla goddam that album was amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey i hope you get your wish
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks man
hiphopheads,not_removed,curry is one dude that deserves what hes got and more
hiphopheads,not_removed,can you imagine as a woman pinchin a loaf when suddenly denzel explodes from the ceiling head first i am the one dont weigh a ton
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah this dude is the definition of hardcore
hiphopheads,not_removed,finished the song after busting his head what a guy
hiphopheads,not_removed,photo of the damages to the bathroom in question i think yoshi and him climbed the wall because there were some annoying fans in the crowd who kept bothering him
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck i hope curry is ok
hiphopheads,not_removed,he must have been on a mean adrenaline rush for him to finish off his song after taking a massive knock what a beast
hiphopheads,not_removed,god bless his knotty head
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol i went to a denzel curry earlier in the year that was less than and everyone was fucking wild including denzel even though it wasnt his only show of the day it seems like he gets more hype the smaller the crowd is gotta respect it
hiphopheads,not_removed,reminds me of a hard core punk rocker too dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn thats crazy i just caught his show last night and it was pretty hype
hiphopheads,not_removed,the show was completely insane moshing with denzel right in front of you rapping his ass off is absolutely amazing im really glad hes ok though and he finished ultimate like a savage
hiphopheads,not_removed,was it really worth it i think so
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn obviously it sucks he got hurt but as a cane this story makes me love him even more the u
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah curry has always been a dope rapper i knew he was gonna blow up when i use to hear him on raider klan tracks
hiphopheads,not_removed,saw him in pawtucket ri last week and the man has an insane energy about him got in the crowd and rapped his songs threw people off the stage etc his energy is unmatched by anyone ive ever seen and its crazy that hed finish ultimate after a display like that i hope the best for him
hiphopheads,not_removed,hope he comes out of this all right one of the brightest young talents of today and ive been very lucky to see him live several times a great performer as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,that shits metal as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,finished ultimate ultimate as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was just talking with my girl about celebrities dying that i would be sad about he was one of them holy fuck im glad hes okay his career hasnt even nearly reached his full potential i remember at one of his shows i went to i was like youre the best rapper alive and he said nah but im the best me alive i was candy flipping and my mind was blown
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn im in knoxville and wish i wouldve went its a little surprising to hear he didnt have more than people though
hiphopheads,not_removed,glad he is okay i need denzel alive and healthy so i can continue to be selfish and devour more music we need you denzel
hiphopheads,not_removed,savage
hiphopheads,not_removed,i can confirm his shows are fucking crazy never seen so much energy transfer to the crowd i went to his show only after hearing how good they were and i listened to one song before i went and right now its my favorite show ive been to by a long shot
hiphopheads,not_removed,i blame tory lanez
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit i just saw him in nc a couple nights ago someone hopped on stage and dove into the crowd and after the song he almost hopped off stage and got in a fight with the guy currys intense and it was a hell of a show really hope hes okay
hiphopheads,not_removed,saw him in nc shit was wild and he talked to a bunch of his fans at the merch booth after hope hes alright and shoutout to yoshi
hiphopheads,not_removed,hiphop is becoming metal af
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats some tupac shit right there hope he gets better cause i want some new records curry
hiphopheads,not_removed,guess you could say he was a bit knotty headed
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn i didnt know his shows got that wild not surprised but shout to that nigga im glad hes aight
hiphopheads,not_removed,im jealous you got to see him
hiphopheads,not_removed,im supposed to catch his show in miami next week hope hes alright
hiphopheads,not_removed,most likely concussed glad hes aight
hiphopheads,not_removed,needs to remember he isnt super sayain
hiphopheads,not_removed,this man must think hes solid snake or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,god wants him to keep on grinding amen to this
hiphopheads,not_removed,im going to see denzel today at in atlanta will this effect the show
hiphopheads,not_removed,man thankfully thats all it is was expecting you to say somebody stabbed him or something when he was moshing in the crowd
hiphopheads,not_removed,obviously his health is most important but i wonder if he is gonna be stuck with the bill for the damages he caused
hiphopheads,not_removed,as i was leaving the venue last night i saw him in the ambulance and he threw up the u through the windowlegendary
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was running the lights for this show and had several observations to share he did spend most of the night in the crowd but these two guys were really turnt up and were getting on his nerves so at one point he had everyone circle around him to straight keep those two dude from being able to get up next to him but it was hype as fuck and everyone in the crowd was having a great time towards the end of his show he started moving around he entire dance floor and the mob would follow wherever he went there was a table next to the wall in question and he and yoshi quickly hopped up on top of it and checked to see if it looked solid about the time they look at each other to confirm how solid it looked our production manager was next to me on his radio telling security to get him down from there but about the time he finished his sentence curry had scaled the wall and flipped head first into the bathroom below it was like a scene from a movie everything went silent as security rushed into the bathroom to see if he was ok everyone was in shock after a few minutes you hear a micd up curry saying im ok yo spin that shit to which the dj replied erm what shit then curry was like yo that ultimate shit then he performed that shit like a boss announced one more time that he was ok then made his way backstage
hiphopheads,not_removed,curry is that fucking dude hes got the best live performances
hiphopheads,not_removed,wtf less than my nigga deserves a lot more attention than other wackass rappers
hiphopheads,not_removed,so glad i get to see him in november hope hes ok but he sounds like a hell of a performer live
hiphopheads,not_removed,no videos
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope hes able to perform tonight in atl
hiphopheads,not_removed,rockstar
hiphopheads,not_removed,dope story
hiphopheads,not_removed,he posted on his insta that hes cool
hiphopheads,not_removed,i am the one dont weigh a ton dont need a gun to get respect up on crash boom musicstops
hiphopheads,not_removed,goat
hiphopheads,not_removed,my heart dropped when i saw this post im trying to see this dude on saturday i hope hes okay
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope hes okay but that wouldve been one of the dopest things ever to see in person
hiphopheads,not_removed,he was bumpin too hard
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely he was super cool dapping everyone up and jumping around with his fans while rapping his ass off for sure one of my favorites of this generation
hiphopheads,not_removed,i read this initially as he deserved to fall in his head
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit are you reaaaally that mtv made guy mistook someone else on this sub for you earlier this year lol edit something tells me hes not
hiphopheads,not_removed,absolutely if you look at his discography hes been making quality music for a pretty long time and deserves everything hes gotten so far
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy fuck im dead rip me funniest mental image
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhmudvmiitou
hiphopheads,not_removed,memeing
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmaoooo
hiphopheads,not_removed,i made it
hiphopheads,not_removed,id give you gold if i could afford to funniest thing ive read all night hahahahhahahahaha
hiphopheads,not_removed,punk is alive through hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw him last night in charlottesville it was so dope yoshi and him are so so so dope i wish him all the best and sorry it happened
hiphopheads,not_removed,one of my friends was right next to him while he was moshing the snapchat vidoes looked like it was an awesome show
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont getcha head bust nigga
hiphopheads,not_removed,that guys like i should quit i dont want to clean this fucking shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,imagine changing your tampon and then having denzel curry crash through the roof lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,denzel should make this his next album cover
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn hes about to get a check lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah man its delicious try it
hiphopheads,not_removed,ultimate got him so pumped that it saved his life lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,same here went to a show of his in london last summer and there werent more than people in the room but the energy in the room was crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,crazy to me that his shows are so empty
hiphopheads,not_removed,same bro shit was nuts i came from richmond to see him no chance i was gonna miss him
hiphopheads,not_removed,ay man shoutout to the u we out here
hiphopheads,not_removed,candy flipping does this just mean you were off the candy or flipping it as in selling
hiphopheads,not_removed,yooo i was there the crowd wouldnt let him up before he hopped on he shoved this tiny indian dude into me and flipped me off i was dying laughing watching him get his ass beat
hiphopheads,not_removed,yoshi was wearing my friends jacket during the performance and hung with us afterwards it was hype as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo how was the merch
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably not he just said on twitter that hes going twice as hard today
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely know what you mean he was taking a chance being on the floor with everyone
hiphopheads,not_removed,i witnessed him punch someone square in the face for hopping on stage as he was trying to perform lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,which venue in knoxville was he at
hiphopheads,not_removed,he killed it when i saw him
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah thats me
hiphopheads,not_removed,you dont need to picture it no more
hiphopheads,not_removed,excellent use of the volume there
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think the movie dope did a really good job touching on the overlap of punk and hip hop culture
hiphopheads,not_removed,saw him in boston sunday night yoshi split the crowd with his staff like moses and walked through and then moshed with us like it was his fucking job which i guess it was
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao the staff definitely wasnt amused one of them had to pull yoshi down from the wall
hiphopheads,not_removed,super late but apparently my manager called me once to tell me that curry actually went through our drive thru like he was hyped but i asked he took a pic turns out he wasnt there but someone who was working took his order and forgot to take a pic in the heat of the moment all in my day off
hiphopheads,not_removed,come on dad
hiphopheads,not_removed,sold out in chi when i saw him
hiphopheads,not_removed,candy flipping is when you mix lsd and mdma
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey ivey
hiphopheads,not_removed,he posted it on his ig i got the hoodie for and its nice as fuck also a neat zine there
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean that was pretty shitty of the attendee to do
hiphopheads,not_removed,further proves how great he is
hiphopheads,not_removed,most rappers do
hiphopheads,not_removed,reminds me of when earl did something similar shit had me dying
hiphopheads,not_removed,the concourse at the international its right beside the actual international
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i bet after taking a ten foot fall on their head theyd do some pussy shit like go directly to the hospital
hiphopheads,not_removed,you can enjoy his work without being a whiny cunt
hiphopheads,not_removed,man you being downvoted speaks volumes for this sub
hiphopheads,not_removed,its an opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn your episode is one of the few i never forgot that may be because of your name alone
hiphopheads,not_removed,missed opportunity
hiphopheads,not_removed,eh took min to make in vegas worth
hiphopheads,not_removed,god dam those dreads looking hella smokeable b
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree i listen to both and theres definitely an overlap the new danny brown album i noticed definitely has some punk aspects its sick
hiphopheads,not_removed,how i didnt get anything punk from that movie apart from how the kids randomly were in a pop punk band
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh hey bud
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not defending the guy that jumped up there i was with curry on that one
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was standing front row so i saw it right in front of me guy ran by me actually and i saw it unfold into one of the funniest things ive ever witnessed
hiphopheads,not_removed,but then how will he feel superior
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah how dare the user base here want nothing more than to diverge from the modern day version of dae real rap guiz its fine that you dont like the modern contemporaries of rap but there are hundreds of ways to voice that better than he did
hiphopheads,not_removed,he stated it as a fact and i gave my own opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,i did it the other way first since he was mid performance lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,hol up i got you
hiphopheads,not_removed,same and i agree with you as well seeing overlap of genres like this is pretty dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,musically or in terms of attitude i see the danny resemblance but im wondering what the resemblance is between the two genres in general
hiphopheads,not_removed,ya those kids were in a punk rock band for absolutely no reason lmao dope is still such garbage
hiphopheads,not_removed,says the dude who literally just pulled the le mumble rap argument go back to bed its clearly too early on a friday for you
hiphopheads,not_removed,what youre saying would make since if the music in question wasnt a horrendous joke
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think he has to preface everything with imo if its clearly an opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,these will never not be funny to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,it is stuff like death grips and is basically punkrap too which is fucking sick i love this crossover so many people i know who like hardcore also love hiphop and i definitely understand why
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok i have a fucking sick example check this out just got announced today httpimgurcomwumqioo so youve got lil peep lil ugly mane spooky black antwon and wikiplaying with fuckin jesus piece xixalba red death etc in case you didnt know them last are like insanely heavy hardcore punkbeatdown bands who are sharing a lineup with all these sick hip hop artists its been building for a few years now but shows like this and tours such as trash talk x ratking pretty much show how the line between new hip hop artists and the punkhardcore scene has been blurred and i really cant wait to see more lineups shows like this its so cool
hiphopheads,not_removed,it does make sense because youre not the one who gets to determine what is and isnt a horrendous joke and im quite frankly tired of this busted false rhetoric learn how to articulate your criticisms without sounding like a goddamn youtube comment and maybe people will listen to you
hiphopheads,not_removed,alright sorry its my opinion imperial isnt aoty
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn camron is gonna be there too thats huge
hiphopheads,not_removed,why do you like it edit i bet those youtube comments are more intellectual than what it is were talking about
hiphopheads,not_removed,ill let it slide
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea boi looks absolutely sick so yeah thats how punk and hip hop are idkbecomingmore closely associated i guess and as for danny brown yeah i meant in attitude the pits at his shows are wild and likehis vocals on handstand wouldnt be out of place in a hardcore song at times hes very punk in style imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,because i think it sounds good why dont you like it
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh i get it this is the part where you totally roast me for liking music you dont well sorry dude im not having this conversation i never even said i like current hiphoprap anyway lol not that its any of your business in this context youre just begging for someone to debate you on it though i see all i said was not to be stereotypically isolationist in your music interests think you can pull that off
hiphopheads,not_removed,ill answer i guess i kinda like it when im in a car with friends i wanna bang with some easy to listen to music with good beats i dont wanna listen to brendas got a baby or u when i wanna have a good time its safe and something most people can vibe with
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you
hiphopheads,not_removed,man i had one comment on the whole thread so chill i aint defending shit lol i consider the mumble rap stuff to be like mcdonalds its aight and gets the job done i enjoy it for the simplicity but it cant hold a candle to the likes of a fine restaraunt kendrick frank earl
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe cause ur bashing someones music choice the fuck kinda question is this edit nvm not u
hiphopheads,not_removed,working for me on apple music

hiphopheads,not_removed,posted on youtube days ago what do you guys think i think this is cool new school style with the grime influences kinda like rtj in style but the video is more like a lady gaga music vid i havent done much research but it could even be the same cinematographer
hiphopheads,not_removed,can we slow down a bit my head is throbbing harder than my dick
hiphopheads,not_removed,gibbs kenny logic im not going to work today i need to get my mind right
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is the best song on the destructo ep the pusha t song was good too but this beats it
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk why but its not the same version as was posted earlier it sounds like someone put it in garageband and boosted the pitch correction all the way up
hiphopheads,not_removed,i against i genghis khan blood runs cold
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont forget razorblade salvation
hiphopheads,not_removed,design in malice
hiphopheads,not_removed,deer hunter
hiphopheads,not_removed,art inspired by shia labeouf andrea arnold bruce springsteen and shirts you could purchase from gas stations in texas from kevins twitter
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea people are definitely gonna hate that cover lmfao not really a fan myself but i think it might grow on me kevins artwork is usually fuckin tight i dont understand what happened with this one
hiphopheads,not_removed,im so fuckin excited for this empty and echo have been on constant rotation allamericantrash was amazing i wanna see if he can top
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck yall that cover is dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,cover is terrible
hiphopheads,not_removed,this cover doesnt even work as satire its just straight up ugly for someone with such a great sense of aesthetic he managed to fuck this up so bad lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,i guess he changed his mind again
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk man i love the album cover it fits ians whole artistic direction aesthetic very well
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,that cover is not bad by any means
hiphopheads,not_removed,not super feeling the cover but empty and echo are on it so happy he didnt take them off
hiphopheads,not_removed,excited to hear this did anyone manage to rip his interview on no jumper before it got took down id love to seehear it if possible
hiphopheads,not_removed,kind think kevin is overhyped great branding so far but the music isnt quite there yet imo this album cover is really out of line with the aesthetic though step back for kevin hk on that front
hiphopheads,not_removed,god damn that cover is garbage
hiphopheads,not_removed,hoping the boys over at rfreshalbumart cook up something fresh for this
hiphopheads,not_removed,usually hk does the art and its always dope as fuck but the cover is by tyler mitchell also very talented but thats why its different i like it i think it fits to be honest
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like he almost definitely will based off what weve heard from the album im really excited too
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah thats why im surprised he normally has a nice sense of style
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude i guess he did lmao good to see those tracks are on the album i was a bit worried
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like thats the point also why are you addressing op like hes kevin lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,hk is good i think its intentional
hiphopheads,not_removed,those guys are crazy talented i bet they will
hiphopheads,not_removed,you saw further down the thread
hiphopheads,not_removed,ill try to make a cover if i have any time left this evening
hiphopheads,not_removed,tyler mitchell is the photographer the art was designed by hk and kevin
hiphopheads,not_removed,same but lets be real when it comes out all the tracks will be different new cover art and new album name
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey its me ur kev
hiphopheads,not_removed,i actually did not see one that was that good ami missing something
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats nice as fuck thats definitely what imma be using thanks homie let me save ur comment before i forget
hiphopheads,not_removed,would be much appreciated
hiphopheads,not_removed,wasnt it death of a supermodel then they shoot horses when did he decide to change it to american boyfriend
hiphopheads,not_removed,some of them are really good the httpiimgurcomyyvzldspng fan cover is a million times better it certainly has some great stuff in there
hiphopheads,not_removed,what kevin abstract songsprojects would you recommend i only listened to the brockhampton tape
hiphopheads,not_removed,the brockhampton was great id say start with if you wanna get into him
hiphopheads,not_removed,tom jones whats new pussycat
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha yeah man staywoke
hiphopheads,not_removed,hopsin is too mainstream now i liked him when he only had subscribers and wore his shoes backwards like me
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,im so dead op thanks for ending my year off on a high note
hiphopheads,not_removed,this a troll post hopsin is trash
hiphopheads,not_removed,yall wilding hopsin is whack
hiphopheads,not_removed,did the hopsin who invented rap go to college
hiphopheads,not_removed,did the man who invented college go to college
hiphopheads,not_removed,daaaaaaaaaaamn
hiphopheads,not_removed,smooth 👌🏽
hiphopheads,not_removed,the fuck is your title lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a test
hiphopheads,not_removed,i failed
hiphopheads,not_removed,saying andre is the greatest emcee is an understatement
hiphopheads,not_removed,lit
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is fucking hot
hiphopheads,not_removed,love the part where he raps she hot as hell lets call her helen
hiphopheads,not_removed,views untitled unmastered coloring book the life of pablo blank face lp malibu views gonna win tho and well all be sad
hiphopheads,not_removed,views tlop islah blank face lp bittsm coloring book if albums that are only streamable can be nominated
hiphopheads,not_removed,for rap album of the year definite nominees views which will win almost guaranteed coloring book the life of pablo possible untitled unmastered blank face malibu atrocity exhibition this unruly mess ive made prima donna ep
hiphopheads,not_removed,blank face and still brazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,why is no one mentioning geazys album
hiphopheads,not_removed,definites drake views kanye west the life of pablo probable chance the rapper coloring book macklemore ryan lewis this unruly mess ive made
hiphopheads,not_removed,major key views life of pablo untitled unmastered islah and i could see tde switching out untitled unmastered to give blank face a spot but views is going to win with major key being place i wouldnt be surprised if major key wins actually khaled was on a bunch of late night talk shows this year and theres a high chance a big chunk of the grammy committee has children that talk about dj khaled and snapchat which will equate to making the committee think dj khaleds music is really popping like that the grammys doesnt reward music it rewards music marketing your optimism will die slowly
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah its the worst on that list so its gotta win lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,doubt danny and vince would be on there
hiphopheads,not_removed,because its a good album but a lot of people dont take him that seriously for some reason
hiphopheads,not_removed,vince was nominated last year i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,just play work remix then ignition remix or so times
hiphopheads,not_removed,deleted
hiphopheads,not_removed,the best part of this album is that the introspective rnbgospel tinged tracks dont feel out of place amongst the expected stormzy tracks like big for your boots and cold i wasnt expecting this out of a debut from stormzy but im not disappointed either definitely wanna see what his followup will be like considering hes only
hiphopheads,not_removed,too low if you ask me first time i listened to stormzy though
hiphopheads,not_removed,if anything the rating isnt high enough incredible album with massive versatility whilst remaining cohesive as well as smashing every style he tried easily my most listen to album in at least a year would recommend everyone buylisten
hiphopheads,not_removed,in the past few months ive listen to the albums from skepta wiley and this album from stormzy all albums are different as i felt skepta came with the hard hitting but radio friendly grimeimo wiley felt even more hard hitting but a lot less radio friendly this album by stormzy has a bit of that radio appeal that skepta put on his album but instead of the hard hitting raps its more vocals and singing he also has some hard hitting grime
hiphopheads,not_removed,bad boys on heavy rotation yea
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is rly dope do you think you could make the loganlikesmusic watermark a lot smaller tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean it was ok but this dude could use a better mic and the mixing was subpar

hiphopheads,not_removed,killed this shit phresher not so much imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,banger tbh so the flies dont come was one of my fav albums of last year
hiphopheads,not_removed,love this track and souvenir
hiphopheads,not_removed,this came out late in the year if i remember correctly and still made my year in spotify
hiphopheads,not_removed,i can tell
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey man i put together a jazzymellow playlist that has a ton of artists you can check out
hiphopheads,not_removed,is pretty chill idk if you wanna call it rap or not but its good sam lachow is chill the old mac miller

hiphopheads,not_removed,hodgy beats
hiphopheads,not_removed,isaiah rashads great for mellow viber music check out suns tirade
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah you can create them and follow others you just cant listen to any song at any time
hiphopheads,not_removed,still digging this whole ep so heavily imo playin fair is the worst song on it and that shit still goes crazy production is sooooo good and towkio knows exactly what to do with it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt make this album myself but this is my friends second ep and i thought rhiphopheads might enjoy i think its pretty damn good for amateur hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,man this is really good i think if this was professionally mixed i assume it isnt that you could really be on to something here good work
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait a second why does big say blow up like the world trade
hiphopheads,not_removed,updated the list added some new stuff
hiphopheads,not_removed,there was a bombing scare in the wtc parking lot in the early so a decade before the wtc was already being used in bars like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,ohh thanks i thought i would finally prove to my friends the occult forces are up to something
hiphopheads,not_removed,other way around quavo ft party
hiphopheads,not_removed,i honestly prefer quavo to any of the other migos i hope he releases a solo project
hiphopheads,not_removed,quavo has been killing it this year with all his solo features hope we get a solo project from him some day
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel so bad for takeoff and offset theyre not getting any shinebut quavo has been killing it lately
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like this over the yachty track tbh granted i just hopped onto the yachty train like a week ago this just sounds more consistent and easier to get into
hiphopheads,not_removed,murda smooth on the beat programs
hiphopheads,not_removed,murda beatz has lowkey been putting out some heat lately back on road no shopping like dat buzzin and this
hiphopheads,not_removed,soundcloud mirror httpssoundcloudcommigosatlquavoftpartynextdoorcuffedupprodmurda
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is hot as fuck why post this trash link though op direct audiomack link
hiphopheads,not_removed,my two favorite feature artists cant wait to give this a listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,autotuned up
hiphopheads,not_removed,offset and takeoff on suicide watch
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is great love it
hiphopheads,not_removed,wish this was longer
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a beautiful song
hiphopheads,not_removed,this shit aint hip hop this shits rap
hiphopheads,not_removed,whys everybody keep thinking partys the main contendor
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like it was partys song until it didnt make then he gave it to quavo
hiphopheads,not_removed,takeoff is fire bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think thats how a lot of people feel he drops more music whether its features than offset and takeoff and is really consistent
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait never rly heard quavo but he a solo artist now from da migos
hiphopheads,not_removed,all his verses have been phenomenal
hiphopheads,not_removed,offset killed his verse with yachty
hiphopheads,not_removed,we in a producer era of hip hop now
hiphopheads,not_removed,uhhhh what
hiphopheads,not_removed,those are the same things
hiphopheads,not_removed,bro i feel you tha culture changin and they aint tha same anymore
hiphopheads,not_removed,because quavo doesnt release a lot of solo music
hiphopheads,not_removed,because hes got an album coming out soon and people were hoping these tracks would be on said album
hiphopheads,not_removed,personally offset is my favorite but the fact that everyone argues about whos the best member of the group really shows how strong they all are individually
hiphopheads,not_removed,he is still with migos but he is the most active one when not rapping with migos offset only has like features this year and takeoff probably has none outside of migos quavo has a lot of features but he hasnt really done any song that he leads
hiphopheads,not_removed,i heard quavo saying phenomenal in my head from oh my dis side after reading this
hiphopheads,not_removed,phenomenal
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i get that its all preference i still have to really need to give yachty a proper listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk if he was trolling but i do in fact think there is a difference but id never say that here because i would get downvoted into oblivion
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont feed the troll
hiphopheads,not_removed,also is coming up and both song premiered on ovo sound radio which is partys labels radio station
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay sir please dont condescend me or ill have to ask you to leave
hiphopheads,not_removed,ahh i get that
hiphopheads,not_removed,that is true i do like every member of migos but we all have a favorite
hiphopheads,not_removed,yachty and offset got a track together called truck loads
hiphopheads,not_removed,i got shooters dressed in camo
hiphopheads,not_removed,my bad vv
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats actually a legitimate response to your question lmao not condescending at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,he also has a feature on swerve by rich the kid his verse is so good song is crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think hes joking haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,hahaha
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a wack joke
hiphopheads,not_removed,xd
hiphopheads,not_removed,aint as wack as your response man
hiphopheads,not_removed,maggot
hiphopheads,not_removed,talib made some good points in his piece but god damn its just hard to take him truly seriously when he writes over words dedicated to a couple twitter exchanges he had with dumbass rappers
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,my theory on it is that the sort of awful melodic stuff he does is to an extent what gets the most plays these days theres nothing wrong with that as there are guys who do it very well like uzi and thugger and future and whoever but montana isnt one of those guys and id imagine doing the autotune stuff montana does is a lot easier than writing those dense minute songs that are nothing but ridiculously gritty bars and coupling that with the perceived accessibility behind the bad parts of his music the autotune etc it just doesnt lend itself to a good project for him despite it being shown that he gets the most publicity off of his bars and remixes on a personal level i dont think his production is worth the time of day which turns me off from his stuff but thats an apples and oranges thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,i too would love an album with nothing but hard bars from montana but i feel that he wants to give the impression that he can do more than just that which is exactly what he does with his albums he has some drill autotune tracks and we i left out in my opinion i think it is hurting him more than helping him think he should focus on one type first blow up and then try to experiment with different sounds but if it works for him thats good too
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats well thought out it makes sense wish hed just take the time but i get it thanks madlcarus
hiphopheads,not_removed,they wont reminisce over him
hiphopheads,not_removed,til troy ave is
hiphopheads,not_removed,deuce deuce famkarma gon catch up but the album sales wont
hiphopheads,not_removed,you just know hes about to drop terrible mixtapes about how hes the hardest in the streets and a survivor and shit smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,no one will be saying free troy lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,what a weirdo
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,when keeping it real goes wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,they just gave one of bobby shmurdas boys for an attempted murder i wonder whats going to happen with troy fucking embarrassment to ny edit correction bobby shmurdas boy wasnt charged with attempted murder he got charged with actual murder
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats what happens cant say im shocked
hiphopheads,not_removed,so did joey take home the dub in this beef
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes getting the shmurda treatment
hiphopheads,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment troy for the uneducated great track from a great album by a great group whaaat what about chief rocka that was my favorite one i love that song but it sounds really similar to lupes freedom aint enough i hope these guys arent out here stealing things from lupe edit heres my proof this is a pretty good song im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf
hiphopheads,not_removed,sounds like hes going to bring the feeling back to rikers island
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck it we dont love em blat
hiphopheads,not_removed,people on this sub celebrate gucci coming home and post free bobby shmurda but call this guy a piece of shit for shooting someone is this because he dissed some rappers dead homie
hiphopheads,not_removed,wonder what really happened that night
hiphopheads,not_removed,committed career suicide and made ny better
hiphopheads,not_removed,so he got shot by somebody wtf i thought everyone said he shot himself idk what id do with a bullet in my leg pumping my adrenaline with a pistol on me not sure if anyone in the sub would know judge away i guess no sense of empathy only rage from a fucking line in a diss track
hiphopheads,not_removed,yikes
hiphopheads,not_removed,goodbye forever fucking punk
hiphopheads,not_removed,piece of shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,god even when troy average tries to murder someone its attempted
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,troy ave would never win
hiphopheads,not_removed,why do people keep putting taxs name in this is there actually a source or is it just gossipspeculation
hiphopheads,not_removed,free troy ave
hiphopheads,not_removed,lawyers stressed that he had no criminal record i swear rappers are the best comedians nowadays
hiphopheads,not_removed,nobody careessssss
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn this is still so shocking to me scary out here in nyc
hiphopheads,not_removed,free troy
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay multiple things first troy ave is in his thirties and still hasnt learned any better second the motherfucker accomplished nothing but getting his own bodyguard killed and third he actually had the audacity to claim that hes the victim in the scenario part of me doesnt wanna get mad at troy simply because i dont really know his background when people grow up in fucked up environments it becomes the norm their whole reality is altered and shit like this starts to seem valid to them because its the only way they know how to handle things i mean i was almost convinced that selling crack was gonna be a great thing for me at one point in time so i understand thankfully i didnt do it for the record but god damn i went from not even knowing troy ave existed to being glad hes probably going to prison for a very long time real fucking quick what a shitty scenario allaround
hiphopheads,not_removed,great track from a great album by a great group
hiphopheads,not_removed,an original approach i like it
hiphopheads,not_removed,the sample on that song is number one on my list of favorite samples used
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow haha that was clever
hiphopheads,not_removed,shout out pete rock and cl smooth
hiphopheads,not_removed,my god
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn i had no idea he was that old makes him look even lamer for making fun of a year old that committed suicide
hiphopheads,not_removed,fr i thought he was like or some shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,troy average
hiphopheads,not_removed,but that karma keep clips
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe joey thinks that troy ave is a redditor
hiphopheads,not_removed,how lol hes in jail waiting trial
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe in years
hiphopheads,not_removed,he doesnt have any terrible mixtapes so im not sure why youre od hating on him
hiphopheads,not_removed,you listen with your ears lol dudes got bars
hiphopheads,not_removed,i heard meek mill is is so he just got his first l after a solid winning streak
hiphopheads,not_removed,free troy
hiphopheads,not_removed,free troy
hiphopheads,not_removed,word is troy confronted tax backstage and punched him and there was a big brawl with their crews and taxs boy pulled a gun out and shots rang and hit bangatroy and troys girl
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats the gif from
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think that was for second degree murder
hiphopheads,not_removed,wasnt attempted murder it was years for actual murder
hiphopheads,not_removed,joey took the w as soon as troy even mentioned steez
hiphopheads,not_removed,joey already won with his sway freestyle
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think this has anything to do with joey badass
hiphopheads,not_removed,joeys fan base is all white kids so he wins by default with the population ratio being in his favor
hiphopheads,not_removed,makes sense as nobody actually cares about troy ave himself
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly gucci threw a woman out of a moving car for refusing to blow him thats horrific theyre just being selective because troy he has beef with joey if this was waka i guarantee theyd be outraged
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck that keep all them hooligans in jail and away from normal society fuck legit violent crime and violent criminals
hiphopheads,not_removed,no its because we actually like gucci and shmurda
hiphopheads,not_removed,well the part where he limps into the frame and fires out of it without ducking sure as hell happened
hiphopheads,not_removed,deleted
hiphopheads,not_removed,word on the street is that this whole thing started when troy ave started a fight with taxstone one of taxs boys pulls out a gun fires three shots hitting troy his girl and killing his friend but then drops the gun troy picks it up and goes after them firing two more shots but doesnt hit anyone hes being charged for attempted murder for shooting at someone and reckless endangerment for discharging a weapon in a crowded venue
hiphopheads,not_removed,how does this make ny better hiphop is on thin ice in the eyes of the nypd now good luck to anybody who was planning on hitting up any rap shows in manhattan for the next couple of months they on red alert joey bada recent show was canceled as a result of this especially since it was an actual performer who was caught on tape holding a gun and not just some random wack job this is real fuckin bad for the scene
hiphopheads,not_removed,bar god is that you
hiphopheads,not_removed,heh nothing personnel troy
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah lets free this guy who has attempted to murder a man dont see that backfiring edit pun not intended
hiphopheads,not_removed,what do you mean have the audacity to claim hes the victim all the facts arent out yet and no one really knows what really happened prior to the video lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is one them songs that might get you kicked out of hip hop for not knowing
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song has been following me for the past few days keeps popping up on spotify caught it on the radio somehow and now here i think its a sign to play nba street vol again
hiphopheads,not_removed,now i hear this track and it only reminds me of nba street
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love that song but it sounds really similar to lupes freedom aint enough i hope these guys arent out here stealing things from lupe edit heres my proof
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo mtv raps now thats a name i havent heard in a long time
hiphopheads,not_removed,lots of uneducated kids in here
hiphopheads,not_removed,and extra p for helping with the horns
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes the same age as lil wayne to make it worse
hiphopheads,not_removed,a grown man beefing with dudes in their decides to mock one of their dead homies who they lost in their teens this shit is unfucking real
hiphopheads,not_removed,some people dont grow up and dont get age shit is honestly pathetic to be a grown man and not get where you are age wise shit im and when it comes to some shit i just dont do anymore teenage shit petty conflicts niggas im years away from no way im hanging on front stoops anymore and doing dumb shit like i did at im trying to get my life together make shit work with my girl and worry about my money here you go a grown ass man calling dudes a decade younger than him weirdos dudes who are way more skilled and getting way more exposure and trying to start beef with them dude needs to grow the fuck up i dont know anyone who fucks with troy ave or even know this dude maybe because im from baltimore and new york rap doesnt really flow down here like that unless its rocky or someone closer to the trap sound i know more people who fuck with or at least know of chance and joey badass
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea imma take nyt over google
hiphopheads,not_removed,he should turn this year at least
hiphopheads,not_removed,troy ave aint never gonna win
hiphopheads,not_removed,gucci released like projects from prison troy ave probably has enough material recorded for at least one tape
hiphopheads,not_removed,troy said hateful things then he happened to shoot at people the hate only went up like what
hiphopheads,not_removed,because its the cool thing to do on this forum right now just like robert hold my l was a few months ago itll die down and then youll start seeing free troy posts or dae how amazing troy ave was preprison in the daily discussion its the cycle of this forum
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah man you dont get it these dudes hate him and regardless of it hes got good music or bad theyll still tear it apart and telll him to hold an l just look at the whole meek mill thing its one thing to dislike a rapper or we but to say that they make terrible music when thats objectively false is complete bs
hiphopheads,not_removed,why does he always back the bootiest rappers tyga birdman now troy
hiphopheads,not_removed,looks like is on troys side too
hiphopheads,not_removed,what winning streak
hiphopheads,not_removed,you forgot the part that taxs boy drops the gun and troy picks it up trying to shoot tax which is why all the shots are consistent with his gun but of course this is just word on the street
hiphopheads,not_removed,troy shot himself and the girl that got shot was mainos girl i thought
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah iirc he talked about killing another rival gang member over text to one of his own
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah some times you can be so disrespectful you forfeit see supa ugly for further details
hiphopheads,not_removed,its pretty fucked up but there are some fucked up things that have been said on wax like pac making fun of prodigys sickle cell
hiphopheads,not_removed,can u provide a single fact to back that statement up how many studies been done on the percentage of varying ethnicities buying his concert tickets and albums pls explain
hiphopheads,not_removed,this sub has a lot of impressionable younger kids on here i dont think many of the demographic are going around saying stuff like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,even before the joey beefpeople hated troy thought he was trash and piece of shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,gucci threw a woman out of a moving car for refusing to blow him false equivalency fam i agree that its horrible but its not attempted murder horrible if this was waka i guarantee theyd be outraged i would be surprised if waka did this cause he seems like a decent guy in interviews
hiphopheads,not_removed,so its ok to act like a violent sociopath as long as you make music for fambruhs got it
hiphopheads,not_removed,all around horrible situation i hope he gets a fair trial and gets the appropriate penalty
hiphopheads,not_removed,so it sounds like self defense on troys part he may get some negligent homicide charge or something like that but it wont be full blown murder
hiphopheads,not_removed,why the fuck is taxstone a podcast host walking around beefing with people and having an entourage packing heat
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea no shit but im more interested in what led up to those events
hiphopheads,not_removed,why cant people just read for themselves
hiphopheads,not_removed,because troy ave cant record music or post tweets for awhile so ny hip hop is better now
hiphopheads,not_removed,i too enjoy danny myers
hiphopheads,not_removed,you saying he isnt guy made fun of a who killed himself then gets his friend killed sounds like a piece of shit to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe those are strong words but the fact is he got shot in the leg because of his own bullshit meanwhile another man died one of those things is objectively worse than the other i understand wanting to wait for more facts but i cant really foresee a situation where troy ave suddenly becomes the victim from my understanding he brought a gun into a crowded place then shit popped off its his fault and it really sucks that it happened that way edit for additional clarity even with more information troy ave isnt gonna suddenly seem better if anything taxstone or his people will be pulled down but troy aint coming up he went there and started shit and even if the rumors of the gun belonging to one of taxs people is true troy still retaliated he fought fire with fire and now hes gonna burn i wish none of this shit happened
hiphopheads,not_removed,i knew it from nba street vol
hiphopheads,not_removed,im embarassed about how long it took for me to know that song after getting into hip hop but you know all you can do is spread the messege about amazing classic shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit cya
hiphopheads,not_removed,or if you know shook ones part as the rap battle from mile smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song is how you got girls at college frat parties in
hiphopheads,not_removed,i only knew it from the kanye and chance sampling on how they reminisce over you my god great track none the less
hiphopheads,not_removed,chill out fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,based on the songs context you bout to die fam rip
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah this is insane crazy how people keep stealing from him fuck that band modest mouse or whatever their name is for copying the show goes on
hiphopheads,not_removed,dopeboy freedom aint free
hiphopheads,not_removed,lupe a lil sample vulture and i love it
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre joking right
hiphopheads,not_removed,pete rock and cl smooth are like years earlier dude lupe using that bit is a tribute
hiphopheads,not_removed,where the other doctor dre was at
hiphopheads,not_removed,everybody was an uneducated kid at some point all you cab do is point out how dope older acts like pete rock and cl smooth are classics will speak for themselved
hiphopheads,not_removed,doc are you still fighting the male fashion shills these days
hiphopheads,not_removed,wayne is guess he really is lil
hiphopheads,not_removed,and currensy was a few years above lil wayne at school
hiphopheads,not_removed,shows how booty troy average is the dudes trying to be new new york when the motherfucker was around for the late lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,joeys from nyc
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats cool just letting you know you were giving out wrong info
hiphopheads,not_removed,no hes definitely turning sloppy reporting
hiphopheads,not_removed,one prerecorded tape of new material
hiphopheads,not_removed,guwop already had the verses recorded he just had engineers match them up with beats while he was up state thats why it got weaker and weaker over time because he likely exhausted his entire library of verses lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean the guy has a gucci mane flair
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats some wishful thinking
hiphopheads,not_removed,what the fuck has dude ever released that would be discussed in the future he aint gucci hasnt bought himself the goodwill to go to prison and not have everyone forget about his ass
hiphopheads,not_removed,guaranteed this will happen hes an idiot but i think he had potential
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol the statement troy ave makes terrible music is not objectively false u herb
hiphopheads,not_removed,views being mediocre at best is seen like a win for meek lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,a winning streak of not losing
hiphopheads,not_removed,the last songs and tape he dropped are dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,why would he drop the gun
hiphopheads,not_removed,or more likely troy just isnt going to give a statement saying someone shot him and instead said he shot himself
hiphopheads,not_removed,mans collapses because of a year sentence but hes cool with beating his girl
hiphopheads,not_removed,the fuck did he expect
hiphopheads,not_removed,this vid is always sad but homie deserved it damn
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks homie
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao that sickle cell line always has me dying
hiphopheads,not_removed,camron sayin he was gonna rape nass daughter and piss on her
hiphopheads,not_removed,people swear they want better diss tracks but when troy ave actually comes with something hard all of a sudden hes taken it too far i dont get it
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was the whitest comment that could be written i think my credit score just went up a lil
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably i had a charles manson t shirt when i was a teenager so its not like i can talk
hiphopheads,not_removed,this sub is all white kids who listens to joey bad ass all white kids
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think youre right they get swept up in the circlejerk and just roll with the herd people are afraid to voice a differing opinion because theyll lose fantasy internet points you see that on many subs not just here
hiphopheads,not_removed,im growing more and more convinced daily that this sub is percent white middle class highschoolers
hiphopheads,not_removed,he did kill somebody even if it was in self defense he bragged about it after and he smashed a champagne bottle over a fans head just for asking for a picture the dude is either a complete asshole or mentally ill its not worth it to compare troy ave and guccis charges theyre both bad if gucci was arrested for doing the same thing as troy is accused of im sure the freegucci meme would be back in full effect
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol deadass this is all anyone should say about any situation like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,if the person shooting originally had dropped the gun and troy picked it up and instead of turning around and leaving the situation he decides to fire the gun in a building filled with hundreds of people in small crowded areas that is not self defense that to me sounds like he had the chance to retreat to safety and instead he chose to put countless others lives in danger
hiphopheads,not_removed,more like attempted murder and a charge that has the word reckless or negligent in it
hiphopheads,not_removed,why the fuck is taxstone a podcast host tax is a notorious stick up boy from east ny he is known all around bk and he called out troy ave for being fake and soft and how nobody on troy avenue even fucks with him he continually disses troy ave math hoffa the battle rapper and ebro from hot on his podcast he was and still is connected to the streets although hes trying to get his life together now with the podcast
hiphopheads,not_removed,taxstone was a gangster before he had a podcast hes been shot in the eye been to prison all that
hiphopheads,not_removed,tax has followed the path of charlemagne the god mainly being a bit brash speaking callouslydisrespectfully and being funny but with an intriguing hood aspect on itand its worked out really well for him honestly the only thing is that tax is a conflicted idiot he likes to say yea im not on that gangsta shit no more my life is good yet he continues to flex and try to act hard as if he is still a goon out here i cant tell you how many times ive rolled my eyes at him on his podcast telling people to get at him and insinuating theyre gonna lose their life so basically the guy is an idiot and kinda brings this on himself by acting like he not a civilian when hes clearly in hollywood and living good now whereas charlemagne has never been claiming to be a thug or trying to do thug shit also they had beef in the past dont know about what though troy ave even released a diss to him and tax has continously clowned on his music and antagonized him
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah man in the court of hhh opinions that like second clip is all that matters well that and the fact that he insulted joey badaassss
hiphopheads,not_removed,can someone tldr this comment
hiphopheads,not_removed,well i didnt see that this was a nyt article i thought it was going to be another one of those random awful hip hop new sites with a way drawn out article with little info much better to get some info from comments that might be informed by more sources in that case
hiphopheads,not_removed,glad someone caught that outside of rrapbattles
hiphopheads,not_removed,ls left and right
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol were u there and we feel sorry for people who off themselves why
hiphopheads,not_removed,i understand wanting to wait for more facts but i cant really foresee a situation where troy ave suddenly becomes the victim lol are you serious
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is me only song i remembered from that game when i played it
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes sir goat soundtrack
hiphopheads,not_removed,yup that game was amazing and so was this song
hiphopheads,not_removed,find your man find yours ya mamas here
hiphopheads,not_removed,eminem wrote that song for the movie and he just lent it to mobb deep idk why they didnt credit him but eminem is pissed about it true eminem fan and grade class president
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn really i mean not to sound pretentious but im assuming you are pretty young then when they reminisce over you is literally one of the biggest hip hop songs of all time i dont think anyone can call themselves a hiphop head without knowing of one of the most well known and influential hip hop songs ever made
hiphopheads,not_removed,it is what it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,good find lupe is a fountain of fresh ideas who wouldnt want to steal from him
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah its not serious obviously troy was first when lupe put out that song there was a decent amount of outrage over lazily reusing the beat
hiphopheads,not_removed,your identity has been compromised shoot me your credit card info library card number and shoe size so i can fix for you
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats the joke
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol look at that sub now it is everything i told you it was years ago only now they freely admit it
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,if that was true though imagine being and already having released like classic records mozart level shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,ah the old reddit weezaroo
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,no hes saying like troy will make abunch of tapes referring to his current situations but he cant make new music if hes in jail
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey gucci can say some sick shit when hes beefing like how he has killed before and is ok with killing again but gucci killed intruders with their own gun and here it looks like troy was shot disarmed his assailant and shot back its kinda strange to me but i am certain the hate for troy is purely based on him being a dick about things and tweeting recklessly lesson being that before you kill people try not to step on the toes of your contemporaries fans and making lemonade and other classics in a recent sub genre helps too
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a pretty good song
hiphopheads,not_removed,views grew on me give it another listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,i asked a question but you give me a broad answerok buddy
hiphopheads,not_removed,subjective opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,its hard to hold on to it after you shoot recoil maybe he panicked
hiphopheads,not_removed,i take it youve never fired a gun before those fuckers get real hot if you pop shots right in a row like youve seen on the video add to that the commotion and chaos of everybody knocking you around off balance and the kick from firing the gun and its easy to see how the first shooter could have dropped the gun
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats what i was thinking that the police are going to threaten to put the murder on him unless they can get a case against the person who actually did the shooting i think they know what happened but the cops are only going to push the narrative that makes their case not the truth
hiphopheads,not_removed,or cam making fun of stan spits dead mom
hiphopheads,not_removed,because he didnt actually diss joey he dissed steez who isnt alive to defend himself
hiphopheads,not_removed,hard doesnt equal making fun of suicide hard was when joey roasted him on sway i destroy average rappers its just practice
hiphopheads,not_removed,what he did isnt hard at all it was the weakest and lamest diss track ive ever heard tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats hard about attacking a dead mans name
hiphopheads,not_removed,your friend commits suicide years down the line you have a freestyle battle and your opponent brings it up you think thats a good diss honestly or that its even relevant
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was kinda the joke but youre not wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,its like people here giggled at every troll thing did they giggled at every petty beef petty diss etc then makes fun of a special needs kid and people get worked up theyre rewarding the behavior and then getting upset at the same behavior
hiphopheads,not_removed,you really cant win in this debate rappers do what they rap about those sociopathic idiots they should be in jail why do people enjoy this rappers dont do what they rap about lol this is all about entertainment when is real rap going to come back not saying im for either its just a stupid argument
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean theres a difference between liking violence in entertainment and real life a lot of rap is just entertainment the street stuff is just a reflection of the artists environment some rappers are really dangerous people but most are just entertainers they make their living as poets so even the rappers with the toughest exteriors are probably soft on the inside
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah its nice to see some actual mature responses like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly all you need is one gun and one dumbass and a fight turns to a shooting
hiphopheads,not_removed,tax also shits on him fairly consistently on twitter and also clowns him on other peoples podcasts also tax has been locked up previously so i wouldnt expect a word out of him about the situation
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok guy is nothing but a glorified gossip queen and ethug its painfully obvious that most of his stories are fabricated or he embellishes them past the point of being believable cant believe guys idolize pieces of shit like taxstone
hiphopheads,not_removed,tax still is a gangster you dont lose those connections when you start a podcast
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not all that matters but if you are implying getting shot at gives you a legal defense to start shooting back in an area packed with that many innocent bystanders you are wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know right its like we dont even live in america
hiphopheads,not_removed,tldr why no ppl read
hiphopheads,not_removed,bc mental illness is real and a lot of us arent as fuckin ignorant as yourself
hiphopheads,not_removed,absolutely i might be wrong here im not claiming to be a criminal investigator but if troy went there to start shit and they all got fighting hes at least partially responsible he had no reason to go there besides being mad that taxstone made fun of his record sales unless theres some huge other element at play here that im not aware of lets say one of taxs guys shot troy in the leg and somehow the gun was wrestled away from them troy was potentially innocent right up until he started firing a gun in a crowded place maybe the attempted murder charge is too strong but at the very least its endangerment with a firearm troy isnt without fault no matter which way you slice it im barely even paying attention to this story though so its probably best to leave my opinions to myself i suppose
hiphopheads,not_removed,whaaat what about httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyfblrzcexbk that was my favorite one
hiphopheads,not_removed,edit im an idiot
hiphopheads,not_removed,im from the uk ive been listening to some rap artists for a minute but have only started visiting the older artists since ive joined rhhh a year or two ago for the last few years it seemed my music following was busy with a new release every week so thats why i havent really been giving the essential list a chance
hiphopheads,not_removed,wat
hiphopheads,not_removed,keep fighting the good fight my man lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean he actually did put out platinum records gold records and another almost gold by the time he was it isnt that far off
hiphopheads,not_removed,hold my cough syrup im going in
hiphopheads,not_removed,well most of the hate on this sub started after he dissed joey ton of people here cant take their artist being dissed and constantly hate on the other
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay well dude is a gangster rapper that acted like a gangster in this situation and i respect that hes fake about other things and hated on steez which is bad but in this situation i see no reason to hate
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like the track thanks just makes it even weirder that hed spit all that ny unity shit just to spit on a nyers grave
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh i have i disliked it more on the second listen than i did on the first
hiphopheads,not_removed,if its recoil then either has a ridiculously large gun or really weak grip he probably panicked
hiphopheads,not_removed,i take it you have never shot a gun before theres no modern handgun thats going to heat up even to the point of slight discomfort after one magazine
hiphopheads,not_removed,i doubt it was the heat but i do agree with you that the commotion was probably crazy enough to do something as stupid as dropping your gun
hiphopheads,not_removed,hung out with you on mothers day cause your mothers dead lol cam has zero chill
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly even and game have held back when it comes to the dead
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh ive been getting downvoted to hell everytime i bring up the fact we really dont know what happened and should wait for the all the evidence before we cast judgement lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,same could apply to of rappers troy ave included
hiphopheads,not_removed,id hit the lick with you i just gotta spend min in a room talking to myself da fuck nigga ok mom im coming
hiphopheads,not_removed,the dudes a clown constantly talking about how everyone should leave the streets alone and how theyre all fake tough guys but then constantly hypes himself up as a gangster
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,wuh dis say
hiphopheads,not_removed,ignorant to the idea that people think killing themselves is a solution to living problems lol yeah sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk if its just me but i think lords of the underground was underated
hiphopheads,not_removed,word hey man you arent from the states and you are a teenager still so no worries my dude people can be a lil harsh on here sometimes myself included but dont worry about it honestly who cares about downvotes or people giving you any shit about not knowing the classics yet i came off a bit pretentious thats my b ive been listening to hip hop for over like years so i forget sometimes that not everyone is as exposed to the music ive heard over the years
hiphopheads,not_removed,bad joke pls tell me youre not that gullible
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck meanwhile here i am at dont even got a car lmaooo
hiphopheads,not_removed,not to mention people had already been shitting on him for his sway freestyle and only selling like copies of his album
hiphopheads,not_removed,jada laugh
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah thats what im saying dude named himself after an avenue in new york that was a staple in the drug trafficking into ny and people cal him troy avenue mockingly its all about charisma whether someone loves you or hates you and troy didnt have that going for him
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah hes got the extendo super long perk penetration bullets super magnum desert eagle burst round gold plated joint thats why his shit heats up like that hes got bashs trigun
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i agree with that i got downvoted into oblivion for saying something similar about chief keef awhile back
hiphopheads,not_removed,then troy ave fights with tax troy aves man ends up dead sounds like hes kinda gangster even if hes an idiot
hiphopheads,not_removed,do some research and find out what youre actually talking about man its usually a lot more than i have problem if you arent willing to find out more about mental illness then you should probably not comment on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think there was just soooo much classic shit coming out of ny at the time some people get caught in the crowd
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn youre a dinosaur
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt get the joke in the first place lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,i believe in u dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,lebron signed a million deal at and invalidated billions of lives across the world on the same day in other words dont feel bad as these things happen from time to time
hiphopheads,not_removed,right
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes got bashs trigun laughed way to hard from this
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha damn i guess i just need to step my strap game up
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly though hes a hypocrite as someone eloquently put it a smart dumb nigga
hiphopheads,not_removed,do some research about the chemical reactions that are happening in your brain to make you feel the way you do before you try and throw some freshman psych esque vague comment about how things are bigger than they seem
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea i guess for this sub i am is old around here
hiphopheads,not_removed,¯ツ¯ lets just forget this happened
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank for this encouragement at am when i should be sleep
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit youre fucking pretentious
hiphopheads,not_removed,im just flirting with you im older than that
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah lets

hiphopheads,not_removed,love kirk fire shit right here
hiphopheads,not_removed,this just made my monday
hiphopheads,not_removed,kirk goes hard
hiphopheads,not_removed,kirk knight dope as fuck lks was a great project
hiphopheads,not_removed,not a fan of the sample he uses
hiphopheads,not_removed,because its not drake kanye or kendrick
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats lautrec fam kirk the dude who invades you three times to harvest your humanity for the fair lady
hiphopheads,not_removed,for real no jokes no irony no lies cupcakke fucking brought it on this album and we need to start taking her seriously her technical skills are on point her flow is great and shes getting better every project yes her signature hypersexuality is still around with stuff like cpr and cumshot but on tracks like scraps biggie smalls reality pt shes proving that shes not a one trick pony and the rapping is on point
hiphopheads,not_removed,broooo she legit snaps on some of these im not a huge fan of the electopop rap tracks like cpr and cumshot and biggie smalls but shit like scraps author quick thought and tarzan go hard great production also barcodes is a fuckin tuneeeee
hiphopheads,not_removed,cupcakke invented hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,can damn near eyeball any weight in my sleep
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck yeah wellington rep
hiphopheads,not_removed,my favorties aj tracey santan dave jme skeptas brother wiley others to check out novelist kano dizzie rascal p money giggs tempa t chip yungen cadet head over to rgrime for more suggestions too
hiphopheads,not_removed,first ill start of by saying that konnichiwa and stormzy are pretty poppy for grime skeptas older stuff is more true so check that out if you liked him especially anyway the best minutes in grime history listen to literally anybody here if you like their verses all of them are legends grime is a beefheavy genre battling hasnt really split out of it like it has out of hiphop and this is one of my favorite diss tracks wiley is pretty much the grime rapper he produced a lot of early beats that have become iconic and created the style of the genre peep which you may recognize from a more recent skepta diss another legendary diss from wiley good taste of some new school grime artists kano is another legend and this is probably the best fitb fitb is comparable to sway in the morning and a lot of rappers have dropped their best verse on it as for albums there are really only two absolute classics dizzee rascal boy in da corner wiley treddin on thin ice otherwise you can just listen to albums by whoever you find and like its still a pretty underground genre and so its not the easiest to maneuver your way through
hiphopheads,not_removed,giggs i think drake cosign
hiphopheads,not_removed,some of skeptas older stuff is dope i recommend blacklisted in particular apart from the ones already mentioned some good lesser known guys are rocks foe merky ace ygg berna one mc that you def should check out is avelino another young guy top up and comers id say wretch has kind of taken him under his wing and is teaching him the game theres ocean wisdom hes more hiphop tbf lyrics are sometimes ehhhh but his flow and delivery are on point things to check out new gen collab album avelino long time coming single wretch growing over life aj tracey lil tracey santan dave six paths avelino fyo
hiphopheads,not_removed,skepta is really good upcoming rapper from british land
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks

hiphopheads,not_removed,thats a good sign i loved hallways havent had chance to listen yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,this beat is so simple but so hard
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have to see this man perform before i die

hiphopheads,not_removed,ur hella late someone posted this like an hour ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,i came in here expecting complete bullshit but this made a depressing amount of sense also it shows young thug with bloody bandages around his eyes this shows that he has officially taken lil waynes spot by becoming as famous as he was at the time or its an allusion to when oedipus blinded himself or whatever idk how what you said makes sense

hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely check out his mixtape heart of the projects
hiphopheads,not_removed,ummm mixtapes do you not listen to any southern or trap music at all

hiphopheads,not_removed,dude is a beast
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil booby
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely the track that got me hooked to frank when he started blowing up in honest lyrics cool beat and that classic frank ocean timbre in his voice
hiphopheads,not_removed,i guess november it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,kill me now
hiphopheads,not_removed,fitting consider its the end of july
hiphopheads,not_removed,im so sorry for and disappointed in myself why do i keep building up my emotions knowing theyll be torn to shreds thank you again for the rollercoaster frankie lets do this again never
hiphopheads,not_removed,same as last year
hiphopheads,not_removed,tears in my eyes for that nonexistent new album
hiphopheads,not_removed,nostalgia ultra is so good honestly more people need to listen to it so many of those idiots on twitter spouting where is le album frank xd probably havent even listened to it before
hiphopheads,not_removed,chance said wake up early i know us frank fans have dikembe reach game atm but we cant lose hope
hiphopheads,not_removed,some insider on ktt is saying the new album is coming out august but god damn i dont want to believe that i need this album now fam im in a transitional period in my life and only frank can lead me down the right path been bumping channel orange everyday for the past two weeks in preparation for this new album and my girlfriend is getting damn tired of my bullshit i dont care i need you frankie drop that heat on us
hiphopheads,not_removed,july aint over i still got hope
hiphopheads,not_removed,future tense im crying right now bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,if the album doesnt drop yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont wanna ruin it but november is also a sunday an unlikely day for a release date
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think nostalgia is amazing it got me into frank but channel orange solidified him as one of my favorite artists ever
hiphopheads,not_removed,original and funny joke
hiphopheads,not_removed,frank ocean can drop whenever he wants he can send the album to apple and they will release it or whatever streaming platform he wants to he can release it on his website at any fucking time there is no law or rule prohibiting artists from dropping outside of fridays some of u fuckers are retarted if he wants to drop it tomorrow or any other day of the year he will
hiphopheads,not_removed,at least theres no boys do cry joke in the thread
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuckers on reddit telling me always in every thread frank ocean aint gon drop this frank ocean aint gon drop that shut the fuck up
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay
hiphopheads,not_removed,boyyyyyyyyyyy calm down its just common knowledge at this point that labels push artists to release albums on fridays as it allows for the longest first week numbers of course im hoping frank drops tomorrow but at this point i trust no one not even frank
hiphopheads,not_removed,😘
hiphopheads,not_removed,man its just fucking annoying as fuck to see all these fuckers its a sunday it cant drop like fuck off shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think it is but its not some universal impossibility
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh so like be humble is kendrick trying to tell himself to chill and not act like hes all that
hiphopheads,not_removed,woops forget to mention that too that is definitely possible i thought that he was acting like a lot of famous rappers these days its heavily satirized but a lot of rappers rap about themselves being almost like god and being very braggadocios in their songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,xanax version of turk jd lol peep and tracy have incredible chemistry
hiphopheads,not_removed,only place not sold out is brisbane which is useless for someone like me in sydney
hiphopheads,not_removed,why is he playing at such a small venue its a joke
hiphopheads,not_removed,need to be quicker
hiphopheads,not_removed,oi mate is a fokin joke how these skippas try oun take all ow tickets get the roos on em eh dingo
hiphopheads,not_removed,another pro era project cant wait for that and hopefully the secret project is king capital or maybe at least there will be some new steez verses on the pro era project
hiphopheads,not_removed,camron and tpain are signed to cinematic why did i not know this
hiphopheads,not_removed,i had noooooooooo clue tpain was signed to this label
hiphopheads,not_removed,edit said quavo in the title meant migos lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,i fuckin hope so i need new tyler music that sounds like
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit homie maybe
hiphopheads,not_removed,well hes dropped and so far so id say its likely
hiphopheads,not_removed,your reply for some reason had me non stop laughing as if you just realised or somethin but yeah could be will be years since cherry bomb soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,i gotta be honest ive never really been a big fan of sleaford mods i dont know why they just never really did it for me but i think this track really kinda made it click for me its pretty dope thanks op 👍
hiphopheads,not_removed,it always sounds like hes just walked in to your apartment somewhere and started venting his day to you but after a couple listens you start to hear his rhyme schemes which are really weird the different characters and story telling and then it becomes very interesting i would only listen to these guys in the car or somewhere i wont be too distracted never play them as background music because the magic is lost if you cant pay too close attention
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like your khaled got bigger since a week ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,anybody got a production list on one track i hear a drop that dj smokey usually uses
hiphopheads,not_removed,but will this be on spotify
hiphopheads,not_removed,i demand logic flair
hiphopheads,not_removed,rattpack represent
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow i wonder what hhh is going to think of the race verse s
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you i love this
hiphopheads,not_removed,is it just me or is this song super sharp on the ears im having trouble listening to it but it may just because i listened to alotttt of music today hopefully it wont be like that in the morning
hiphopheads,not_removed,same old logic production im digging the lyrics and themes though hoping to see that thematic focus on this album
hiphopheads,not_removed,great value kendrick
hiphopheads,not_removed,its on google play music dont know why spotify doesnt have it yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,does logic have anything that could be used as a flair i cant think of any logo he uses besides his name on a nasa logo or maybe like a rubiks cube
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah if logic got a flair hed just be biting all the other rappers with flairs smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,i swear everyone that says that rattpack thing almost only listens to logic and fight anyone that doesnt like him judging by your post history id say im pretty damn close too lol barely any posts on this sub until today and described kendricks new song to be eh
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know i thought this was a much different sounding beat than he usually makes
hiphopheads,not_removed,this beat is pretty underwhelming compared to his other shit he has some dope production like bars
hiphopheads,not_removed,we have a ton of flairs for him over at
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes my favorite rapper and hes the reason that i got into hiphop in the first place i listen to other rappers like jonwayne gibbs kendrick j cole after a few more listens kendricks new song has gotten better but i just felt it was missing something for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe its just a combination of elements ive heard in several other songs dont get me wrong though i like the track
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,this sounds like some yachty bubblegum rap shit not a fan at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,its diff
hiphopheads,not_removed,it indeed is weird wonder why he posted it twice cant pick out whats different at all though listened to the original like i personally like it though lol not for skepta but i like the track itself was hoping he mixed his vocals correctly in this version
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh no just when i thought you were gone forever
hiphopheads,not_removed,what program do you use
hiphopheads,not_removed,track of a friend let me know what you think

hiphopheads,not_removed,hey every hip hop artist ever remember ireland me neither
hiphopheads,not_removed,i went to a couple of his shows one before trilogy dropped in canada and the second after kiss land in the us first show was fucking dope in a booming and intimate venue but was disappointed in his show stateside couldve been because it was at a huge festival or his sound crew was just shit cos the bass overpowered anything coming from his mic good dude tho signed my exs hoodie but lets be real it was really my hoodie
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was supposed to see him in queens at the meadows fest and he bailed for snl left a salty taste in my mouth that being said depending on who his guest is i might have to drive down to dallas
hiphopheads,not_removed,any indication to when tickets are out
hiphopheads,not_removed,anyone have any idea when the tickets go on sale

hiphopheads,not_removed,no ireland show 😞🇮🇪
hiphopheads,not_removed,aint nobody ever come to oklahoma
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was really lucky to buy a ticket for his toronto show on friday may couldnt get two together but i managed to get one great lower bowl seat in the presale on thursday pricey but if his shows are as great as people say it is then i shouldnt regret it i just wish i was able to save more but tickets in the upper bowl are quite costly and i was unable to get some of the cheaper ones at least i can resell the ticket directly on ticketmaster in ontario canada it is legal to resell tickets as long you provided authenticity or offer a moneyback guarantee if the tickets are fake i did resell tickets on ticketmaster in the past but for now it looks like i will go

hiphopheads,not_removed,finally coming to sweden shame his fanbase has gotten cancerous but been listening to the dude since hob so i gotta go couldve chosen someone more exciting than uzi vert
hiphopheads,not_removed,you know it always sucks when american or european artists skip the middle of canada on their tours but it really sucks when canadian artists do it
hiphopheads,not_removed,weird he isnt coming to boston but ill be at the ct date for sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre the man for this i got shafted for last years tour so im hoping i can go this time around

hiphopheads,not_removed,hype definitely going to the stockholm one
hiphopheads,not_removed,im upset hes not hitting up edmonton but he did come here last year i just didnt go fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,man sj over oakland or sf
hiphopheads,not_removed,its one of my favorite live performances hes pretty damn amazing granted it was his kiss land tour
hiphopheads,not_removed,show itself was pretty lit but the tracklist for bbtm tour didnt do much for me all the hits from trilogy though like absolutely no kissland otherwise crowd was into to and he killed it showmanshipwise
hiphopheads,not_removed,really fucking amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,how was the schoolboy concert im seeing him in december
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw him last november at msg and it was one of the best shows i have seen he has very a unique voice and i was scared that he wouldnt sound good live but i was pleasantly surprised his voice was great in person and he really did put on a great show
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw him for the kissland tour and kotf personally i think more dearly of the kissland show bc it was a more intimate venue but kotf had a whole different type of energy he can definitely carry the big stage
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive been to every major concert this year except for rihanna which i still regret ugh and his was the best that voice great stage presence fucking flamethrowers and visuals top notch
hiphopheads,not_removed,saw the king of the fall tour with jhene schoolboy and the weeknd schoolboy was really good but the weeknd was unreal lit
hiphopheads,not_removed,eh he wasnt very enjoyable i found at least that hes not a very good performer at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,dudes already got dates lined up for the first half of if this is phase one i imagine hes gonna be touring all of when you include phase abel making fuckin bank
hiphopheads,not_removed,source
hiphopheads,not_removed,how do you write aleef asking for a friend xx
hiphopheads,not_removed,does brad pitt have many movies involving fly fishing in montana
hiphopheads,not_removed,what yall got out there besides vegas
hiphopheads,not_removed,its worse here in mn no one ever comes here
hiphopheads,not_removed,still not as bad as oklahoma i always gotta go to dallas for shows
hiphopheads,not_removed,aye we got drake schoolboy and kanye in the last two months alone
hiphopheads,not_removed,as a fort wayne resident ive gotten used to it its just frustrating that we cant ever get any indy shows only hip hop artist to come here in recent memory is when kanye opened the saint pablo tour at bankers life had to go to columbus for drake going to detroit for kanye now its between chicago and detroit for the weeknd
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant wait for people on the sub to be dissapointed by it id love if he did roo
hiphopheads,not_removed,i couldnt believe it saved us for last
hiphopheads,not_removed,festival sound is always shitty unless its the headliner and even then its still a bit shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,its always our hoodies
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah fuck this nigga after that debacle i was mad salty
hiphopheads,not_removed,presale tomorrow
hiphopheads,not_removed,sale for sweden tix starts november
hiphopheads,not_removed,presale is tomorrow
hiphopheads,not_removed,or the parts of canada that arent vancouver or the toronto area
hiphopheads,not_removed,i fucking know right i want him to come here so bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah there is it starts tomorrow at am you just go on the regular ticketmaster page for the concert and at am youll be able to enter the first digits of your citi card to unlock the presale then just buy the tickets
hiphopheads,not_removed,how so because hes mainstream
hiphopheads,not_removed,money over everythang
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake weeknd drake even cancelled his sas mb stops a couple of tours ago they sell out too i dont get it
hiphopheads,not_removed,or philly
hiphopheads,not_removed,remember last time at worcester when he was all like i know i skipped you guys during the last tour but ill never pass on yall again
hiphopheads,not_removed,no problem man i did it for another post recently so i said fuck it why not do it again i saw him last year in december and it was a pretty dope show i got laid before and after the show as cliche as this sounds the vibes for that day were amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you want to you can edit in the special guests its bryson tiller and lil uzi vert its on the site of the belgian tourstop its in dutch though in het kader van zijn nieuwe plaat kondigt the weeknd de starboy legend of the fall world tour aan speciaal voor de gelegenheid brengt hij special guests bryson tiller en lil uzi vert mee op vrijdag maart is het sportpaleis aan de beurt
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw some shows have that would rather wait for an official announcement tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah it appears theyve been listed for some shows but no official announcement as of yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,whoooooahh a hijacking sounds wiiiiiiild
hiphopheads,not_removed,los angeles and brooklyn also have two backtoback dates
hiphopheads,not_removed,no kissland yeah thats a shame i will be at his show in germany for a first time and i would love to hear belong to the world or adaptation live but unfortunately he wants to forget this chapter
hiphopheads,not_removed,how much were the tickets
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit me too it looks so good judging by his snapchat
hiphopheads,not_removed,its definitely a great show i dont think you will be upset one bit i went to the toronto show and this was his set list a mix of songs but a great performance overall he thanked the audience twice one after blessed and then again after the show and each one seemed really heartfelt and sincere not sure how yours will go but if its anything like my experience you will have an amazing time
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw him in san antonio and the show was really awesome he played a great mix of blankface and oxymoron
hiphopheads,not_removed,saw him when he was out of shape and it was brutal but he has taken his fitness and health a bit more serious in the past year since that concert and his shows look better
hiphopheads,not_removed,saw him at a festival middle of the day and obviously not everyone knows all the songs but he was really good was expecting him to start flagging halfway through cos hes chubby and probably high but he kept the energy up the whole way through
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw schoolboy open for the weeknd actually years ago id rate him about average in terms of rap performances if you are a fan youll have a good time but it is nothing life changing or must go or anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,schoolboy was really good he played many songs from every album stayed longer than expected did encores closing with that part and hell of a night having joey open was crazy because that was a good performance itself by the time joey finished i felt like i got my money worth but then slowly realized that schoolboy is still coming out and it was just too much great show plan on going every year and he already confirmed that hes touring again in or at least being a special guest for someone elses your praying for a tde show
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw him a couple weeks ago in vancouver shit was fucking lit if you have joey opening its gonna be even better i came into the concert without any knowledge of joey badass and now i think hes an amazing artist schoolboy q keeps so much energy throughout the entire show
hiphopheads,not_removed,whend you see him with a seated floor that wasnt the case at the show i went to
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think that phase means dates phase will be tickets and guests
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,where was it confirmed
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpwwwmojonlconcertentheweeknd
hiphopheads,not_removed,just those two i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,atliens
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol reno which is also a fairly sizable city too
hiphopheads,not_removed,this aint true the twin cities are just big enough to get a lot of artists coming through but also not so big that most tickets sell out like instantly helps that we have a pretty healthy music scene here
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah seriously this sucks at least we got kanye and drake but its rough missing roy woods the weeknd and more young thug did just announce a nov date for mn i really hope we get travis tiller and kendrick to come thru here
hiphopheads,not_removed,fr fam no one wants to come to oklahoma not all of us are bad i swear
hiphopheads,not_removed,im going to chicago
hiphopheads,not_removed,im pretty down for it too he fits the category of probably wouldnt drop the cash to go see a solo show but looking forward to checking out the set of festival headliner for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck you dick ridin ass niggas too
hiphopheads,not_removed,presale
hiphopheads,not_removed,well it comes natural to every rnb artist to have a religious fanbase once they blow up no hate to the dude though and i actually liked bbtm a lot
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit didnt know he cancelled those that really sucks i didnt make it to his edmonton show this time around but he sold out both nights almost immediately im sure weeknd would too
hiphopheads,not_removed,im stoked hes coming to ac artists rarely come to ac anymore especially since so many casinos and venues have shut down its literally mins from me
hiphopheads,not_removed,how tf is he doing a world tour but not coming to philadelphia
hiphopheads,not_removed,that mustve been one of the best days of your life
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like to live on the edge
hiphopheads,not_removed,my bad i need coffee
hiphopheads,not_removed,why does he want to forget that chapter kissland was pretty good
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats a dope set list tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,anything from habits of even setbacks
hiphopheads,not_removed,bbtm tour in houston was seated floor everybody was standing though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt think of it that way honestly
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,what yall got out there in reno
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait thugger is coming here on the omg it is getting better scott would be nice and i think hell make his way here was able to go to both drake and kanye but there are some times where we can go an entire year without a big name
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah if you order a special edition of the album through his website it comes with a presale code for tomorrow
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah im actually considering moving out there even though i really do love edmonton and its a lot cheaper here aha we normally get bigger artists like this though especially here in yeg with our new arena do have ace hood to look forward to tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,man im in central nj and idk if i should go to the newark show or ac show theyre both like an hour away from me
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was a cool way to end especially since those last few months i was going through some shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah if his setlist at voodoo fest this past weekend is any indication of the show will be from starboy and bbtm
hiphopheads,not_removed,well i dont have a source but im pretty sure that he considers kl a flop so thats why he wants to forget it he always perfora songs from trilogy but almost never from kl
hiphopheads,not_removed,easily the weakest of his albums and probably the least liked by his fans
hiphopheads,not_removed,ya it was pretty good especially the last few songs i had hopes he would do ride out at some point but i cant complain too much as it was a pretty good set
hiphopheads,not_removed,he played blessed and hands on the wheel
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hate you
hiphopheads,not_removed,you got me lmao edit forreal tho we got casinos n shit but mainly people come out here cuz its close to lake tahoe and its a great place to swim in the summer and snowboard in the winter what sucks is that artists will come to nevada but only vegas which is a nine hour drive south from reno people here can only count on artists coming thru sacramento which is hours away just wish i lived in a city where artists come thru for sure like la or atlanta
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah thug got announced last night
hiphopheads,not_removed,can i use it for the oslo concert as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,with the new rogers stadium place i always forget the noun at the end you guys got in edmonton you should be able to have more concert with time i guess its hard to get a feel for the stadium as its brand new at least with rogers arena in vancouver and acc in toronto the arenas have been there long enough for concert planners to get a feel for it
hiphopheads,not_removed,id go ac but im biased if you rent a room early enough before the show its cheap then you can go there hit the casinos do tropicana or caesars and drink for free on the floor gamble if you want or hit the club make a two day trip out of it
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely mustve been good after going through stuff as well what was your favorite song that he sang that night
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably least popular but no way its weakest its solid all the way through if youre into that particular sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,hell no kiss land is a hell of a lot better than bbtm
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah definitely but it wasnt terrible
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit not there he go
hiphopheads,not_removed,blessed fo real nice now im hyped af his both verses or just a cut
hiphopheads,not_removed,gracias papi
hiphopheads,not_removed,blown up
hiphopheads,not_removed,you got a link to it i cant find it
hiphopheads,not_removed,not sure i think its usa and canada only
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol id love to but im and a broke college student id probably go to the show and go home
hiphopheads,not_removed,he did a ton of songs so i cant really pick one but one of the most memorable moments was this transition of him going from king of the fall to to crew love
hiphopheads,not_removed,solid but still weakest imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,my bad yeah he played there he go if you look at comment with the tracklist it was almost identical if not the same
hiphopheads,not_removed,he played both verses and kendricks was cut
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks now im really looking forward to his show and hands on the wheel is gonna be dope too
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a solid interview a little brief tbh though on trump its a bit of a challenge cause we dont know who he is all the time hes been consistent about being a racist and about a couple of other things but hes also been wildly inconsistent and lied a lot so we truly dont know how hes gonna govern we havent seen anyone like him before its a very kind of different world now knowing that someones going to possibly dismantle a lot of what obama accomplished i dont know where were going to go on kanye this is a very difficult life and a difficult business i dont want to try to play pop psychologist so im not gonna try to analyze whats happening with him i just want him to do whatever he needs to do to feel better and to feel like hes ready to go again because music needs him the world needs him i think hes such an important talent we need him at full strength how do you balance everything you do – acting producing music fatherhood about how artists should react to trump paul robeson said that artists are the gatekeepers of truth and nina simone said were supposed to reflect the times so we have to be ready to tell the truth and reflect whats going on weve gone through some really dark periods in this country you cant trivialize them because they cost people their lives but we have made progress since those times and even when we go backward theres definitely an opportunity for us to go forward again we just have to be vigilant and get through this and then hopefully itll be over soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,duh kanye west is literally a god
hiphopheads,not_removed,bollcks sell outs
hiphopheads,not_removed,alright guys seriously how the fuck does this relate to hip hop at all john legend is not hip hop he barely mentions kanye west and he calls the president a racist i come here to see news info and discussion related to hip hop not the bullshit political musings of another millionaire celeb who is not even a rapper or producer btw trying to tell me how to think this sub has gone way down hill tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,he said trump is consistently a racist not true he said hes going to dismantle a lot of what obama accomplished he didnt accomplish anything except lead us to the point where half the country felt like they needed trump to fix everything thats real bad i dont like trump but the more people just blatantly spout off lies about him the worse this whole thing is gonna be
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck john legends stupid boring vanilla bullshit the man is the half chub of the music world
hiphopheads,not_removed,totally agree with him about trump i have no idea what to fully expect and its scary
hiphopheads,not_removed,christian moms about to have a seizure
hiphopheads,not_removed,just go to one of the other topics on this sub
hiphopheads,not_removed,looking thru your comment history you seem much more keen to discuss politics and john legends involvement in hip hop more than anyone else here maybe the problem youre complaining about wouldnt be here if you werent vehemently discussing it more than anyone else cares to in fact that seems to be the entirety of your postings to hhh tell me again about how you were here when this sub was better
hiphopheads,not_removed,most of the people john legend has collaborated with are hiphop acts he has enough songs with rappers for him to have a viable viewpoint in hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,hip hop no politics pick one
hiphopheads,not_removed,you can easily hide posts dingus
hiphopheads,not_removed,john legend was signed to good music for a while and has worked with kanye a lot its hiphop related
hiphopheads,not_removed,obama halved the deficit pushed lgbt rights created an average of jobs a day insured millions of previously uninsured americans and eliminated osama all while having to compromise with obstructionist republicans whos only goal was to stop obama from doing anything these are the same people who literally shut down the government because of their refusal to compromise but yes tell us more about how a man who kicked blacks out of his casinos whenever rich whites were there isnt a racist
hiphopheads,not_removed,the altright nazis feel represented by his administration and his businesses have been repeatedly accused of discrimination not to mention trumps entire cabinet is old white men and ben carson if you dont see some pattern of racism there then you need to look a little bit harder
hiphopheads,not_removed,he has literally gone to court over not renting to black people thats racism
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like how even a neutral opinion of trump is met with downvotes
hiphopheads,not_removed,agreed
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly
hiphopheads,not_removed,years
hiphopheads,not_removed,people keep saying this but you dont have to look at trump look at his party and what theyve done for the working class over the decades thats not gonna change just cause some clown is president
hiphopheads,not_removed,considering who he has chosen for his transition team you can pretty much tell hes there to fuck shit up
hiphopheads,not_removed,ik but this shit mad off topic idk how it keeps poppin up
hiphopheads,not_removed,i liked to lurk bro is that a sin ive been subbed since i joined reddit like years ago is it really unrealistic to say john legend and his retarded political views are irrelevant to hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,aight guys aviccii is hip hop cuz they did some collabs pack it in
hiphopheads,not_removed,john legend hip hop pick one
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah which i will do but still tho i dont go to rhhh to see rpolitics just like i dont go to rgw to see some foliage
hiphopheads,not_removed,til being singed to a rapper means youre a rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,the national debt literally doubled those job creation numbers are and have always been bullshit regardless of who has been in office theyre manipulated to fit whatever narrative they want to spew out he forced that horrendous obamacare system on everyone he armed countries that desire a nuclear war with nuclear weapons negotiated and made deals with terrorists handled the ferguson situation worse than i thought was possible and signed more executive orders than any president in history please tell us more about how great he was and i love how no matter what if you hire a white guy for a job youre racist and even when you hire a black guy for a job youre still racist thats just what america needs more labeling and name calling like a bunch of graders to unite the country fantastic
hiphopheads,not_removed,its unrealistic that youve browsed hhh for years and seemed to only ever comment in near identical threads about john legend criticizing trump yes what is also interesting is that you dont have any comments complaining about the countless rnb singersnonrappers who get discussed here daily nor do you have any comments in the other antitrump threads that have been posted on this sub finally if you think politics are irrelevant to hip hop then you have no fucking idea what hip hop is about all of this together makes me think youre probably just searching for any threads that have to do with trump or tim duncan apparently and talking shit about dissenters
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao bro r u obsessed with me or what im sorry i dont go on reddit enough for you or comment on enough things you can check bro ive had an account for like years now and the reason i got an account was to sub to hhh next it would be unrealistic for me to call out every post thats off topic im not the damn topic police i just comment when i feel like its deserved further i btfod that nutlicker who said td was better than bird lol that shit was hilarious tho so im glad you found that shit because like come on duncan over bird was that kid for real bird literally shat on duncan in every statistical category known to man lmao but yeah dude i just like rap i like real rappers like ye and jay and and mos and kweli i like to hear a dope flow and meaningful lyrics i dont like rpolitics circle jerks yes i realize hip hop like most music is political but no i dont care what these people think because most of them dont have more than a high school education and arent qualified to sway my opinion on contentious issues the reason i take offense to this post in particular is because john legend isnt hip hop black hip hop sorry he doesnt nor has he ever spit a verse or rapped in any form hes a rnb singer with a gospel twinge great stuff but not rap so why does he keep popping up on my damn feed and yes i do like to debate politics online because i dont like people i know getting mad as so often happens in such debates irl but since i love to debate politics i do it online is that so abhorrent to you idk what your problem is man idk whyyoure mad about my comment history but is inarguable that this soft ass reporting about a bout a borderline rnbgospel singer is not about rap so why the fuck is it in myrap forum
hiphopheads,not_removed,it took me all of seconds to find the info i got im still confused as to how you dont complain about the dozens of other rnb artistsnonmusicians discussed here and how you seem to think rapping is the only thing that defines hip hop far from it it is a whole culture you also seem like a very sad person based on this last comment im replying to
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao bro whered you get your degree in deductive psychology the sherlock holmes institute of people who fancy themselves as being smarter than the general populace and because usually i just ignore it but this is an egregious attempt by a lonely man to harvest internet points through the exploitation of the hurr durr trump racist circle jerk its just mildly annoying but if you would like ill go through every post ever posted here and comment if its irrelevant also by definition hip hop has rapping try a dictionary in addition the culture that immediately surrounds could be called hip hop culture but the peripheral culture involving shit like bball rnb donks etc is best described as urban you seem like a very dimwitted sad lonely man based on your last comment i hope everythings ok i got my phd from the sherlock holmes institute of deductive psych and wrote my thesis on the analysis of reddit comments to determine the mind states of individuals down to their favoritecolors
hiphopheads,not_removed,im sorry you feel hurt inside i hope your mind finds peace and will no longer get triggered by internet comments
hiphopheads,not_removed,im sorry that youre blind i hope the lord comes thru for you and heals that ish
hiphopheads,not_removed,i enjoyed reading this argument thank you
hiphopheads,not_removed,ya i cant say i expected it to get that deep he really was into that tim duncan thing lmao

hiphopheads,not_removed,this was on rockys snapchat this morning also there are rumors her and rocky are dating but all that is from an anonymous source close to kendall
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats chances snap
hiphopheads,not_removed,comedians eh who woulda thought
hiphopheads,not_removed,man if i was and a millionaire id probably be dead already from all the stupid shit id have done good on tyler for not being dead
hiphopheads,not_removed,and like every year old out in public that acts out and lets say yells something immature and obnoxious like booooobies and all of his year old friends think hes fuckin hilarious and the rest of the world is like grow the fuck up you fuckin dork we all went through that stage for some period and we all grew out of it fairly quickly too
hiphopheads,not_removed,its charming sometimes but other times its like holy shit this isnt even comedy anymore when he makes his voice all husky and starts screaming it reminds me of being in school when youre like and one of your friends wants attention no wonder they kicked him out early hed be tiring to deal with sober but fuck dealing with that high
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty sure he mentioned it on one of his songs i have adhd i should win a fuckin award for being me
hiphopheads,not_removed,i appreciate someone who knows their
hiphopheads,not_removed,its the crazy off da budsack version thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,true but i also see tyler around the neighborhood occasionally
hiphopheads,not_removed,the one i work at is way shittier yall found some niceass targets lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea weho target looked like they were driving through west hollywood on teh way there too
hiphopheads,not_removed,never noticed until now but it looks like post malone made a cameo at the end of that thats dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,whoosh
hiphopheads,not_removed,peppa pig laugh
hiphopheads,not_removed,thread over
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,omg this comment killed me last night and i came back to visit it again and it killed me again
hiphopheads,not_removed,bravo
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,kendalls always rumored to be dating someone i wouldnt believe it until its official
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats rockys snapchat
hiphopheads,not_removed,im pretty sure her manager confirmed it
hiphopheads,not_removed,mynamechance
hiphopheads,not_removed,im sure hes cut it close especially if he actually drives as sketchy as he does
hiphopheads,not_removed,it helps that he doesnt drink and do drugs at least he says that
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty sure he just left kicking him out was a joke
hiphopheads,not_removed,tyler doesnt smoke he was sober
hiphopheads,not_removed,odd toddlers i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats asap lou banga
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not post malone
hiphopheads,not_removed,doesnt look anything like him lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit youre right for anyone lookin
hiphopheads,not_removed,nothing went over my head it was just a bad joke hoe
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,naaaw bronson asked him ya done wit sandwich then he got the hint and figured they couldnt take all his ridiculous antics
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes talking about the others being high and dealing with him
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah i have adhd too and im sure he has it
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh my fault
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh word that wouldnt be something id want to deal with
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn typos
hiphopheads,not_removed,poppystreet
hiphopheads,not_removed,why dont you love us frank
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is surprising because he hasnt had a solo production credit on a track since op i believe weird because he came into the game as a producer also random fact he put nav on birds because he liked that he is a rapperproducer like himself
hiphopheads,not_removed,deet deet hours
hiphopheads,not_removed,im thinking hell probably go for an approach where he oversees and helps out with production from his usual collaborators and other producers just like kanye did on tlop i doubt well see many beat where trav is the only producer this upcoming year
hiphopheads,not_removed,well that sucks considering hes a terrible producer
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think he actually will make the beats because he usually does oversee the production of the projects if you watch vids such as the making of skyfall
hiphopheads,not_removed,he came into the game as a producer
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know he oversees it a lot of the time i meant that this time he will be slightly more involved with whoever he is working with to the point where he actually gets a production credit
hiphopheads,not_removed,and he sucked
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh i see
hiphopheads,not_removed,whys that he helped a lot with the production of yeezus and cruel summer if you dont like those thats fine too but his peersmentors def saw something in him
hiphopheads,not_removed,the thing is he doesnt produce material like yeezus or cruel summer hes not using his strengths but if he does more stuff like yeezus i think he can be good
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah the intro is different for sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,whoooo boy this post is stupid
hiphopheads,not_removed,they sample the same song
hiphopheads,not_removed,would have loved to see tut on zays next project i know it might be an unpopular opinion here but i fuck w tut more than isiah
hiphopheads,not_removed,no required this is smooth
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont sleep on this
hiphopheads,not_removed,im slightly more excited for tuts ep than zaywops project tbh preachers son cilvia demo kay is a god tuts verses resonate more too
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey man i mean you like what you like lol but tut is crazy so i get your opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont get me wrong i love zay but i just think tut is a little better in just every way hes slightly more lyrical has really strong melodys and hooks and that ktoven production tho i think preachers son really benefitted from having a very tight production list kept it cohesive but very interesting at the same time really reminds me of outkast in some ways
hiphopheads,not_removed,i completely agree and i also like how tut has made it his thing to help out chattanooga while rashad seems like he left the city to chase his dreams with tde the two came up together in chattanooga but shh thats our little secret cuz the rest of hhh will get triggered and get a stroke if they ever saw our comments
hiphopheads,not_removed,im just glad yg and mustard are back together
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn apple music exclusive his last album was a google play exclusive wish it was just released wide ill check it out for sure though been really looking forward to this

hiphopheads,not_removed,rmakinghiphop
hiphopheads,not_removed,do you post this on every instrumental shared on this sub lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,naw saw from your comment history that youve never visited the sub and thought youd appreciate it
hiphopheads,not_removed,no worries man i probably got the wrong idea but that clears it up i actually have been on the sub quite a bit but its with a different account of mine even have a cypherwinning flair with that one haha dope sub for sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,one of the best album openers ever loved this whole album
hiphopheads,not_removed,akademiks and shkreli are surprisingly friendly towards each other now
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea it started off pretty heavy but smoothed out good convo
hiphopheads,not_removed,anybody who takes the time to talk it out with grandmaster shkreli usually ends up liking him or at least realize he got shat on in the media undeservedly really good pr move to jus sit around and do livestreams instead of letting the media run the narrative
hiphopheads,not_removed,i see what youre saying but conversely making videos with threats of sending goons after someone cant reflect well on his future business dealings
hiphopheads,not_removed,i sorta thought kehlani was just the newest low talent radio voice for a while but i saw an interview she did where she explains her influences and how she got recognized and i like her stuff a lot more now shes really down to earth and aware of her spot in the industry radio singles this song with post could be really good or super corny
hiphopheads,not_removed,this beat sounds like a southside knockoff and your voice sounds so uninspired try switching it up next time
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmfaoooo
hiphopheads,not_removed,not me on the beat though just posting what i find
hiphopheads,not_removed,well the beat sounds like a southside knockoff lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,facts
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea well see muthafucka
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not even right on the periscope that snippets from mike dean desiigner said there was a collab between them and travis on the way but they never said timmy turner was that collab
hiphopheads,not_removed,complex makin shit up who woulda thought
hiphopheads,not_removed,travis didnt even say that
hiphopheads,not_removed,when i read the title of this post i figured that this was the title of the project because you capitalized every word
hiphopheads,not_removed,why is every word capitalized
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey dude ive been editing for a minute and just wanted to say you could do well to limit your adjective use and let the subjects objects and actions speak for themselves just my two cents — have a good one
hiphopheads,not_removed,well worth the read i found that i could relate with some characters with their drug use most of my friends take psychedelics to learn something about themselves rather than to trip balls looking forward to follow ups from this
hiphopheads,not_removed,tbh thatd be hilarious
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have no idea why it ended up formatted that way i realize how much of an eye sore it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks and as an year old im still working on refining my style however within a year im confident it will become more balanced
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks a lot i appreciate it ill have a follow up in the troubled boys series coming within the next week or so and it also focuses on shifting the narrative of psychedelics from the duuuude i see floating cats stigma to the reality which is duuuude i understand why i act this way and im going to change
hiphopheads,not_removed,good stuff i wouldnt have thought you were
hiphopheads,not_removed,tossed bullets for bucks like i was jameis winston favourite line of the year
hiphopheads,not_removed,fake
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think having the features and cocreators of the album hidden throught out the artwork of the album like some wherewaldo type shit is a pretty fun and creative way of announcing these things and building hype
hiphopheads,not_removed,there is a slight chance cole could be featured on logic and kendricks album along with joeys which we already know that possibility is pretty awesome
hiphopheads,not_removed,cole on logics and joeys albums im happy
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit khalid is there
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo thats dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,its on both deluxe and normal cover
hiphopheads,not_removed,now all he gotta do is draw freddie gibbs in the pic
hiphopheads,not_removed,on the deluxe version is everybody documentary a song or an actual documentary
hiphopheads,not_removed,so all these people on here are rumored to be featured id love to see how gambino would contribute to this
hiphopheads,not_removed,is it possible he is predicting going platinum with no features
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit lmao do you guys see juicy j in the bottom middle
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is the album picture quality right its not just my screen trying to load cuz i cant see shit edit oh ok its just the corner of the whole cover thats why its pixelated af
hiphopheads,not_removed,if that really is cole hes also in the same pose as on the cover of forest hills driv
hiphopheads,not_removed,we are reaching new levels of corny edit slay me for disrespecting queen logic
hiphopheads,not_removed,and people think this shit was done in weeks lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,the funniest part is that waldo from wheres waldo is literally on the cover
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you look closely on the bottom youll see juicy j as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,cole is rumored to be on kendricks
hiphopheads,not_removed,forgot cole was on joeys album now im happy too
hiphopheads,not_removed,although highly unlikely i am hoping for a cole feature on kendricks album
hiphopheads,not_removed,so is juicy j
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats what im sayinnn what a time to be alive
hiphopheads,not_removed,killer mike throwing the rtj in the middle left as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,not on the normal one
hiphopheads,not_removed,all the way in the left there is spiderman which kinda look like gambino
hiphopheads,not_removed,not really the picture isnt very clear
hiphopheads,not_removed,the cover art took over months to create if freddie gibbs released his album reveal three weeks ago do you really think logic had the time resources and money to first off even see freddie gibbs trailer think about a way he could do it similar write a damn script for his reveal hire actors and a studio then fucking edit it all in three weeks foh he woulda had his reveal done before gibbs
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not the biggest logic fan but as far as i know the album cover for everybody had been in the works for months theres no way he could have created the painting in weeks
hiphopheads,not_removed,or maybe freddie gibbs isnt the only person who knows about the last supper
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh freddie gibbs album cover looks like my asshole
hiphopheads,not_removed,this type of comment in a colelogic thread wow dude very original you sure brought a great comment to the table with this one
hiphopheads,not_removed,in all honesty man if you are not going to contribute to the discussion and do not care for either artist do not bother with a memethemed comment never understood the need for this
hiphopheads,not_removed,why is this of all things corny
hiphopheads,not_removed,its corny to think everything is corny
hiphopheads,not_removed,did anyone actually think that other than gibbs tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,fancy seeing you here dad
hiphopheads,not_removed,hi daddi
hiphopheads,not_removed,anytime either one of them is dropping a project there are rumors of the other being featured
hiphopheads,not_removed,no that guy just makes bad assumptions and calls them rumors
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah i just said slight chance i did not say theres good chance or anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope not tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,cole production is always possible
hiphopheads,not_removed,in apple music it shows that on both
hiphopheads,not_removed,source
hiphopheads,not_removed,check juicy js twitter he confirms its him
hiphopheads,not_removed,stay positive fellow logic fan
hiphopheads,not_removed,sorry bro i might have too much mountain dew there i love logic
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude stop im cumming
hiphopheads,not_removed,his stans
hiphopheads,not_removed,gibbs was saying he copied the album announcement video he didnt say anything about the cover art not saying he did or didnt copy tho i dont care
hiphopheads,not_removed,papa bless
hiphopheads,not_removed,daddy can we post puppers now
hiphopheads,not_removed,when did i say its a rumour can you read bud i said theres a slight chance just being hopeful
hiphopheads,not_removed,would be infinitely better than a feature
hiphopheads,not_removed,it says everbody documentary and the album was just announced fucking chill
hiphopheads,not_removed,its listed in the itunes album that isnt out yet soo no sauce
hiphopheads,not_removed,logic a shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,that everyone was calling logic out with shit like i hope gibbs gonna fuck him up same as he fucked jeezy logic is dead if gibbs gonna release a diss track
hiphopheads,not_removed,even if he did copy the announcment video logics is way better than gibbs
hiphopheads,not_removed,god i miss pupper time
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats wrong with coles features
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought you had another source with new info so i wanted to be updated you chill asshole
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is the correct way to reply to another human being thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea my brother is buying me beer this weekend and we can hella bump the new g eazy album
hiphopheads,not_removed,they think logic is for little kids but act like children themselves i prefer gibbs to logic but i could not take that thread seriously lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,corny
hiphopheads,not_removed,nothing he just wants to hop on this subs bandwagon
hiphopheads,not_removed,his production is way better than his rapping
hiphopheads,not_removed,hop in my chevy silverado and we can turn up to the new hoodie allen my guy
hiphopheads,not_removed,how dare you disrespect the sanctity of rfrankocean pupper time
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao nah he just bores me ill take another hiiipower tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,although i do believe he is at times not given enough credit for his production gomd was a great beat for example i respectfully disagree on the production being better
hiphopheads,not_removed,my mom doesnt let me drive with strangers im thirteen and i can rap as good as eminem
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay

hiphopheads,not_removed,ya the motto really gets me in my feels
hiphopheads,not_removed,posted this on one that got deleted just worth noting it is extremely rare for pitchfork to give an album best new music with an score this is definitely interesting to see
hiphopheads,not_removed,makes me wonder what is the criteria if they think its bnm worthy then it should be in the score as well interesting nonetheless
hiphopheads,not_removed,page slideshow 😂😂😂

hiphopheads,not_removed,nice
hiphopheads,not_removed,new album otw x httpstwittercommikewillmadeit leave above link unaltered messagecomposetotweetpostersubjectsuggestion httpsgithubcomjoealcorntweetposter httpsgithubcomjoealcorntweetposterissues
hiphopheads,not_removed,when mike will said it would be an ear drummer summer he wasnt lying
hiphopheads,not_removed,riff raff is one of the most ridiculous rappers in the world but damn i love listening to him
hiphopheads,not_removed,as a longtime raff fan who thinks hes had a decline in quality since neon icon this shit seems like a step back in the right direction tbh and actually a pretty good album if you like his music some of the songs bump word around town was probably my favorite you can tell hes starting to switch up his style definitely went for poppier vibes with hit me up which worked and root beer float ghost which i thought was a bit of a miss i really dug im not waiting on the summer as a step away from his usual style last track of the album bombs though unfortunately its early but i definitely enjoyed it more than peach panther and balloween
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey i was looking for your most recent comment on rkanye and i found this one and i was wondering keep in mind im being serious how do i take riff raff seriously as a rapper and all around artist because he has a couple songs i like but he just seems so gimmicky
hiphopheads,not_removed,alright bro i love riff raff but hes most definitely am acquired taste id start off listening to neon icon the album dolce gabbana if you can fuck with introducing the icon tip toe wing and dolce youre already basically there listen to aquaberry aquarius after and if it still doesnt click hes probably just not for you tbh i love the dude tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,chair still intact cant take this review seriously man sorry
hiphopheads,not_removed,this music video was all over the place bike shot didnt add to the story of the video who understands you melon man
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy motherfuck he gave it a
hiphopheads,not_removed,goddamn that was fucking quick for fantano
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah but he didnt even break his chair so who cares
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is one of fantanos weakest reviews this video was minutes long but it felt like he said absolutely nothing for all minutes he usually has great insight but this one just felt like he could have said whatever he wanted to say in minutes instead of
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think theres a good chance that in the context of the album the song is directed towards the character in the albumhimself hes mentioned that theres a religious aspect to the album and this is obviously reinforced in the video and there seems to be a theme of him being at the top of his game in the last two tracks so maybe the message will be that despite him being on top of the world which is depicted literally when hes bicycling on top of the globe he must humble himself before god and the greater theme of the album could be him reflecting on his position as the greatest rapper alive battling the ego that comes along with the title and finding humility in religion
hiphopheads,not_removed,as everyones saying itll be neat to see where it fits with the new album i remember thinking i couldnt have possibly fit on an album and have it make sense but kendrick proved us wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,minute review for a minute song stretchany viewtano here
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt understand why he kept calling those shots weird when those shots couldve been easily on a high budgeted tv show reviewing mvs not his forte i guess
hiphopheads,not_removed,im telling you kendrick could release a song of him taking a shit and fantano would be out here giving it a
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive been listening to humble literally nonstop since it released although the beat doesnt evolve its just incredibly well produced i am personally not sure how id react to an album full of modern sounding bangers like this even though it still manages to be different from most trap just excited to see the song in the context of the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,im mad at this part of the video where he clearly doesnt sync with i blew cool from ac and most of yall be fakin
hiphopheads,not_removed,leave it to melon head to use minutes to simply say not much is going on with this track no deep underlying meaning
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty much my thoughts on this its hilarious how reactionary rateyourmusic is to this
hiphopheads,not_removed,it blows my mind how many people think theres even a slight chance that kendrick is going to release a generic album with nothing but bangers this isnt drake its king kendrick this song is going to be great in the context of the album so just enjoy it for what it is no disrespect drake is life
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont need to watch it to know he probably wanked all over it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hate this guy idk why
hiphopheads,not_removed,there isnt much to say the track is really straightforward minute review
hiphopheads,not_removed,he missed the uzi vert reference too
hiphopheads,not_removed,kl looks like director krennic in that still of the music video
hiphopheads,not_removed,great review mr fantasmo
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like humble but i kinda hope its the beat switchpart of a better track
hiphopheads,not_removed,honest question why do people care so much about what fantano thinks of songsalbums what puts him above the rest in terms of holding his opinion in higher regard vs others
hiphopheads,not_removed,how do you spend eight minutes talking about this single
hiphopheads,not_removed,distinct lack of nipples and belly
hiphopheads,not_removed,i loved the bike scenes
hiphopheads,not_removed,my mans hairline is fucked look how far back it goes
hiphopheads,not_removed,i nearly spit water all over my laptop jesus christ lmfao
hiphopheads,not_removed,the song isnt nearly as deep as his other tracks so a lot of people have been able to make vids faster like biquint shawncee and antwon dehh where u at
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah unfortunately i agree fantano himself even said in the video that this song is very straightforward yet he still talked about it for almost minutes some of his album reviews arent even this long felt like he just got way to caught up in the kendrick hype and made this video too fast tbh he should not have even reviewed this song there is very little to gain out of it since the song was pretty linear or at least like you said made the video much much shorter
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah couple of good moments but padded out significantly with very obvious filler he clearly had some good ideas going into this review but it felt like he rushed to release it best moment when he actually talked about the track worst moment where he went on about the fisheye shot that he didnt like in the video feeling a strong to a light on this review
hiphopheads,not_removed,i give the review a strong to a light
hiphopheads,not_removed,he was just excited his favorite artist put out a single stan couldnt wait till the next day to put out a review
hiphopheads,not_removed,lets be honest the only purpose of uploading this was for him to nut over kendrick on camera and show the world how much he loves kendrick
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean the song probably cant even be delved into for minutes no matter how hard anybody could try i just think needle drops like longer format videos i mean the album reviews probably gonna be like minutes like tpab was so whadduya expect
hiphopheads,not_removed,feeling a light on this review
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is what almost all of his content feels like to me but i still get downvoted by his cult hhh following lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,he put it out in less than a day prolly didnt take enough time to edit his thoughts
hiphopheads,not_removed,you know thats actually the best hypothesis ive heard yet well find out in a week
hiphopheads,not_removed,did any of yall listen to gkmc that album is literally chock full of bangers and big slapping beats im just wondering if tpab was peoples first kendrick album and they think that hes always gonna make jazzy music which was different from the rest of his work
hiphopheads,not_removed,and the dude is still at the top of his game as the heart part shows i think he knows what hes doing and he knows what people would think with a song like this im not saying hes spinning some tpab type shit behind this but i have full faith in kenny to put out a project with amazing certified f u e g o rapping i cant wait
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think people forget that fantano shit on i when it was released as a single
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean so would this sub people act like hes jesus christ of hip hop like wtf
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was surprised more people werent pointing this out in the video thread because of the relatively closeup camera work it really stuck out to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was so confused at first i thought you were talking about him being of beat i just realized you where talking about lip syncing
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean i did that also
hiphopheads,not_removed,gotta search your soul to find out why fam hate away but try to know why good luck on your journey
hiphopheads,not_removed,this question is asked in literally every fantano thread if youre not trolling its due to his way with words a lot of his viewership find that his description of the music as well as his insight regarding concepts and such are interesting personally i hardly ever agree with the meat of his reviews but i find the peek into anothers wellstated opinions to be worth the watch
hiphopheads,not_removed,yall always gotta find something the criticize fantano for dont you its like he didnt say anything controversial in this video so you gotta complain about the video length instead
hiphopheads,not_removed,he talked about the video too
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly i dont know he kinda got his point across in minutes at least he spoke out against the people that are whining again about kdot changing his sound or whatever
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree deserved fifteen minutes
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love that quint talked so highly of this chair and gave respect to his past chairs i wonder when the service will beto send the current chair home
hiphopheads,not_removed,his face reminds me when you go to grab the last piece of pizza and its gone
hiphopheads,not_removed,totally rushed just wanted to get the vid out there i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,to your last point it was probably to appease his fans and such since a kendrick related video would net a lot of views
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah he should have just waited for the tracks of the week video i think he just wanted to comment on the video itself though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think hes just really excited about the album like we all are i dont mind him sharing his excitement for minutes ive been doing basically the same thing to my friends all last nightthis morning
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think he said a lot actually he talked about this single and related it to singles that kendrick had releases in the past and their impressions as well as the singles place on the upcoming albums he related peoples reactions to that of backseat freestyle and i and how this single has potential to fit into the album and make more sense once it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a straightforward song simple beat proceeds to talk about the track for over minutes
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay i shouldnt have said bangers its not the sonics of the album im really talking about though i do dislike the beat on humble its the subject matter
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was a long ass time ago since then fantanos treating every single song kennys put out as perfection
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wuz lookin at de bakgroun n stoff nigga
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think cause hes making money doing something that he likes and something id possibly enjoy doing while i work a stupid job damn im a hater also i think hes arrogant and he said some stupid shit about race that rubbed me the wrong way
hiphopheads,not_removed,minutes isnt even that long either lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,these reviewers give us so many hours of quality discussion rhhh should chip in and get quint a new chair and fantano a shirt that fits
hiphopheads,not_removed,you guys are literally reviewing a track review lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,backseat freestyle without the context of the album is just another ego rap banger but its purpose within the album completely changes its meaning
hiphopheads,not_removed,he dropped backseat freestyle before gkmc and king kunta before tpab which were very similar tracks to this one imho i really cant see kendrick dropping an album entirely full of bland swag rap it would be a total departure from the rest of his life as an artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,he gave uu an but tbh every song kenny puts out is perfection so idk what youre arguing
hiphopheads,not_removed,you got a point or nah kdot is perfection fammo
hiphopheads,not_removed,this was an amazing thread of insightfulness and selfawareness good vibes
hiphopheads,not_removed,what has he said about race out of curiosity
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a needledrop fan drop everything to watch his videos etc etc but the dude is pretty arrogant and ive heard some bad stories about him
hiphopheads,not_removed,see i dont think your comment was all that well planned out i think you could have worked on it a bit more its a shame since your comments are usually insightful and thoughtful
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey buddy did you hear the news its track reviews reviews
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres something different about it though maybe i just wasnt used to kendricks style then so its nostalgia but if you put bf up next to humble humble still feels a lot more simplistic and easy to me not sure what it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,bland this is a great banger for what it is kennys flows and verse are great man kenny has cursed himself
hiphopheads,not_removed,right like i dont get the schtick a music reviewer gives an overwhelming amount of positive reviews towards an artist who consistently puts out good music who would have thought
hiphopheads,not_removed,but tbh every song kenny puts out is perfection so idk what youre arguing both the heart part iv and humble are nowhere near as good as the rest of his discography and half of the songs off uu were mediocre at best
hiphopheads,not_removed,its honestly been like years and i cant find the video anymore nor can i remember what he said so i should prolly just strike that out i sort of remember him saying shit like appropriation is bullshit and sjws should just get over it and i was like ok im not an sjw but relax cause ppl bite black folk style and culture real hard
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah id like to know too
hiphopheads,not_removed,your review of the review of the review of the track really failed to capture the essence of shitposting that permeates this sub wouldnt bother upvoting again
hiphopheads,not_removed,and no trap influence hard light
hiphopheads,not_removed,it is impossible to analyze backseat freestyle outside of the context of the album though this is the same stuff people were saying about backseat freestyle before gkmc
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i meant bland by the standards of kendrick i like this song too but a whole album like it would be a huge step down in quality from his past releases
hiphopheads,not_removed,agree to disagree man my only point is that fantano hasnt treated every song kendrick has put out as perfection based on his review of uu
hiphopheads,not_removed,uu songs were great tracks b unt and and and were one of my fave songs last year
hiphopheads,not_removed,leaving this here just in case he answers
hiphopheads,not_removed,no trapflavored instrumentals
hiphopheads,not_removed,fair enough i might have had a different approach though because when i got into gkmc i was a waaaaay more casual hiphop listener so i definitely wasnt going through it picking up on the cohesive elements the way i do with an album now i would mostly skip around and listen to the few standout tracks that clicked with me initially bf being one of them it never struck me as one of these typical braggy rap tracks the way humble sort of does
hiphopheads,not_removed,lecrae leon bridges sound great together dope track
hiphopheads,not_removed,jesus what a lineup
hiphopheads,not_removed,ohhh yes damn vic on the intro edit im going to take an extended lunch to peep this edit pusha t brought me back to africa then the south on the run to the north meek was too loud and too fast ill try to listen closer second time around songs in and this is the best album of motherfucking tity boi ok im not going back to work
hiphopheads,not_removed,this entire thing is flames
hiphopheads,not_removed,how hasnt this gotten more attention solid
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres no way this is the real soundtrack for the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i heard it on the radio yesterday and knew it was new but couldnt find out where it was from welp now i know this whole album great
hiphopheads,not_removed,i need to revisit hotel paranoia
hiphopheads,not_removed,doubt its a tape but im not complaining if it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,jacuzzi
hiphopheads,not_removed,marauding in paradise is one of my favorite mixtapes but i wasnt really feeling hotel paranoia it felt like he was trying to be too many rappers at once and couldnt really hone what his style is im hoping his next project is a little more focused because i havent been floored by a mixtape like that in a while
hiphopheads,not_removed,jazz been quiet as hell since his last project i remember he had so much hype around here when marauding in paradise dropped was hotel paranoia that underwhelming i feel like i havent heard his name in a good ass minute
hiphopheads,not_removed,hotel paranoia was fantastic very excited for his future
hiphopheads,not_removed,hope this is a tape loved both of his last projects
hiphopheads,not_removed,i enjoyed his music but he never really held my attention for much time
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck yeah jazz is so underrated id never heard of him til i saw him at rolling loud and he absolutely tore the house down
hiphopheads,not_removed,same it was a decent ass tape but it somehow just fell out of rotation
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt really find any identity issues with hp but it does have some of his weaker work like how we do it and after the club i think its a great project and though i think it was stepdown from mip generally this tape had an higher quality average of its bangers than his previous project but theres where he maybe shouldve done different less bangers and more diversity like mip take rose quartz like crazy its far from a banger but the lyrics and the darker beat with a great switch along with his voice and delivery on that just makes it one of his best tracks imo i hope hell do more of that and maybe more like the downtown cliche where hes experimenting with his voice he could strive for more cohesion in his next project like mip but i think his style is pretty clear and dont think his trying to bite many others sure the hook on red alert kinda gave me fetty vibes but not much other than that i really dont agree with much of the travis scott comparisons im really excited for his next project he can definitely improve but i dont think hp is the stepback some people think it to be
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really liked both projects mip was a lot better imo but i still love hotel paranoia i agree with you though i think his reasoning was that if he put a bunch of mainstream bangers on a tape one of them would blow up and hed get more famous i hope his next project is like mip and hotel paranoia
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats for a show hes doing in toronto on december
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes been touring a lot and has only dropped three tracks after hp but hes gotten a lot bigger since that bigger interviews the bigger blogs are onto him now he was touring with post malone he got a shoutout from lil wayne red alert was supposed be on the suicide squad soundtrack and it was just used in a trailer for the crew videogame before he dropped hp people was just catching onto him and he had a very strong buildup to the project with that website with the crypitic shit we had to figure out etc after that hes hasnt done much very newsworthy that will reach the top of the frontpage of hhhs with him as an upandcomer he also dropped hp very early and almost right after he dropped the kanye buildup started drake started to tease views etc and has been crazy overall so can see why he slipped off some minds i dont think it has anything to do with how the project tourned out because i think the general consensus is that its dope project
hiphopheads,not_removed,he dropped a few a singles lil wayne waste just in case
hiphopheads,not_removed,highly recommend one of my favorite tapes of the year
hiphopheads,not_removed,how we do it is so dope imo given how he sampled the hook and slick rick
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with all of this good assessment im hyped for new music next week whatever it is though
hiphopheads,not_removed,still a new track but yea
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit didnt even realize he had a show plannedday before my birthday too guess im going and gettin fucked up on a thursday lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah dope samples but i dont really like the vocal direction he took with it i think some downtown clicheesque vocals would be better instead of auotune yelling
hiphopheads,not_removed,how we do it is not in the project its just a soundcloud track
hiphopheads,not_removed,its still a part of the project track but due to sampling issues its cut from spotify etc but its still on the soundcloud version of the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,my bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,same as rose quartslike crazy love that song
hiphopheads,not_removed,is this what adhd feels like
hiphopheads,not_removed,unfortunately yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao this funny havent heard a good parody
hiphopheads,not_removed,no fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,so hyped for this album this is my favorite type of production and its awesome to hear games softer side
hiphopheads,not_removed,really hope he delivers with this album that stupid contrived beef left a horrible taste in my mouth love the game but sometimes he makes it hard to be a fan
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao its all for publicity drake prolly wont respond to this shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,this shit disrespectful as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope he kidnaps her
hiphopheads,not_removed,why would he not respond to kendrick but respond to xxxtentacles
hiphopheads,not_removed,good
hiphopheads,not_removed,hahaha ok this made me a chuckle drake like superman trying to race against the clock to save his mom from lex luther
hiphopheads,not_removed,i doubt drake will respond to anyone
hiphopheads,not_removed,found this while trying to track down the interview where tumay talks about the first time young thug and travis scott performed skyfall as mentioned by in the post of the video of that performance earlier today also saw that the video was posted a couple of months ago here but didnt see the transcript so thought i would post this so more people could read it as i found it really interesting
hiphopheads,not_removed,his mixing is dope but he sounds like a douchebag edit actually i retract that cus ive only heard him talk when he told his story about mixing jeffery in an uber and he sounded super fucking pretentious
hiphopheads,not_removed,wayne was so raww
hiphopheads,not_removed,havent listened to the radio besides npr in several years
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh tone down the self promotion this place is for an appreciation of the craft not to push your mix tape
hiphopheads,not_removed,eminem really gotta switch up his hat game
hiphopheads,not_removed,eminem must be honoured redman is a legend one of the most consistent mcs in the heavyweight era that was the if you havent heard whut thee album youre missing out hombre
hiphopheads,not_removed,out of all the things to be jelly about when it comes to eminem highest selling rapper of all time highest selling rap album of all time most best album grammies great kids huge house lots of money genius etc this shit has me steaming i collect hip hop paraphernalia and id kill for this
hiphopheads,not_removed,his middle name must be fuck you
hiphopheads,not_removed,was expecting a deathsquad cat
hiphopheads,not_removed,he better have offered it to meth first
hiphopheads,not_removed,nice present from a far superior rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk if that will top em and dre from the early
hiphopheads,not_removed,eminem has a lot of couples royce yelawolf shame redman and eminem havent worked together more hopping his in the new album
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah hasnt he learned dad hats are whats in right now smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,is that a tarboush
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmaoo
hiphopheads,not_removed,he looks like a shriner
hiphopheads,not_removed,soprano heads whats gooooood fucking ritchie janice did him good
hiphopheads,not_removed,the jackeeeeeeeeeeet
hiphopheads,not_removed,a big portion of time killing for me involves watching sopranos clips on youtube
hiphopheads,not_removed,redman and masta ace have the clearest influence on ems style imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,eh its definitely a two way street both have to feel honoured to be able to interact with one another
hiphopheads,not_removed,my favorite he has is a photo he took of redmans house before em got famous i guess he went to nj with bizarre and others and took a photo outside redmans crib and once redman found out he signed it pretty recently
hiphopheads,not_removed,the man has a successful radio station in an era where radio is dying
hiphopheads,not_removed,emifuckyounem
hiphopheads,not_removed,is this a redban reference
hiphopheads,not_removed,as a long time redman stan i would say they are pretty lateral in terms of skill id maybe even give eminem the advantage
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol i can almost guarantee redman wont be on the album dont worry tho youll get sia rihanna
hiphopheads,not_removed,shut the fuck up
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes a daddoes that make all his hats dad hats
hiphopheads,not_removed,i want to see him wear a kufi now
hiphopheads,not_removed,those who want respect give respect
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats richie aprile not jackie
hiphopheads,not_removed,why not just watch sopranos
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats fucking amazing yeah i remember reading about how eminem actually collects hip hop shit too
hiphopheads,not_removed,this too
hiphopheads,not_removed,olive garden butthole
hiphopheads,not_removed,possibly and id give redman the advantage in discography by far actually
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe even skylar grey if were lucky
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,unfortunately probably true prolly another kendrick feature too that being said i wouldnt doubt em getting redman on a bme track or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,redman and eminem only had like years of overlap in selling records as far as im concerned off the wall is their only collab which is a shame since they are huge fans of one another
hiphopheads,not_removed,what about pink
hiphopheads,not_removed,o shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,yoooo you are right wtf jackie got taken out by vito
hiphopheads,not_removed,because then you have to commit to watching a full episode
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have twice
hiphopheads,not_removed,eh after malpractice and blackout redman has a huge gap in quality id prefer eminems new stuff to redmans new stuff that being said there is no clear winner in each of their first three solo albums to me maybe el niño and blackout give red a slightly better number
hiphopheads,not_removed,fack
hiphopheads,not_removed,only current day em could take one of the hottest rappers in the game and get that bad of a song out of it
hiphopheads,not_removed,if i punch myself and it hurts does it mean im weak or strong
hiphopheads,not_removed,redmans first three albums are certified classics bro and he never needed to pander and make clearly radio friendly pop bs i enjoy ems first three but those singles im talking about take away from the completeness of his projects as for their later albums idk i stop listening to rappers once they leave their prime
hiphopheads,not_removed,i actually really liked love game what was so bad about it both of them had a lot of energy and some really really funny lines i was surprised just how funny kendrick could be when compared to such a hyper active tongue n cheek rapper like eminem he really held his own although eminems second verse is just fucking blistering
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre insane the way i am and stan were two of the most anti pop songs that because worldwide hits youre kinda desperate to show you love red tho so ill let you be
hiphopheads,not_removed,eminem pushed boundaries more than reggie did in his singles different times with different followings people wanted the counter culture with em i dont consider his old singles to be shitty pop its good pop if anything i still love just dont hive a fuck my name is stan and without me i dont think any of his hits catered to some poppy culture he made a new one
hiphopheads,not_removed,just an extremely corny song but ive come to expect it from em unfortunately
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah love game is number for me evil twin has got to be number though its one of his best songs in years
hiphopheads,not_removed,hahaha did you guys see this he answered a question with options with yes yes wasnt even an option
hiphopheads,not_removed,what about it was corny it was supposed to have a lot of funny and hammy lines thats kind of what he does you dont have to like it im not saying you are wrong or anything but that song felt very old em in terms of how funny it was to me without any edgy lol raping my own mom jokes which is a plus for an older me who doesnt really find edgy stuff that funny anymore i mean the dude literally rapped while giving metaphoric head as a future spouse also used to be my fiance til you sucked on wayne andre and kanye lebron akon jay lil jon raekwon mae polow tha don dre dante ross james conway kwame guess im gettin my ggod dang jigga on eh cause your name im beyond sayin i dont know i was laughing getting my jigga on your name is beyondsaying beyonce like thats fucking funny thats a funny punch its corny but hes a year old dude making rap music he cant take himself seriously and if he does then yall would just yell at him for trying to hard what do yall want from the poor guy lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,rmadlads
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,ur weird
hiphopheads,not_removed,the beat is awful to me at least thats definitely the worst part i just dont find his funny songs to be good songs he pushes it too far and it just sounds childish a la fack it was clever rhyme wise but the subject matter made it literal trash
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol im getting downvoted feelsbad yeah i dont like the beat either but its serviceable for the verses fack is horrible just a really bad unfunny song again i think theres a difference between screaming and yelling about sticking gerbils up asses in pretty uncreative and boring ways and telling a pretty funny overthetop story about your girlfriend trying to kill you and then you trying to kill her its pretty funny to me especially since its catchy and is fun to rap along to it has some really impressive parts technically too every girl ive ever had either says i got too much baggage or im too fucking dramatic man what the fuck is the matter im just a fucking romantic i fucking love you you fucking bitch combative possessive in fact last time i was mad at an ex i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events i said hit the road and after she left i sent that bitch a text i said be careful driving dont read this and have an accident she glanced to look at it and wrecked too bad thought we had a connect no sense dwelling makes never been a more compelling case but yeah i totally get not feeling the song cause of the beat ems recent beat choices have been pretty trash if im honest i dont care all too much as long as they arent distractingly bad they dont bother me i care more about like lyricism and shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah its hard to defend eminems recent stuff here without being downvoted lol i can understand that reasoning just doesnt do it for me i guess
hiphopheads,not_removed,that makes sense i adore the dude i think hes better now than he ever has been for me but i can see why people dislike his production and flow since its pretty niche and battle rapy obviously he gets mad props in the battle rap community due to how intense his lyricism is and how much inspiration he takes from that community
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy fuck this is incredible i just turned the lights off in my room and spun around like an idiot looking at everything but this is one of the coolest things i can recall an artist doing in a really long time donald is so fucking innovative say what you will about his music
hiphopheads,not_removed,iphone app hasnt been updated at the time of this comment as far as i can see looks dope though is it his full concert or just a curated video of the entire event in general edit its updated now and it appears to just be the first song
hiphopheads,not_removed,so far its only the one song but its super cool even on only a google cardboard
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck i love this donald continues to amaze me
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly was hoping some artist would find a way to use degree recorded video somehow within their work this was cool cant watch the whole thing too loud at work
hiphopheads,not_removed,the app isnt available in europe why the fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,this was so cool fuck i wish i was at that show
hiphopheads,not_removed,this shit is so crazy if you look down you can even see the floor of the concert venue
hiphopheads,not_removed,wont work with my bluetooth headphones anyone else having the same problem
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo this is so fucking awesome so gambino for always making innovative moves
hiphopheads,not_removed,does it let you watched video from the concert including seeing people who attended my phone is too shitty and it tells me it cant support the video playback
hiphopheads,not_removed,first the bti script now this wew
hiphopheads,not_removed,it works now
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was dope with just some headphones between this and whatever the interactive vinyl joint is i think don is really trying to do something special with the rollout itd be dope if he put all of his pharos performance out to buy for a decent price
hiphopheads,not_removed,have you never seen a music video theyre pretty common first one i can think of off the top of my head is roses by jazz cartier
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just downloaded it in denmark
hiphopheads,not_removed,and if you look in front of you gambinos performing the song
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah the floor thing freaked me out how the fuck does that work
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes you can look around and see the people in the front row
hiphopheads,not_removed,mike shinoda did one for welcome
hiphopheads,not_removed,i remember the desert car video if thats the one youre talking about i dont listen to the dude that much since his debut fell flat with all that hype i was thinking more of their live work but i should have mentioned that earlier still dope though
hiphopheads,not_removed,run the jewels also did one
hiphopheads,not_removed,ayy its available now
hiphopheads,not_removed,feel bad for the girl on the right the lighting wasnt very flattering
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow i really wish i could watch it on my phone
hiphopheads,not_removed,check out my music any feed back is accepted
hiphopheads,not_removed,this guys fan base on twitter is ridiculously loyal hes kinda generic and has a weak flow for me though
hiphopheads,not_removed,how is this getting no love
hiphopheads,not_removed,so hyped for this will make the inevitable l from frank tomorrow a little easier
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wish she told us what time it was dropping today
hiphopheads,not_removed,mi gusta
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont even know what to expect going into this big noname fan but im staying cautiously optimistic still very excited
hiphopheads,not_removed,hopefully in the afternoon
hiphopheads,not_removed,lupe on mural is one of if not the most impressive i have seen minutes of solid bars and he can perform it live what more could you want
hiphopheads,not_removed,blacklicious alphabet aerobics az lifes a bitch andre on sixteen big noyd on give up the goods ra the rugged man uncommon valor jay elec on exhibit c nas ny state of mind kendrick on control inspectah deck triumph just off the top im sure im missing some obvious ones
hiphopheads,not_removed,when i saw you mention andre i couldnt resist mentioning his iconic second verse on the aquemini song he swings his vocals between the beats while maintaining a pretty dope rhyme scheme a classic
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think kanyes vma performance is extremely dope after taylor swifts bitchy song he comes on the stage in all red with gold chains singing about praising douchebags also him playing with the little beat thing i dont know what its called live is dope then push comes on aggressive and arrogant drops his douchebag verse confidentlydouchebag as in relation the songs themes and walks off stage and kanye using the vocoder live was stellar
hiphopheads,not_removed,black thought on freddie gibbs extradite strong flow good imagery and manages to elicit feelings of hope and despair very neatly
hiphopheads,not_removed,i watched a video of death grips performing somewhere in florida once the crowd was nuts the frontman was hype analog drums it was the closest to a punk show ive seen made me nostalgic as for verses one of my favorites is mf dooms verse on wise owl by child of lov
hiphopheads,not_removed,we all die one day
hiphopheads,not_removed,got my mind made up kurupt new york new york or smooth or dogg dayz afternoon fucking kurupt in general
hiphopheads,not_removed,christ conscious joey bada
hiphopheads,not_removed,cappadonnas verse on winter warz
hiphopheads,not_removed,mf doom thats that or even meat grinder
hiphopheads,not_removed,a ton of meechy darko verses specifically
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes that one is great another recent one is game on bars
hiphopheads,not_removed,i went to a death grips concert last year still cant believe they actually came to europe anyways it was almost surreal they came on stage music began to blast ride screamed his lungs out for like minutes and after guillotine they ran off stage and the lights came on people were moshing the entire time it was crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,death grips was the first concert i ever went to and is still the best they set the bar really really high
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn this shit hot
hiphopheads,not_removed,heaters on deck
hiphopheads,not_removed,bro i need more of that in my life oh god
hiphopheads,not_removed,the culture will really strive with this contribution
hiphopheads,not_removed,why did you include exclamation points his current music is trash and this mixtape will be too
hiphopheads,not_removed,ik i kinda posted it as a joke
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is the az kind of impressed if it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,really love a good alchemist beat like this good ass track especially since twelvy and dah are some of my favorites out rn
hiphopheads,not_removed,azs rhyme schemes are always on point these guys could learn a thing or two from him
hiphopheads,not_removed,where the cozy tape at
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck the hebrews
hiphopheads,not_removed,not bad i liked lybb and dirty glock better but this is good always excited for new twelvyy wonder when that projects dropping
hiphopheads,not_removed,ohhh i heard this somewhere i believe in one of mobs flex freestyles dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,az has some amazing solo material
hiphopheads,not_removed,according to ferg it should be soon they shot the album cover and most of the songs are done according to this
hiphopheads,not_removed,you mean baby glock
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep al tweeted he held obto this one for awhile
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think he means impressed that he is featuring on the song forsomeone like twelvyy
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol yes i do
hiphopheads,not_removed,idek
hiphopheads,not_removed,how has he not shaved that stache off yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,the album was probably half done at that point
hiphopheads,not_removed,rgaybros rpopheads we out there
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not sure if rlistentothis is on the front page if it is then hhh is the only one in the top that had organic growth from someone who has been apart of this sub since subs im proud to have witnessed this
hiphopheads,not_removed,so rteamsesh rtrap rfrankocean rindieheads
hiphopheads,not_removed,what about rdrizzy rkanye and rweeknd
hiphopheads,not_removed,wheres rkanye
hiphopheads,not_removed,god bless this sub and rvinyl rmusic is soo bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,you missed rrnbheads
hiphopheads,not_removed,im surprised dubstep is still so high up thought that died down in
hiphopheads,not_removed,if rkanye was on here is would be in between trap and futurebeats subs
hiphopheads,not_removed,rindieheads has
hiphopheads,not_removed,rtrap we out here
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,funny how rdeathgrips has more subs than rtheweeknd not that im trynna take away from death grips theyre good but the weeknd is just so damn popular
hiphopheads,not_removed,so youre saying were two more subreddits away from potentially becoming the shittiest subreddit just kidding but in all seriousness i love this sub and hope it continues to have its success but id hate it to become into something like rmusic have complete snobs dont get me wrong we have our own snobs too but not as bad as them
hiphopheads,not_removed,can we go double platinum no features
hiphopheads,not_removed,reddit didnt exist in the century dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,it is not
hiphopheads,not_removed,seriously we at a solid plus
hiphopheads,not_removed,in the waves
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think youre serious but for the benefit of everyone else rkanye is a shitpost sub
hiphopheads,not_removed,whenever a subreddit becomes a default the sub just goes to shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,dubstep is still extremely popular it has just fallen out of the mainstream
hiphopheads,not_removed,skrillex type dubstep isnt really traditional to be fair though
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,what all the the artist subreddits talk about the artist and their fandom more than the music its as much as a music sub as most other artist subs music gets posted when it comes out the difference is rkanye is actually very active why should that be penalised
hiphopheads,not_removed,well obviously youre gonna get better discussion if people are voluntarily subbing to a subreddit rather than if theyre automatically subbed
hiphopheads,not_removed,the top post of all time is a picture of a chair
hiphopheads,not_removed,so
hiphopheads,not_removed,time stamp
hiphopheads,not_removed,not sure but the radio broadcast aired at pacific time
hiphopheads,not_removed,the fuck did i just watch
hiphopheads,not_removed,i for one thought it was dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,when you just learn how to edit
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw your comment and figured it cant be that weird but what the fuck was that lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh come on dont act like this wasnt well done
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt even finish it i was too busy looking for whatever drug i forgot i took
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt mean it as in the editing was poor rather its pretty over the top
hiphopheads,not_removed,man its kinda hard to listen to this after everything we have been blessed with this evening
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought this shit banged song is a jam
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to bhudda and tell me g eazy didnt take drakes borrowed flow from x lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn watching the video of guala just made me laugh but loandbehold listened to just the song a few times and it might start to be growing on me as a banger
hiphopheads,not_removed,puts out a song album first songs are exactly the same definitely hard to listen to
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i gotta agree with that especially cause humble and everybody is actually them trying this is g eazy just having a little fun
hiphopheads,not_removed,facts im a g eazy stan but this shit was all the same
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol did he haha i wasnt being serious tho lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,midway through the second song i started wondering if this was four versions of the same single
hiphopheads,not_removed,bonafide classic prime jay over the catchiest beat i can imagine
hiphopheads,not_removed,where the heems remix at
hiphopheads,not_removed,if u guys havent listen through his entire discography its super concise
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a leaked version of too bad i have to destroy you now by kid cudi with a kanye verse
hiphopheads,not_removed,is this legit like a legit demo version edit yup sounds legit
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think travi scott was supposed to be on this too maybe he came in after the fadeout
hiphopheads,not_removed,its down anyone have a mirror
hiphopheads,not_removed,im imagining cudi stans listening to this with their new found hatred of kanye and commenting how kanye doesnt even rap in english anymore not realizing what a reference track is
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpssoundcloudcomtheyoungdirtysavagecantlookinmyeyesfeatkidcudidemo
hiphopheads,not_removed,seems like they squashed it tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think cudi stans are just torn and heart broken not hating ye
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is like a half finished verse where hes clearly making sounds for the flow and all that
hiphopheads,not_removed,they did
hiphopheads,not_removed,kanyes the only who squashed any beef noone knows if they spoke or what cudi feels about the whole thing until i see something from cudi i expect hes still being a little bitch about it
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is too bad seems like such a chill dude hopefully it doesnt affect his tour too much and he can get back on track he puts on such a high energy awesome show much love to him and his crew
hiphopheads,not_removed,brutal these guys are by no means rich thats a major blow
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is super shitty i cant imagine what it would feel like to lose everything like that especially some things that are possibly irreplaceable like the stuff on that hard drive ill have to make sure to hit up the calgary stop of his tour and show some support if he can make it into canada in time
hiphopheads,not_removed,why did they leave all that shit in the car money seriously
hiphopheads,not_removed,cos they didnt expect to be robbed
hiphopheads,not_removed,when i have my expensive stuff with me i never leave it in the car
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is so dope honestly i knew the asher roth remix before this lol but theyre both such dope songs love some common his new album is dope if anyone hasnt checked it out yet it exceded my expectations like crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,one of my all time favorite common songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,my heart goes out to anyone that cant appreciate this
hiphopheads,not_removed,such a underrated rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know right
hiphopheads,not_removed,did you just reply to your own comment
hiphopheads,not_removed,havent heard this in forever thanks for this lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,which came out three days ago and the fresh tag is for songs that came out within the last week
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a fair compromise
hiphopheads,not_removed,eh im a pretty big fan of all three but at this point tupac and biggie have been dead for years and outkast havent put out an album together for are we really gonna be mad some young people dont know their songs when a good chunk were either not born or still in elementary school when they stopped putting out music one of the members of the beastie boys said the good thing about hip hop was the new generation didnt have to give a fuck about the past they can go out and try to do their own thing thats brand new without regards to who came before them and that causes music to evolve if you apperciate the past and can get inspiration from it thats great but the genre is better because not everyone is going out and making album long love letters to past stars like kendrick did do your own thing do something new if you like some old shit thats good too
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit no one hear knows the fuck an outkast is
hiphopheads,not_removed,im and i can only name outkast songs i know bob ms jackson hey yeah the way you move and so fresh and so clean
hiphopheads,not_removed,i recommend listening to atliens and aquemini shit will change your life songs like da art of storytellin aquemini two dope boyz atliens skew it on the bar b rosa parks elevators wheelz of steel and return of the g are all classics to me just to name a few
hiphopheads,not_removed,ghost by with you ft vince
hiphopheads,not_removed,first time recording lemme know what you think
hiphopheads,not_removed,trey soongz lmao sorry about that
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake and kanye would be my dream tape to come out even tho its a long shot or kodak x metro would be so amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,waka flocka flame
hiphopheads,not_removed,perfect
hiphopheads,not_removed,i got scared for life
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is sadly being slept on one of the best beats on the show
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is actually one of the tightest rhythm roulettes theyve put out up there with wonders
hiphopheads,not_removed,hahah yea frank album lol releasing lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,time to accept the l and move on
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wonder what comes out first frank album or jay electronica album or neither probably neither
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant believe its been one entire year of frank stans hoping for an album release i honestly dont know if were all stupid for thinking something would actually come out or be proud for placing so much trust in the most confusing artist of alltime
hiphopheads,not_removed,accept the l and listen to pnd comes out in aug so
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just wanna feel loved
hiphopheads,not_removed,boycottfrank
hiphopheads,not_removed,does anyone think frank might go on tour with kanye if the album actually drops
hiphopheads,not_removed,what if there isnt an album at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,n o v e m b e r
hiphopheads,not_removed,something something half life
hiphopheads,not_removed,at least frank already put out an album wtf jay
hiphopheads,not_removed,detox
hiphopheads,not_removed,at least telefones coming today
hiphopheads,not_removed,my album will come out first
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought jay doesnt do albums he just releases individual tracks whenever he wants
hiphopheads,not_removed,by the time it comes out well all be dead or have dementia and all the new kids will have no clue who this guy is
hiphopheads,not_removed,he would probably go out on his own tour maybe do one night with kanye frank ocean and kanye in one night would sell out in seconds
hiphopheads,not_removed,why do that when he can literally sell out arenas and get tens of millions more in the end frank doesnt need kanye to sell out a tour and vice versa i am willing to bet good money kanye is going to take desiigner and maybe some of the lesser known good artists people from his camp like pushatravisbig sean on tour with him
hiphopheads,not_removed,what makes you say that
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes got his style wars ep which is great
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk man frank is a wavy dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,kanye already sells out in seconds he doesnt need frank tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,on the tumblr post with all of the release dates november was the only future date besides the jul
hiphopheads,not_removed,well i guess well see
hiphopheads,not_removed,why are you giving me hope
hiphopheads,not_removed,curreny must live in the studio
hiphopheads,not_removed,on of the only guys i know that can keep up with or even exceed guccis work ethic while at the same time putting out quality material edit spelling
hiphopheads,not_removed,curreny has some of the best production and he flows so nicely over everything whether its trap beats or smooth jazzy production he just knows what to choose and how rhyme over them so nicely im so happy spitta as dropped a tape every month every tape has had something that ive loved
hiphopheads,not_removed,how many tapes is that this year stoned on ocean legend of harvard blue andretti weed instrumentals i know im missing a couple
hiphopheads,not_removed,month after month after month
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just wish spitta released his tapes on apple music so i could keep up lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,spitta i love spitta
hiphopheads,not_removed,new pack of music
hiphopheads,not_removed,spitta constantly putting out quality music
hiphopheads,not_removed,spitta always blessing the streets with music to smoke and ride to support the man when he comes thru your city buy tickets and when he drops an album pay the
hiphopheads,not_removed,curreny just dont stop releasing that heat
hiphopheads,not_removed,if only this year had a million more months curreny is now my favourite rapper no doubt
hiphopheads,not_removed,god damn this bitch slaps spittas flow is insane on this one
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you had told me last year that an artist could release a decent quality project nearly every month of the year i would have told you to vote for trump so you could someday be more wrong about something than that statement and yet here we are
hiphopheads,not_removed,yup
hiphopheads,not_removed,aaaaaand its a dud currenys music died in except
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you watch raps n lowriders it seems like hes never in the studio
hiphopheads,not_removed,he just makes each one of these tapes in like a week every month
hiphopheads,not_removed,i am pretty sure a lot of rappers have enough material to do the same they just decide not to from a management perspective
hiphopheads,not_removed,uicideboy last year was putting out a tape a month and now are on a bimonthly schedule
hiphopheads,not_removed,the owners manual carrollton heist revolver bourbon street secrets weed and instrumentals
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes released something every month since december
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think its somewhat costly to do that because he used plenty of samples and if he decides to generate revenue from it then hed have to clear samples
hiphopheads,not_removed,revolver stones on ocean legend of harvard blue are on apple music
hiphopheads,not_removed,niggas dont even know the kind of work horse that spitta is he floods the game year round
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty sure his plan was to release one every month this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes on mixtapes this year pretty insane when you think about it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i will curreny still puts no effort in this trash tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not like they are throwaways too those dont exist with spitta
hiphopheads,not_removed,its just not for you then doesnt mean its trash
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont know why curreny fans arent seeing the huge drop in quality
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a huge spitta fan and i somewhat agree that it isnt on par from what he used to drop verde terrace priest andretti new jet city covert coup stoned immaculate even that being said he does have a very particular fan base and most of them would be thrilled with the consistency
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck him
hiphopheads,not_removed,all of his fans are delusional though look at that like to dislike ratio
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh man i love that track definitely one of dooms best feature parts dillas beat just fits so perfectly and bj is awesome too sadly he is quite underrated
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wonder how many great beats like this dilla has just lying around unreleased
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love how old dooms voice seems so aggressive now i think its really cool how his voice has changed since his kmd days till now
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is that kickbackfeelgoodpositivityandvibes kinda mood always open to suggestions to add onto this
hiphopheads,not_removed,artist title you had one job bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,nastys world telephone calls put that on my set and london town more for the beat are my favorite songs again aap rocky sounds way more more better than the rest of his crew to the point they became irrelevant and boring probably my opinion will change in the future after more listening but for now i dont really feel it
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats uhok guys
hiphopheads,not_removed,is dah still in aap mob
hiphopheads,not_removed,what happened to that track with uzi rocky quavo and carti
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont understand how in this day and age we cant get worldwide simultaneous releases for things like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont change stores to view it just signed me out of my apple music membership and now i have to re download all my songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,tracks with rocky are a yay tracks without him are a nay
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit dj smokeys got a track on this
hiphopheads,not_removed,not fucking with this tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol dude its an album
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant edit it
hiphopheads,not_removed,how does it compare to lord never worry to you
hiphopheads,not_removed,was really fucking surprised to see onyx in there i bet that shit is some of yams doing perfect for the vibe nast has as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,prolly the australian itunes with the australian dollar just look at the individual song prices cant be the american one
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not out in the us yet relax
hiphopheads,not_removed,was he ever an official mob member or just sort of affiliated
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was really hoping for a feature from him on this one
hiphopheads,not_removed,was never a member just an affiliate the in his name throws people off
hiphopheads,not_removed,what nastys world bangs but i agree about the other two songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,which track was smokey
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah lol its actually hilarious that he didnt realize that this was an album lol lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,you done goofed boy
hiphopheads,not_removed,not op but i feel like this tape surpassed it i didnt like vert or yachty but every other feature brought their a game its an aap mob tape so i didnt expect anyone to get super lyrical but every song bangs my favorites are telephone calls nastys world and way hii also you can feel yams was really involved in this tape there was no bullshit attempt at going commercial or anything like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,better shorter more to the point and in my opinion the features on this mixtape are better
hiphopheads,not_removed,and that hook is fucking awesome
hiphopheads,not_removed,its on spotify for me in the uk its listed twice though lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,really dont know why these foreign links are allowed yeah there are like four users on this sub in australia seven if you count new zealand but most of the users here are american whats the point if a majority of the people here wont be able to listen to it yes i know it leaked but not everyone listens to leaks
hiphopheads,not_removed,affiliate
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah if they got uzi and carti on here i wish they wouldve gotten dolla too i think he wouldve been great on nastys world
hiphopheads,not_removed,it has tape in the name
hiphopheads,not_removed,every song bangs you can feel yams was really involved in this tape there was no bullshit attempt at going commercial or anything like that this has me excited im gonna give it a listen after hiac
hiphopheads,not_removed,can you post the spotify link please
hiphopheads,not_removed,because the guy who posted it lives in australia so he posts the australian link if its an american doing it then its kinda lame but whatever this isnt an american sub
hiphopheads,not_removed,now you know how it feels when people on reddit assumes everyone is american
hiphopheads,not_removed,usa usa usa fuck foreigners
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with you its really frustrating sometimes i once accidentally tapped switch store on mobile and it fucked my entire library up i was very angry to say the least
hiphopheads,not_removed,itll be available in hours and it will still be a top posti dont see an issue with it relax
hiphopheads,not_removed,either way i was hoping we would get a verse or something from him ashton matthews and retch
hiphopheads,not_removed,he was being sarcastic i believe
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean im not one of those people who assume everyone on reddit is american yall are taking this so seriously im just saying majority rules but like udowntothegwound pointed out it doesnt matter since itll be a top post in three hours anyway
hiphopheads,not_removed,not what i was saying but okay
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn that sucks on a similar note i have apple music but only to listen to songs i dont already have in my itunes i dont use it to download albums onto my phone because when it asked me to turn icloud music library on i did and it fucked up my entire library it changed all my album covers and song tags did this ever happen to anyone else i remember reading an article saying that icloud music library will delete tracks it doesnt recognize sometimes which is bad especially for artists that have their own music on their phone this one guy said he lost all the music hed made tho he shouldve had backup files on his computer this was when apple music first was introduced do you guys think this bug has been fixed
hiphopheads,not_removed,fair enough and stop telling everyone to relax
hiphopheads,not_removed,the lol lmao gives it away
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah man i think youre just kinda wrong here theyre australian and posted an australian link i dont think there should be a huge argument
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i think so theres a thing now where it asks if you want to keep the music on your device and you can say yes and itll add that music on your phone into the icloud music library and if you say no thats when it deletes and replaces the music that it finds i think before there mightve been no option and it just deleted everything and replaced it with what it found in the store and stuff also the icloud music library is actually really dope its why i can get all these mixtapes and stuff not on apple music or anything onto my phone cause itll sync up from my pc and still have it look and act exactly like a normal album you can mess around with the metadata and covers and everything too its pretty nice
hiphopheads,not_removed,relax
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah whatever its fine youre right there shouldnt be a huge argument i shouldnt have commented that cus its not something that bothers me so much but ive always seen people complain about that before in the past not a big deal tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not an argument but it is kinda weird having a fresh link up for like hours before it hits the us just because the thread will be empty af with no discussion during that time but therell be a ton of upvotes because not a lot of people can listen to it yet but technically it is fresh on one hand it seems like a karma grab but on the other it makes sense since that is where they live it was sorta that same thing with the fresh singles the other day where someone posted the singles like hours early because it was an australian link and all the thread was was a bunch of people linking mirrors because nobody could listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,i appreciate the response man i wasnt sure if someone would know so let me ask you another question my mac is constantly telling me im running out of storage i have about gb left none of my music is in the icloud music library my mac has gb of audio can i put all of that music in my icloud music library so that i could delete it from my mac to free up storage i dont really wanna shell out the money for an external hard drive if theres an easier solution
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont call me shirley
hiphopheads,not_removed,it depends i think but im not totally an expert it depends on how much of that music is like stuff that youve added from files that are separate from itunes so like i think if thats all third party music youre out of luck because the icloud still has to access those added files from your pc but if its music youve downloaded from just plain itunes or apple music then you should be able to delete the downloads but still have it added to your library so itll stay in there listed just not taking up space and anytime you want to listen to them itll just stream it for example i could delete gkmc from my pc and keep it in my library since its in their libraries by default but i couldnt delete faces from my pc without it being completely removed because its not on itunesapple music so it wont be able to be pulled from anywhere
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah im still a little confused all of my music is still in my downloads tab on my mac because if i were to delete those files itunes wouldnt even be able to play them ive tested that out before so as for your last paragraph you saying that i can delete albums because its in itunes anyway but not mixtapes because theyre not in itunes library to begin with so they wouldnt be able to be added to the icloud music library im still not sure about what to do
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah correct on your last paragraph anything in your downloads that is already in apple music youll be able to delete but youll still have to readd to your library but they wont take space on your pc but anything thats not in apple music youll have to keep in your downloads taking up space icloud music library is only for syncing your mac library with your iphone library so that theyre the same and will play those files it moves the local file into the icloud server which your phone accesses to download and play but i dont think once you move it into the icloud youre able to just delete the local file lemme try it
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha okay fuck i take that back i had acip rap downloaded onto my computer moved it into my itunes library and added it to my icloud library and then deleted nana in the actual local folder am able to play it on both my itunes player and my iphone despite the file being in my recycle bin i guess that is possible then to do what youre asking my itunes is being kinda fucky tho edit status update it is not being fucky anymore and is still successfully playing nana
hiphopheads,not_removed,this whole thing is confusing i have so much music downloaded hundreds of albums that i dont wanna lose by risking this icloud music library shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i feel its all good but basically like say you have a httpimgurcomaswaoq then you go into itunes and click i choose then itll have these little empty cloud like in this purple reign then i rightclick on the album and click add to icloud music library it syncs up and shows no clouds httpimgurcomareayf and then you can delete files from the local folder httpimgurcomaglwle and then i can still httpimgurcomanqjav and iphone without it taking up space in my local folder i hope that clears up what i mean but obviously its still sketch as fuck and i didnt take that same risk because i just switched from spotify to apple music and used an app to transfer my library over when i moved not moving from downloads on the hard drive
hiphopheads,not_removed,man i really appreciate you taking the time to do all that my process may be a little different but only slightly because i have a mac i do get what you did now though the only question i have left now is it safe then to turn on icloud music library without risk of my mixtapes and shit getting deleted as soon as i turn it on
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would say turn it on and if it asks whether you want to keep it or replace and delete which it should then you should go ahead and press keep and you should be good to go but if it doesnt give you that option i wouldnt risk it httpswwwgooglecomampampimorecomnoapplemusicnotdeletingtracksyourharddriveunlessyoutellitclientsafari heres a pretty in depth article on the whole process and differences between libraries if you wanna read before you try it
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,cj fly thee way eye see it
hiphopheads,not_removed,liked full moon the best drums are a bit loud darth jellyfish sounds out of key or something keep working on music and deliver with a little more enthusiasm good work man keep it up

hiphopheads,not_removed,a million times better than his recent work
hiphopheads,not_removed,did he have any tapes like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,eh not really his first tape purple thoughtz is kinda out there but i guess his second tape could come kinda close to thisreal uzi
hiphopheads,not_removed,not fresh
hiphopheads,not_removed,been out for ages now
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,howd this get downvoted smokepurrp is great
hiphopheads,not_removed,benefits of learning how to code being able to make viewbots right as youtube came out led to an easy opportunity like getting per music video
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised if this was actually true but the blog post redirects to a domain that isnt registered anymore for the source also i wish i had to blow on promoting my videos shiit
hiphopheads,not_removed,worked
hiphopheads,not_removed,baller
hiphopheads,not_removed,how much was paid though
hiphopheads,not_removed,promo is key to getting known the more money you spend on promo more people being reached
hiphopheads,not_removed,ya the thing is most rappers do this
hiphopheads,not_removed,though its hard to find a roy hubbs online and based on his supposed age youd think hed have some sort of social media
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah dont know why this would be a big deal if you have the money to promote promote word of mouth is in marketing i mean street dudes often shovel drug money to start getting noticed
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly money is always a huge factor in how things work no matter what people who consume the music might think it makes complete sense anyway so it shouldnt even be a surprise
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes you are
hiphopheads,not_removed,look alicia your husband is talented but a beautiful voice is something he doesnt doesnt have

hiphopheads,not_removed,going into this i really hope the mob other than rocky ferg and twelvyy can step up their game from their last project regardless i think thisll be a good tape
hiphopheads,not_removed,just an observation maybe put that on my set is a alla outtake rocky has been quoted as saying that he had a lot of grime artists in the studios to add to the vibes while recording for alla in london he also has specifically gotten along well with section boyz and skepta and skepta said they had songs together like last year i also think the song kinda sounds like it could maybe fit in the alla tracklist just a lil somethin i was thinkin lemme know what you guys think edit cozy tapes is hard top aoty for me already just because rocky is like a god to me favorites are put that on my set way hii bachelor runner and honestly every other song

hiphopheads,not_removed,this mixtape is amazing but im shocked there isnt a future feature on here yams fucking loved monster and i remember this being his dream so i was kinda hype for a late or early era future feature on here either way this might be my favorite tape of the year but i worship rocky plus the lesser known mob members stepped it up i usually hate asap ant because of bath salts but i think hes redeemed himself
hiphopheads,not_removed,no question that its a great release but why are lil yachty carti and uzi on this tape its called friends and features the mob and others yams knew and worked with but i havent heard anything about yams doing stuff with them are they out of place
hiphopheads,not_removed,rocky did his little experimenting with at long last asap and is getting back to making bangers love it
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is very good
hiphopheads,not_removed,jesus christ this album is golden
hiphopheads,not_removed,tyler had the best verse on the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,anyone else think nast is the future and a good direction for hip hop the potential he showed in trillmatic and the dead president joint was insane
hiphopheads,not_removed,love feeling vindicated for wearing gosha when rocky said this is gosha man i pay for pussy no sir
hiphopheads,not_removed,here in london im pissed af but this shit keeping me wake
hiphopheads,not_removed,so if this is volume friends edition does that mean theres supposed to be another project with no guest features on besides the mob

hiphopheads,not_removed,came into this not really knowing what to expect outside of the singles but this was good as fuck put that on my set is my favorite by a long shot but i fuck with this whole tape
hiphopheads,not_removed,so glad i held off on listening to most of these until today its so great to hear all fresh shit i only caved when telephone calls came out just to hear tylers part
hiphopheads,not_removed,wish the hook for telephone calls was better it doesnt do tylers verse justice
hiphopheads,not_removed,on money man rocky already slaying the flow
hiphopheads,not_removed,this two plus minute intro on yamborghini high is way too much why not split it out into another track at least
hiphopheads,not_removed,rocky is so so good but i find some of the beats not very enjoyable tbh put that on my set and money man are so fuckin especially lit tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,is nobody else tired of this generic trap sound i wish theyd at least try something a little different
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit nastys world is sickkkkkkk

hiphopheads,not_removed,i hear songs like this and just get flabbergasted at the fact that i constantly see people on this sub say ant is better than him like the fuck nast proves hes an emcee with shit like this i love it

hiphopheads,not_removed,them books will be there in a few hours bump cozy tapes
hiphopheads,not_removed,what you doing in reddit
hiphopheads,not_removed,same physics exam tomorrow cant decide between lord flacko or moments of inertia
hiphopheads,not_removed,do homework and listen like i have
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh just do your homework while you listen shit keeps me focused
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes crazy brazy bangs still fucking background noises got me paranoid af thinking that im sitting in the bus phonespealers are on without me noticing it
hiphopheads,not_removed,the other way around for me the only song ive heard is crazy brazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah havent listened to any singles except yamborghini high and crazy brazy and this tape soo good front to back
hiphopheads,not_removed,they completely bit the flow for crazy brazy from shits nearly identical
hiphopheads,not_removed,young nigga living went so hard im surprised theres not a lot of people talking about it
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeboyee ynl was produced by the boy dj smokey cant believe he got onto an asap tape check him out on soundcloudyoutube
hiphopheads,not_removed,the majoras mask sample at the beginning listening through chronologically and currently on this one my favorite so far easy
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to some dj smokey f you like the young nigga living beat one of my favorite producers and hes underrated
hiphopheads,not_removed,he can really do his thing when hes not on that ohhh yeaohhh ohhh yeah tokyo tokyo tip anymore him and the new wave overdo their adlibs to the point where it gets annoying but i digress hes nice imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,tokyo is crazy really think hes gonna blow up in music in the next year and he has started to already check out his most recent project thank you mr tokyo if you havent already
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think hes very talented i hope he drops an actual album soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe in when kanye goes prez
hiphopheads,not_removed,i realllllly hope so i enjoyed this so much maybe since there was features they called it friends so the next one wont have any features
hiphopheads,not_removed,what if enemies features everyone the mob members have beef with like spaceghostpurp and i think thats it honestly
hiphopheads,not_removed,might drop along with the next vlone drop no clue
hiphopheads,not_removed,all the songs go ham u might wanna stay away from this one b
hiphopheads,not_removed,im still vegetarian i dont think eating meat is a requirement to listen to this album
hiphopheads,not_removed,im vegan i liked it better up your vegetablegame and listen to it
hiphopheads,not_removed,seems to come to him so naturally too like im not saying he isnt working hard im just saying he makes it look easy
hiphopheads,not_removed,his flow has always reminded me of biggie
hiphopheads,not_removed,nast impressed me on this
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe the mob members besides rocky and ferg can release a solo mixtape or album or even an ep although twelvyy has had a few tracks this year and supposedly he has a mixtape coming out this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,my biggest take away from this fantastic album is that we really need a nast tape soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh bbk and aap collab would make me cum instantly
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn that is an interesting thought i totally agree with your logic it would fit very well in alla both sonically and featuring a london artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,i can confirm novelist was there
hiphopheads,not_removed,what song is that song sampling i cant put my finger on it edit lost chance
hiphopheads,not_removed,the music video for it is insanely dope too
hiphopheads,not_removed,flackooooooooo
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont fuck with wiz but he killed that verse
hiphopheads,not_removed,wish it was longer tbh favorite song on the tape for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,so many people were complaining like weve gotten like singles which means only new songs like fam just hold back till the release
hiphopheads,not_removed,his delivery on yamborghini high is so dope makes it so much fun to rap
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love that he adapts his flow for different styles of production where is the nast album is what im thinking after listening to this album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant stop thinking about how i wish this song was longer
hiphopheads,not_removed,i literally just searched the sub for the cozy tapes thread to upvote a comment like yours because i have had london town on repeat more than any other track ive listened to this year the bass the verses the hook soooo good
hiphopheads,not_removed,was wondering why theres nobody talking about carti his part is small but he kills it
hiphopheads,not_removed,or any of rockys songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,too bad the intro is min long
hiphopheads,not_removed,it definitely has that ny rap feel to it reminds me a bit of nasty nas
hiphopheads,not_removed,its on spotify too
hiphopheads,not_removed,aap twelvyy
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know it sounds like him
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was asap twelvyy he always sounds similar to schoolboy q whenever i hear him in a song
hiphopheads,not_removed,and
hiphopheads,not_removed,also he tyler doesnt count it but the golf media freestyle was dope too im out and cant link rn but you can youtube it
hiphopheads,not_removed,which kanye remix
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah dj smokey produced it and he always puts that shit in his beats he puts yoshi in his blunt
hiphopheads,not_removed,also skull kids laugh at the beginning tloz majoras mask
hiphopheads,not_removed,same sample
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a famous sample dr dre used it on the chronic
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpiimgurcomhczwaidpng
hiphopheads,not_removed,preach
hiphopheads,not_removed,its there now actually
hiphopheads,not_removed,its yams and rocky talkin about how they care more about being cozy as shit than lookin fresh
hiphopheads,not_removed,its just the intro to the album asap is new york so theyre just giving a little convo that youd hear in ny
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hate the skits i want to listen to music not some dude talking to his girl for two minutes
hiphopheads,not_removed,did it hit you once the album was over
hiphopheads,not_removed,and yoshi screaming
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was great
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought for a sec that it was a smokey beat cause of the sample kush aliens we out here
hiphopheads,not_removed,its crazy how good he sounds on a beat like that i would love to hear more of this stuff from him
hiphopheads,not_removed,when i saw rocky at day n night in socal he brought out uzi and other performers saying they are like family and proceeded to show off songs off this tape but it seemed they were hella cool
hiphopheads,not_removed,carti is signed to asap they the were first ones fucking with uzi too
hiphopheads,not_removed,amazing potential but hes more interested in being a fly nigga wearing clothes lol than making music sadly still dope dude though is crazy as well and his album thats coming is going to be sick which i imagine will have nast and a few others on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a fucking tune
hiphopheads,not_removed,young nigga living is produced by dj smokey i dont know the other production credits though
hiphopheads,not_removed,production is on point for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah its permission by ro james this is an interesting use of it it seems out of place when you read about it but it just works in practice
hiphopheads,not_removed,been used in other songs too including nobody by chief keef and kanye
hiphopheads,not_removed,young nigga living is my favorite so far so chill and a hard flow at the same time i havent heard a song like this before
hiphopheads,not_removed,wish cartis verse was longer
hiphopheads,not_removed,rocky did that and this sub murdered him
hiphopheads,not_removed,prob in min
hiphopheads,not_removed,its out
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpiimgurcomhczwaidpng
hiphopheads,not_removed,its there not in the new album section though
hiphopheads,not_removed,its out in australia
hiphopheads,not_removed,the baby is asap yams the guy who formed the asap mob he passed away jan this is a tribute project
hiphopheads,not_removed,both hard asf
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably no one most people here hated that song i love it though
hiphopheads,not_removed,it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,i liked rocky but i never really listened to asap mob im incredibly impressed with this the beats the bars everythings there and everyone does their part in featuring so good
hiphopheads,not_removed,wheres your mixtape what i thought
hiphopheads,not_removed,if anyone did it would be key
hiphopheads,not_removed,man relax ya double negatives
hiphopheads,not_removed,so you are disappointed
hiphopheads,not_removed,its whatever is sampled in lost by chance the rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,willie hutch brothers gonna work it out you might know it from dr dre ratatatat chance the rapper lost chief keef nobody
hiphopheads,not_removed,the end of rockys verse and when wiz comes in holy shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,gotta give credit to vice city for that flow
hiphopheads,not_removed,good thing rocky told tyler to get his flow up
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit when tyler came on that track fucking ridiculous didnt know he was on the track so it took me a second to realize it was him the taco jasper and lionel reference kinda gave it away
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol he dissed the month of january what other rapper has dissed a month of the year genius flow
hiphopheads,not_removed,that jeezy album is so good
hiphopheads,not_removed,been saying this since trillmatic came out ffs
hiphopheads,not_removed,it being an old nast verse honestly makes me hype to hear it i feel like nast has hit a little bit of a creative wall in his verse it seems like hes dedicating more time to other things like fashion
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes re used that verse a lot
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i wish we got some new stuff instead but ill live lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,he wasnt readyyy
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe people got tired of hate circlejerking yall some fucking queers grow a fucking beard since usually circlejerks tend to reverse after a while
hiphopheads,not_removed,rip big asap
hiphopheads,not_removed,what song is this i want to hear it but im too busy to listen to the whole album yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,you a cozy dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude idk what it is but ive had that stuck in my head since i heard it
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck school
hiphopheads,not_removed,yall better gangbang them books
hiphopheads,not_removed,how can you concentrate while listening to that tyler verse
hiphopheads,not_removed,just bombed a differential equation test yesterday life is too short to not rock out to hibachi lunch all day
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck calc i really hated it especially since it was an am class every single fucking day for a semester i got hope in you
hiphopheads,not_removed,its about the time in the semester where calc is just straight convergencedivergence tests right just gotta do a shitton of practice problems to get the hang of it man
hiphopheads,not_removed,currently trying to study for calc and listen to this album its going okay
hiphopheads,not_removed,howd it go b
hiphopheads,not_removed,i posted this hours ago im kinda finished
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeaaaah this was me on the bus mins ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,i only listened to telephone calls before
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh yamborghini high is top songs this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,ynls beat is so smooth as soon as i heard it i was in love with it
hiphopheads,not_removed,ferg made the track his own with some real shit bars out of nowhere
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive heard that song at least times today its fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea i knew i heard that tag before from yung simmie but couldnt remember the name thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think thats his beat tag so youll hear that a lot if you listen to him more
hiphopheads,not_removed,also the yoshi sample
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like literally every soundcloud trap producer uses this tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think a well timed skrt skrt makes it more hype like in i want
hiphopheads,not_removed,skrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
hiphopheads,not_removed,they all on that saint laurent all on my jeans yeah type flow it gets v repetitive
hiphopheads,not_removed,three things about madeintyo heres him rapping in heres a collection of madeintyo songs from between and tracks as jamaal davis httpssoundcloudcomjamaaldavis funny that in all his interviews he acts like he just started recording music last year fakery isnt he on this maxo kream track about in he isnt credited anywhere but it definitely sounds like him
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha man i thought everyone was listening to tokyo i listened to thank you mr tokyo and you are forgiven the night they each released
hiphopheads,not_removed,what a set up
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok thx
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao well playeed
hiphopheads,not_removed,not following
hiphopheads,not_removed,because yams
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol he set up my dude above you
hiphopheads,not_removed,when meat stops tasting so damn good ill go vegan
hiphopheads,not_removed,its that laid back flow
hiphopheads,not_removed,that biggie level effortless flow
hiphopheads,not_removed,nast has a big l kind of flow
hiphopheads,not_removed,those are some bomb ass fuckin leftovers
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not sampling that one that one is sampling another one thats mentioned up itt
hiphopheads,not_removed,and it is directed by flacko himself that man is a complete artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao youre hours old
hiphopheads,not_removed,still awful way to roll it out
hiphopheads,not_removed,nastys world he outshines the vet onyx if he drops a tape i hope its mostly these influenced beats that still feel modern
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know i hope some one uploads a version with out for future posting
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you have it on itunes you can cut it
hiphopheads,not_removed,with those real ass sounding sirens makin me look out the window n shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,check out if you havent
hiphopheads,not_removed,came to this thread to look for the spotify confirmation thanks edit spotify link
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,i honestly couldnt tell i didnt think it was cause the voice was off but like i said he rapped just like q would have on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,woah holy shit he goes in on fuck it was that song he did for his fashion show ever released officially
hiphopheads,not_removed,also what the fuck right now
hiphopheads,not_removed,do you know what other song that beat has been on by any chance
hiphopheads,not_removed,pour up that kirby roll up that yoshii
hiphopheads,not_removed,kind of ruins posting the fantastic song that is nastys world i had to let people know to skip the minute long intro on fb haha they could have separated that shit easily
hiphopheads,not_removed,the opening skit is the best thing about the tape yamsrocky is fuckin funny
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dunno motivation foreign was pretty funny fuck not them me you came to america so you definitely can get to london xd xd xd
hiphopheads,not_removed,no one can deny twelvys talent but also nastys presence is a big appeal to people i like that hes bringing that style back
hiphopheads,not_removed,kush aliens are invading earth
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know haha his tags are so easy to spot love his work
hiphopheads,not_removed,because rockys original sound was better
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay thanks i havent listened to anyone but rocky before but im liking this a lot
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont fucking claim to be a rapper but once i actually get what i need to record music it should he forthcominh
hiphopheads,not_removed,this logic makes zero sense
hiphopheads,not_removed,had to reread that comment like times lmao glad i wasnt alone
hiphopheads,not_removed,forreal that comment is not at all appropriate for monday morning
hiphopheads,not_removed,this made my day
hiphopheads,not_removed,i knew that his verse sounded familiar
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you i was wondering all day why it sounded so familiar
hiphopheads,not_removed,i fuckin know right last year they announced he was supposed to drop a tape last october then they never said anything after the announcement
hiphopheads,not_removed,trillmatic been in my rotation ever since
hiphopheads,not_removed,imo nasts thing is that he kills it on old sound beats he absolutely murders beats like
hiphopheads,not_removed,yamborghini high
hiphopheads,not_removed,i used to do it for the grams ayy
hiphopheads,not_removed,found odd future
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you still in high school you a headass
hiphopheads,not_removed,schools pretty cool man
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont be an idiot
hiphopheads,not_removed,truu
hiphopheads,not_removed,i actually like some of the stuff in calc but my teacher is so terrible that i basically have to teach myself everything
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck bro im studying algebra rn but im feeling cozzzzyyyy
hiphopheads,not_removed,that class is fucking ass calc and diff eqs are way easier
hiphopheads,not_removed,nope sequences and series
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk some of the questions were harder that anything in the hw but if he curves it i should be fine
hiphopheads,not_removed,mybad didnt realize the time
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha its not even that bus specific just if you are paranoid about your stuff playing in public while you are unaware of it dont play it at least for the first time
hiphopheads,not_removed,how the fuck did you guys not listen to yamborghini high that song came out right after yams death
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not saying the song was disappointing or bad because it wasnt but its not the soty that people were hyping it up to be its a dope ass song dont get me wrong but there are other songs on the tape id put above it personally i have heard the video is amazing tho but i havent seen it yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats super dope saw his name in one of the comments gonna check more of his stuff cause this was my favorite beat on the album reminds me of mac millers insomniac
hiphopheads,not_removed,huh i dont go listening to random trap producers on soundcloud so it was my first time hearing it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i want killed at my halloween party
hiphopheads,not_removed,funny that in all his interviews he acts like he just started recording music last year fakery what are you saying
hiphopheads,not_removed,tokyo had some dope bars and no thats not him on kreams track
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not him on trap mami
hiphopheads,not_removed,moving like rondo with the unselfishness
hiphopheads,not_removed,why did you mention you were vegetarian lol nothing wrong with that at all i just dont see how thats preventing you from listening to the tape
hiphopheads,not_removed,yam isnt meat tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i feel dumb as fuck for not catching that and making the joke myself lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,aw man youve never heard trillmatic feat method man gotta go give that a listen rn my g
hiphopheads,not_removed,nast is definitely the most underrated asap mob member just listen to trillmatic dude his flow is insane
hiphopheads,not_removed,his verse on nv is sick
hiphopheads,not_removed,lets hope it comes out asap mob has cancelled mixtapes and albums in the past
hiphopheads,not_removed,none of that really matters once the project drops awful rollouts are just something for people to complain about while waiting for the music unless the context is sales then sure its a relevant thing to bring up
hiphopheads,not_removed,the mbdtf method lmao when that album came out there were only like new songs to be heard
hiphopheads,not_removed,whatever though the musics here forever in a year you wont remember you heard many songs before release
hiphopheads,not_removed,your intro long you need to cut it
hiphopheads,not_removed,dope song check this one out if you havent heard it yet nast is one of the most underrated members of the mob
hiphopheads,not_removed,not that i know of
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know one of the other songs is the kanye remix
hiphopheads,not_removed,man im not a big fan of aap which is probably why i dont like the skits yambo high would be such a good opener but instead i gotta listen to two dudes i dont know talk about being cozy the music is dope as fuck which is what really matters obviously
hiphopheads,not_removed,positivesquad
hiphopheads,not_removed,cuz you stupid breh
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i still dont even know what hes saying
hiphopheads,not_removed,double negatives are like reddits new way of over emphasis like how we use the word literally now
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree man but he keeps doing shit like ladies hit squad
hiphopheads,not_removed,big if true
hiphopheads,not_removed,sound like some narcs
hiphopheads,not_removed,schools cool but its not for everyone
hiphopheads,not_removed,chainz is leaking
hiphopheads,not_removed,like a year after
hiphopheads,not_removed,because i didnt feel like listening to it when it came out and then i forgot it existed
hiphopheads,not_removed,no it was the next year
hiphopheads,not_removed,they played the fucking music vid in my gym popular as fuck now
hiphopheads,not_removed,video is meh imo i dont really give a fuck about music videos in general though
hiphopheads,not_removed,omg i was trying to think today after hearing that beat what is that mac miller song called that sounds like this guess they really are alike
hiphopheads,not_removed,im just saying if i hadnt heard the beat beforehand i would never have known it was dj smokey because the tag is used everywhere in that case it isnt really a tag
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude is disowning parts of his career
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay i wonder who that is
hiphopheads,not_removed,the word youre looking for is selflessness
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes vegetarian he cant listen yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,right fucking now
hiphopheads,not_removed,method mans flow on that song is something else man wew lad
hiphopheads,not_removed,era nasty
hiphopheads,not_removed,easy to make a few good songs if you make a song once every two years
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly songs were released within the last weeks
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn im dumb
hiphopheads,not_removed,as a person who over uses double negatives this wasnt easy not to read
hiphopheads,not_removed,he thought he would be disappointed
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao my brain hurts a bit now
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hate spam email
hiphopheads,not_removed,only a narc would call someone a narc
hiphopheads,not_removed,why are you being so narcoleptic right now
hiphopheads,not_removed,even the people that its not for still respect it if theyre smart
hiphopheads,not_removed,what the fuck man you realize theres algebra in college right dont be an asshole for no reason
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah yams passed january and the song was released january but it was the first mob song after his death and it came out on the one year anniversary of his passing idk i just thought the song was meaningful and it also bangs
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i thought that came out this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn i sort of looked at it as yams farewell song i wasnt about to skip that song
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude every rapper ever does this you think someone wants to stand behind the struggle middle school rap they did when they were teens i sure as hell wont acknowledge the shit ive done now if i ever get famous lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,look at you unselfishly helping my vocabulary
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh ok i didnt know
hiphopheads,not_removed,easy to make a few good songs if you make a song once every two years where are your hits at then
hiphopheads,not_removed,half the project was already out bruh they couldve alteast made it a little longer
hiphopheads,not_removed,you know i had it figured out but i still appreciate your translation lol that comment wrinkled my brain
hiphopheads,not_removed,being from a portuguese speaking country where double negatives are so common in the language i didnt even notice when i read it lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive already seen limitless
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao is this some hannibal or eric andre shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,acting so narcoleptic brotendo
hiphopheads,not_removed,deep
hiphopheads,not_removed,the moment when you realize that the first year of college is a review of the last years of high school at most colleges
hiphopheads,not_removed,he dont gotta hype his old music or plug it or anything but to act like he just started making music before uber everywhere is disingenuous
hiphopheads,not_removed,i am the bestest at vocabulastic shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,cmon you know thats a shit argument
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think the rollout was fine people just like to ruin shit for themselves
hiphopheads,not_removed,hannibal
hiphopheads,not_removed,well i mean to some extent he did probably has some old house video of him playing the piano when he was but he doesnt have to show it to everyone right i know thats an extreme and i get what youre saying tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,am i trippin or is this song just corny enough to be likeable
hiphopheads,not_removed,where is that beat sampled from it sounds so familiar
hiphopheads,not_removed,ludacris back with that red light district flow

hiphopheads,not_removed,literally listening to this right now for the first time loving it so far
hiphopheads,not_removed,endless is one of my favorite albums of all time a lot better than blonde in my personal opinion i listen to it at least like times a week

hiphopheads,not_removed,hip hop rap

hiphopheads,not_removed,hey all id love if you could give feedback this isnt mine its my friends creation httpssoundcloudcombluntcash
hiphopheads,not_removed,its like the same people buy his album every time
hiphopheads,not_removed,lyor bout to beat thuggers ass
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol i was in a travi scott thread saying that he was more popular than young thug and people were giving me shit lol sales s dont lie yall
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly the fact that commercial success has so far eluded young thug has to be a bit of a headscratcher for lyor and entertainment on paper he has all the elements of an artist poised to produce chart topping singles and albums interesting look and sense of style large social media following high profile features chances coloring bookkanyes life of pablo ushers hard ii love etc viral moments jeffery album cover modeling at yeezy season etc controversy beef with lil wayne and barter beef with future questions about sexuality etc constant media coverage dj akademiks vlad pitchfork complex etc catchy music within a very popular subgenre melodic trap output that is of consistent quality music videos which collectively have around a half a billion views major endorsementscosigns kanye west andre calvin klein puma elton john birdman etc dedicated cult following if you were to examine all these features in a vacuum a betting man would probably guess that this person was a highly successful artist who already had multiple platinum singles and number albums or at the very least could easily meet these benchmarks with a proper rollout and marketing yet despite all this thug has yet to produce even one top forty single as the lead artist now all this is not to say that thug is doing terribly as a commercial artist im pretty sure if you had access to the numbers you would find that all the for sale projects he has put out thus far are well in the black considering that has kept marketing costs quite low as far as i can tell in addition it appears that thug has no difficulty selling out medium to mediumlarge sized venues both across the united states and in western europe but nevertheless i would personally be hard pressed to think of an artist who has had as difficult a time as thug in finding commercial success at least roughly commensurate with their apparent massive general popularity and public profile
hiphopheads,not_removed,young thug going absolutely nowhere with his current method of releasing mixtape after mixtape after mixtape he has been selling first week for the past year wish he would just spend a good year or year and a half making a cohesive album i think that would help his popularity a lot more
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol and he wanted
hiphopheads,not_removed,did anyone listen to his wav interview with travi scott on there he said jefferey was his last project he wanted to release before becoming huge iirc i wonder how he plans on doing that kinda seemed like he stagnated over his last few releases maybe try to write catchier hooks with more mainstream appeal somehow its weird that hes planning on going big after his next album so what was this album for a goodbye to his underground fans
hiphopheads,not_removed,the tape is on datpiff for free why would anyone buy it
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats a bummer credit cards out booty goons
hiphopheads,not_removed,jeffery projected to sell with streams isnt that the usual for thugger
hiphopheads,not_removed,slime season moved so these numbers arent great
hiphopheads,not_removed,itt a bunch of white people shocked the streets aint on the same wave as hhh
hiphopheads,not_removed,ouch
hiphopheads,not_removed,well thats fucking garbage
hiphopheads,not_removed,i pull on ya bla and i pop at ur beh ya digggg
hiphopheads,not_removed,it sucks that a great original artist sells like shit when he makes great projects
hiphopheads,not_removed,it seems like thugger not playing by the rules is biting him in the ass a little
hiphopheads,not_removed,itt bad advice from white year olds on how rappers should market themselves
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hate to break it to you guys but thugga is really lacking widespread commercial appeal when jeffrey dropped some people acted like it was the second coming it might be a decent album but lets be honest thugga is not gonna do a million first week his songs appearance and persona are just too out there for most consumers most people wanna hear typical trapshit type bangers and thugga doesnt really fit that
hiphopheads,not_removed,its simple business nobody values his work and therefore people arent exchanging value money for it views on youtube and sound cloud dont translate to dollars
hiphopheads,not_removed,this sub is just the worst
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes put out albums in a year and a half its no surprise his sound is getting stale
hiphopheads,not_removed,hold up they marked de las album as a debut
hiphopheads,not_removed,he releases all his music on youtube the day its released how much does this affect sales if people can just go to youtube to listen why would they use a less convenient platform to get their music
hiphopheads,not_removed,how i feel like this is such a huge album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wish he would release cds or vinyls
hiphopheads,not_removed,umm all dat hype but where da gwop
hiphopheads,not_removed,what this nigga said about selling im glad to see that hes not as popular as this sub makes it seem to be
hiphopheads,not_removed,is it just me but i think thuggers music kinda sucks i like his hits but a lot of the rest just sucks
hiphopheads,not_removed,for all the love this dude gets why cant he move units thats it it seems like his buzz has been getting bigger and bigger and his numbers dont move this shit is baffling to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,good this kind of music sucks and barely falls under the category of hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,deserves mista ocean aubrey numbers honestly one of the top this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,too low numbers for such great work
hiphopheads,not_removed,lyon in shambles
hiphopheads,not_removed,why does it matter thug is creating the art he wants to the art that is in his head heart and its selling with streams okay house of balloons sold zero copies back in acid rap sold zero copies back in those two mixtapes are some of the greatest music ive heard in my life sales dont matter thug is still getting paid more than anyone in this thread hell be fine nobodys ever answered me in sales threads but do any one of you know how many copies your favorite albums have sold without looking it up when your listenin to mbdtf do you think this sounds like an album that moved first week im guessing the answer is no
hiphopheads,not_removed,lyon in shambles
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn was hoping for more but i guess thats about rightwonder if thugga cares or nah he has his own little merch and i know he toured a bit with scott but it seems like he doesnt really have any major revenue streams outside of features also wonder if lyor is pissed or doesnt care
hiphopheads,not_removed,part of the problem has to be the volume of music that comes out in leaked form im a huge young thug fan but when jeffery came out my instinct was to check free sources eventually i got it on google play but that is rarely the first place to look for young thugs music
hiphopheads,not_removed,this doesnt make sense to me the songs have millions of plays on youtube
hiphopheads,not_removed,where would i buy it itunes is there any other way
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly it comes down to singles
hiphopheads,not_removed,who cares what he sold thugga the goat ysl ok
hiphopheads,not_removed,half of that accounted from ktt
hiphopheads,not_removed,it becomes even more weird in perspective for example kevin gates is hardly talked about here and his album received minimal attention before and after release yet even he had sold in the us alone after the first week and rose to second in the charts iirc jeffery was hyped as hell yet is predicted this low i have no idea why he cant sell well i feel like most people i know were excited for this release he even had the added publicity of the weird cover art and people talking about him on twitter since one of his songs was called harambe edit also someone already summed up loads of reasons why thugger should be selling better
hiphopheads,not_removed,how common is it to have of your sales come from streaming thugs fans are probably just less likely to buy cds among other things
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats less than of the subscriber base here
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude thats all i could think about lyor has to be pissed as fuck right now
hiphopheads,not_removed,so i got a question lyor surely manages a lot of artists but why does it seem every time hes mentioned on here its always along side thug why does he do so much with him the whole release and snapchat does he do this w other artists too
hiphopheads,not_removed,i definitely didnt want to like young thug when i first heard him but he grew on me and now i really enjoy him i think the bottom line is that he didnt have a like fetty wap because he just isnt making that good radio hits and its not just coming together with promotion marketing around a few bankable huge singles hes killing guest verses and putting out good projects but i dont feel like many of his songs been of the type where you hear it and just know the shits going to get played out of it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like it just has to do with his fanbase thugger gets a lot of attention online from websites like and ktt and well us the thing is i bet the people who go on these sites regularly are the people are the least likely to be buying music whenever i talk to casual rap fans irl they usually hate young thug i cant even understand what hes saying or like one or two of his songs ironically i feel like these are the people who are most likely to be buying music or at least streaming it and if they dont like young thug they arent gonna be buying his shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,he is missing solo radio success features are cool but man you need your own track even lifestyle was styled under rich gang someone else mentioned kevin gates doing numbers but he has solo songs that have charted
hiphopheads,not_removed,all true but his music isnt that accessible even as far as hiphop goes his style is always in your face never background music you can just put on
hiphopheads,not_removed,i honestly wonder how long lyor and will continue to put this much hype and attention behind thug the bitter truth is that thug hasnt been as successful as they had hoped which is very unfortunate since jeffery was supposed to push thug over the top every attempt theyve tried to increase his sales has come up short maybe not with fans but with sales really sad since and jeffery is some of thugs best material
hiphopheads,not_removed,i put the blame squarely on they suck at promoting thugger and they seem to think that hell sell records solely through controversy or media coverage im not surprised that jeffery only sold the only promotion it got was through thugs ig account with a barelypromoted single and a release date that kept changing instead of getting sidetracked with minor digitalonly retail mixtapes every few months or so thugs team needs to focus on making his big debut album and actually market it like one
hiphopheads,not_removed,it is pretty simple the style and manner of thugs music is pretty niche young thugs primary distinguishing characteristic is his abnormal vocals and delivery historically artists with nonnormal deliveries have occupied a very niche part of american music very rarely to they reach the mainstream harsh vocals are common in genres like metal or emo but the metal or emo bands that most break into the mainstream top historically have been ones that havent used harsh or screamed vocals or havent used them nearly as much as their contemporaries even someone as famous as bob dylan who has a bit of an odduntraditional voice doesnt actually sell as well as you would think even highly acclaimed records like highway revisited werent exactly huge sales wise it isnt cause he isnt marketed or is bad at promotion or he doesnt have cosigns the fact is his vocal delivery ensures he will forever be niche
hiphopheads,not_removed,hitunes otw bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,jeffery could definitely had been a great tropical reggae hip hop sounding album if he had left a few tracks out and worked on getting some more in that match the sound of wyclef kanye etc that really would have set him apart from the trap sound thats everywhere right now and made his music even more unique i think he shouldve done that give an actual release date hes probably not big enough to be doing these random overnight drops yet thats the type of thing beyonce is big enough for but smaller artists should stick to the formula to get to the place where they can do that and have it be successful shouldve made it an album promoted it like an album gave a solid nopushbacks release date have his people market it as an album dont charge people money for a mixtape i dont think that helped at all also if youre going insist on charging money for a mixtape dont put every single track and a full mixtape stream up on your official youtube channel that made no sense to me i didnt buy it because besides not being too familiar with thugga i didnt have to it was up everywhere for free the release day kw loves young thug so much he bought him a pair of yeezys off of freaking ebay yet when jeffery came out not even a peep out of kanyes twitter i think kanye played a big role in frank oceans album getting so much love with that string of tweets about it
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont think it has to do with rollout or market saturation he still hasnt had a crossover hit that would prompt a bigger response from the general public i guess his camp doesnt care much for it but if he wants bigger numbers he either needs a commercial feature or a big hit
hiphopheads,not_removed,you didnt think jeffery was cohesive
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know what you guys even mean by cohesive but if you mean something like blonde or tpab thats the last thing i wanna hear from him what makes thug special is his spontaneity and rawness theres a decent amount of artists out there who make cohesive music few that make music like thug have him go the curreny route or full experimental thats my selfish hope
hiphopheads,not_removed,agreed theres always this discussion of relevancy or legacy many years down the road about the guys doing their thing rn and people say yeah thug and yachty are gonna be remembered for decades but weve consistently seen the only people that are remembered are remembered for albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree as much as i love thug i dont ever like every song on one of his mixtapes i pick and choose and probably listen to songs over and over the exception being barter i really hope hytunes can top
hiphopheads,not_removed,doesnt first week multiplied by three forsale projects over the last year and a half add up to a decent amount of sales the average rap artist puts out an album every two years at most so thugger will be moving as many cds as an average rapper who regularly sells first week at this rate and as far as popularity it seems like everyone knows who young thug is it really seems like hes doing ok
hiphopheads,not_removed,but but hes jeffery now his style is so new and different
hiphopheads,not_removed,not saying that its good but if hes selling three times a year it aint too bad especially if his streaming numbers are high and he usually gets a decent amount of streams just from the first week and continuing on as some of the individual songs start to pop off and get mass plays his popularity isnt too bad for what he is but he could definitely use some time off with a really good single or two to build some hype before his next release
hiphopheads,not_removed,if thug spent a year working on an album and then gave me jeffery id be psyched thats the weird part i think i agree that he needs to space out his projects more to build hype but i think jeffery was a really fucking good album if views was a then jeffery is a solid maybe to me if the narrative were hey i spent months working on and perfecting this album instead of hey heres my third album this year brb gotta go work on the fourth i think he would certainly be selling more because then its the next big thing from young thug instead of just the next thing from young thug but at least with jeffery and i think the quality is there both of those will probably crack my top albums at the end of the year at this point i think its more about peoples perception of him
hiphopheads,not_removed,he fucking played himself lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,they were crazy if they thought thug was going to reach lol as much as i love jeffery he hasnt had a project that went over slime season sold around iirc
hiphopheads,not_removed,he only said he would change his rapname into jeffery if it sold
hiphopheads,not_removed,going the pop music route is what i think he means
hiphopheads,not_removed,goodbye to the underground the place that im from
hiphopheads,not_removed,just bought it to help out i have apple music but fuck it im supporting him
hiphopheads,not_removed,was with streams though pure album sales were like so its similar
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre right idk anyone else besides white music heads who like thugger its just lil b all over again
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean its white people and middle class black people that listen to him its sorta sad because his music is honestly really catchy and funny but i think people from the hood mostly write home off as a lil wayneodb rip off while white people hype him up way too much
hiphopheads,not_removed,no thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not sure it has much to do with album quality though and jeffery will both almost certainly be in my top ten albums of the year i think he is making his best work right now it might just be his brand of music just isnt mainstream popular
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive enjoyed every slime season better than rodeo
hiphopheads,not_removed,he isnt capable of making a good song so how will he do that
hiphopheads,not_removed,yikes
hiphopheads,not_removed,i pull up on u and i buck at ya kii ya digggg
hiphopheads,not_removed,honest question here what makes young thug so original for me he sounds a lot like every other mumble rapper im not trying to diss thug its just that ive never gotten in to his music
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think this has been a turning point in his popularity in spite of the sales and disagree with the going nowhere shit people are saying in here
hiphopheads,not_removed,great original artist lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,did you buy it though
hiphopheads,not_removed,he cant even sell albums normally and you want him to sell vinyls
hiphopheads,not_removed,barter had a vinyl
hiphopheads,not_removed,it doesnt suck to me you gotta listen to barter and his leaked songs last year about songs leaked i think he had better songs that leaked than he had on im up jeffery hes just really bad at picking out the music to put on his mixtapes
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have a few possible reasons hes becoming too big of a meme and people dont even pay attention to him for the music he has his music available on datpiff and other mixtape sites after all this is a mixtape hes putting out too much im not saying it isnt quality but the sound will get worn out his target audience isnt exactly the buy albums type hhh doesnt make him seem bigger than he is hes huge i promise you over of my school knows who he is he just cant get his music to push
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol you downvoting me for having desire that he must have greater numbers fake fans
hiphopheads,not_removed,thugger fans will always get his shit for free cause they broke af
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love kevin gates music but i like to pretend that all of his social media doesnt exist
hiphopheads,not_removed,tbf pretty much everyone in louisiana is a gates stan
hiphopheads,not_removed,hhh isnt the real world you wouldnt know that geazy is one of the hottest rappers in the game if you got all your info from here thats fine of course because an internet forum neednt mirror the real world
hiphopheads,not_removed,not as many people like thuggers music as you think just because your friends do doesnt mean he is going to sell well lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,he need a dj mustard beat
hiphopheads,not_removed,its usually said that this place isnt the best barometer for whats hot generally
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like most people i know were excited for this release i know nobody who was exited about this release boom
hiphopheads,not_removed,kevin gates has a number of radio songs though thug has not had any in a long while at least solo gates is really gritty but he can make a melody well i think the average rap fan honestly likes gates a lot more than thugga i love both but really i would not have expected gates to sell as much i wouldve thought thug would sell at least
hiphopheads,not_removed,lets all address the elephant in the room then young thug flopped with all that hype he managed to sell only
hiphopheads,not_removed,because all the hype is fake lyor is running yall like bitches
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was absolutely shocked when i saw those kevin gates numbers his ass is pretty irrelevant here for real yet i brought him up to my boys that go to school at like uga bama ole miss and theyre like yeah wtf u not bumpin kg hes everywhere man
hiphopheads,not_removed,kevin gates gets talked about on other social media platforms though
hiphopheads,not_removed,this site is far from representative of the general hip hop community to be honest
hiphopheads,not_removed,to be honest i only listen to thugger as some kind of novelty when im absolutely bored of everything else i just put him on for like minutes to have fun i would never buy his album same with the people i know
hiphopheads,not_removed,kevin gates is quite big outside of this sub he was one of the top rappers in
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought kevin gates had his album on preorder for like a year
hiphopheads,not_removed,jeffery was only hyped because you saw it hyped on an internet forum i have never met anyone over the age of that fucks with thugger his demographic is kids who obsess over their js and that ugly fucking haircut that looks like a carrot
hiphopheads,not_removed,no he doesnt i think lyor sees in thug a huge artist that for whatever reason is not pushing numbers like he should be see this great writeup by i think lyor bought out thugs contract with somebody else so he wants to make extra sure it was worth it but i could be wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes more handson with thugger the other artists on ent are either huge like fetty wap and migos or still starting out thug is the obvious next artist to blowbut for some reason lyor just cant get this guy to blow up lol this is the man that made half of def jam into household names
hiphopheads,not_removed,im curious about this as well obviously lyor is gonna hype well whatever you call lyors hype thugger but it seems like they have a very personal relationship whenever i see them in interviews
hiphopheads,not_removed,lyors been a fairly famous industry figure for a while started by working with run dmc for example but thug is probably the person hes focused on the most and has the most influence on plus given thugs strange online presence lyor speaks for him more often than he would with a typical client i imagine i think the reason lyor seems to be so much involved with thugger more than his other artists is because he wants to make him a huge super star but thug is such a weird dude it takes a ton of work to get him to go along with it
hiphopheads,not_removed,travis scott takes more time with his projects and i think has more quality control
hiphopheads,not_removed,ya i would agree the issue though is that i dont think anyone has really cracked the formula of what makes a certain rap song a massive radio smash hit when i heard check by young thug i thought for sure that it was going to be a huge radio hit with its smooth instrumental and simple catchy refrain got me a check i gotta check but it barely made an impact by comparison bobby shmurda an individual with literally no previous presence in the music industry puts out an aggressive street rap song with no hook over a recycled fairly basic instrumental not to mention that the original song title hot nigga was certainly not radio friendly and it happens to skyrocket to number on billboard and go platinum in the span of a few short months this isnt to say that bobbys success is undeserved or anything i just think it is illustrative of the fact that it is damn near impossible to intentionally formulate a radio hit in rap with any kind of consistency anymore unless you are already a commercially dominant artist some songs just have an x factor that resonates you cant really force it all you can do is put out as much as possible and be prepared to ride the wave when something sticks
hiphopheads,not_removed,tbh i think pick up the phone despite being out for a while at this point might blow up soon and be thugs trap queen at least i hope so
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dunno i bet people who frequent pitchfork are more likely to buy music than most i think most people over just get by with an album here and there
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly this
hiphopheads,not_removed,bestfriend tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,but arent they more or less spending no money on marketing i assume that is both a huge part of the budget of your usual album and also a huge part of why thug hasnt found mainstream success im not sure he is the type of artist to ever find it but the you arent popular in the mainstream so we arent going to devote advertising dollars to you thing feels a bit like a i guess thug just needs that hit single to make him worth marketing i do think his pace of churning music out very quickly instead of working on one album for a long time is probably a big part of it too though
hiphopheads,not_removed,this sounds like it could be true but im not really sure how true it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,not releasing an album doesnt mean doing nothing though drake usually has a constant stream of non album singles leading up to his albums to build buzz kendrick does quite a few features although not so much this year you dont need to release an entire solo album every months to be releasing music
hiphopheads,not_removed,can you imagine if he actually worked on an album for a full year tho masterpiece
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude future and thug need volume because they are flash in the pan artists the guys who did very similar music before them mostly with a few exceptions burnt out very quickly thats just the nature of the music they make think about how much rich homie quan has been forgotten for example where is roscoe dash kirko bangz hell waka flocka even fell off in terms of success thug has a fanbase theyll just forget him really quickly if he takes an extended period off hell even if he doesnt edit i will say at this point i think future has made it to the point that hes like gucci and his popularity will continue for some time
hiphopheads,not_removed,so so soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,kanye has proven time and time again he cant focus on promoting an artist besides himself
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think kanye played a big role in frank oceans album getting so much love with that string of tweets about it lmao ignoring the fact people had been waiting or years for the album and its amazing quality thanks ye
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats what his comments implying
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think it is i think barter was to a certain extent but i really think thugger needs to release a real album with real subject matter and real pacing i love thug and ive listened to barter probably close to times now but he is not fulfilling his potential rn in my personal opinion i did think jeffey had great songs but it wasnt a great epmixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh it is not cohesive at all the fucking track titles alone are confusing a song called wyclef jean that doesnt have wyclef jean in it and a track called kanye west that has wyclef jean in it i mean even small shit like that makes the masses go huh moving on to the actual album content this shit is all over the place we all know and appreciate that thug can do many different things but do they all have to be showcased on the same album thats just comes off as confusion imo one track hes got his cookie monster voice going the next couple tracks have a reggae vibe to them then theres a few tracks that sound somewhat like classic thugger is anyone else here questioning whether or not lyor is actually doing thug any good im telling yall the key to getting thug to blow up are collabs like the jamie xx track throw him on a track with edward sharpe the magnetic zeros get him to do shit with gorillaz hell kill it on any and all of that and people will turn their heads putting out tapes in half a year is awesome for us stans but the dude is just running in sand at this point and we dont want him to fall in a situation where the keys are on the other side of the door hes gotta get in with the big collabs now before whatever fame he has dwindles down jeffery was not the project he needed imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,i personally do not think its cohesive
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would love him to go full experimental my problem with young thug is that hes a song artist hes got a lot of great songs that i play a lot but as someone who mostly listens to music in album format i have very little desire to play his full projects i wish he would release something that cuts out the filler that feels like a special project that just showcases more than his potential
hiphopheads,not_removed,if he was an independent artist the sales would be great but hes not he really needs to start living within his means aesop rock sells about as much as him and has been touring for years but im sure hes not living in a mansion and shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,doesnt first week multiplied by three forsale projects over the last year and a half add up to a decent amount of sales technically yeah but it also implies that its essentially the same people buying each of his projects he isnt actually expanding despite putting in lots of work to do just that look at the the comment comparing a clear increase in sales after each project young thug himself wanted a significantly higher amount of sales maybe not as many people know who he is as we think this sub is an echo chamber afterall if he was as popular as the internet would have you believe jeffery would easily have sold around
hiphopheads,not_removed,its better to have more sales on fewer projects than the other way around every project you do in a year increases your overhead cost eats into profits etc think about it like this if you had albums that each sold you had to pay people to help you make those albums times but if you had one album that sold youd make more profit cause you only had to pay people to help you make an album once
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was with streams it actually sold about the same as this one his numbers actually havent really changed much at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,haight
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i doubt you could gild every twice
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude dont waste your money hes just gonna spend it on buying boogers for his apple watch
hiphopheads,not_removed,hhh puts the cult in cult following
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats like a decrease in sales
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes right tho he would take his time with his music
hiphopheads,not_removed,edgy
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow insightful and necessary
hiphopheads,not_removed,honest question here who does he sound like
hiphopheads,not_removed,honest question who are these other mumble rappers that sound like young thug
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think its his flows and delivery that he gets praise for but hes not doing anything mystikal didnt do years ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,the way he whinesings is pretty unique i also find hell change up the flow mid verse more times than others like future not saying futures flow is bad just hell find a rhythm and stick with it where young thug is a bit more sporadic his melodies are also a lot more intricate than similar mumble rappers
hiphopheads,not_removed,apple musictm
hiphopheads,not_removed,he doesnt say it would increase thuggers sales but that he would prefer to buy it on that medium i admittedly only purchase vinyls and not digital music and would definitely buy the slime seasonsbarter on vinyl if it were available
hiphopheads,not_removed,it did indeed although it was a pretty limited number the red looks so smooth though glad i was able to grab one
hiphopheads,not_removed,gucci was a meme or became a meme and it didnt stop him from moving units when he got out of jail gucci always put out mix tapes left and right bro and nobody ever got tired of him he is also not the only one relaxing mixtaped on datpiff most rappers release it on there i know young thug is huge but he cant move units i think his songs like substance and cohesiveness and maybe he should work on that
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree putting out too much devalues the product
hiphopheads,not_removed,his issue is he doesnt have very many transcendent songs just very solid songs that all sorts bleed together because theyre of similar quality he needs that undeniably good single to define who he is as an artist the problem is that those things take time to write and refine and thug just mostly freestyles or raps what hes been keeping in his head like hes never gonna release a song as tightly structured as trap queen and honestly thats the type of song hed need to blow his spot up and make people actually want to buy his music right now hes just releasing mindless crap that is just catchy but not memorable he needs something that will truly stick in the public consciousness
hiphopheads,not_removed,thugger travis scott fans all broke ass student
hiphopheads,not_removed,tbh now that i think about it he isnt even the best example kevin gates does get loads of publicity for all the weird shit hes done hes not talked about that much on here but on social media he gets publicity regardless but theres probably other rappers i cant think of right now that get less publicity than thugger seemingly get less buzz in real life then sell better anyway thuggers done all the right things to be selling over but seems to fail after every project apparently he wanted to sell this time lol maybe its simply because he releases music too often also unrelated but youre missing out if you completely ignore gates instagram he occasionally teases really dope songs there although the downside is you end up thinking theyll be released on his next project smh ive been waiting for some of them for around years
hiphopheads,not_removed,for real dont listen to interviews either the man just talks out his ass high off lean or percs or idk how he is thirty and says so much dumb shit is puzzling that music is undeniably good tho so ill skip the interviews and social media and plan to never hang out with the dude unless i want to smoke dog penis
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea i heard hes way bigger down south
hiphopheads,not_removed,my friends who hate rap like gates its so weird to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,not as many people like thuggers music as you think thats my point though with how highly i see all his stuff upvoted here and how much hes talked about on twitter and instagram ect it led me to believe that a lot of people listen to him thats why i was so surprised to see what hes projected to sell then rappers who i hardly ever hear about casually put up similar to greater numbers
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with you
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly kevin gates can make some of easiest to listen songs rn
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah they fuck with him heavy in the south
hiphopheads,not_removed,he is the most played artist on the radio in louisiana so far this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,substance is what is lacking in most of young thugs songs they are great party tracks but he never says anything worthwhile its all party tracks shit is everywhere with him his mixtaped or albums are never cohesive nothing make sense he had a song called fuck cancer dedicated to lil boosie dont get me wrong the song bumps he said fuck cancer shout out to boosie and then rambled on about some random shit the rest of the song like really fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,im and most of my friends listen to young thug
hiphopheads,not_removed,im
hiphopheads,not_removed,ur cutting ppl pretty deep here lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre wrong i hate js
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think he should have released pop starkanye west as a single or even swizz beats as a good catchy song for the radio to play like there was some hype behind the album but i dont think a strange album cover is that big of a reason for people to buy the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably cause loads of people just write him off as autotune muble garbage hard to push it to a large audience
hiphopheads,not_removed,he treats thugger like a special needs student
hiphopheads,not_removed,thug has the potiential to be a star but releasing mixtape after mixtape isnt going to do it i think he should embrace his pop side with songs like kanye west and webbie and go full pop route make pop songs like fetty wap
hiphopheads,not_removed,the x factor in hot nigga was the about a week ago line which went viral on vine not to mention the shmoney dance
hiphopheads,not_removed,when i heard check by young thug i thought for sure that it was going to be a huge radio hit with its smooth instrumental and simple catchy refrain got me a check i gotta check but it barely made an impact god this read like a highschool sophmores essay
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk dawg people who go on pitchfork are probably youngish and also probably consume a lot of music people who are young probably dont have the money to spend willynilly on albums and people who consume a lot of music are even less likely to buy music otherwise theyd go broke from just buying music all the time
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think that touches two phones or really really
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao definitely an absolutely maybe situation
hiphopheads,not_removed,kendrick does not do nearly as many features as most other artists a kendrick feature is actually pretty rare and j cole has released a total of like songs features since fhd came out almost full years ago drake does consistently release music though but if he chose to not release that many songs for like years then drop an album he would still sell a shit ton because of his fanbase
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats drake though he has a pretty diverse fanbase teenagers hipsters soccer moms thuggers fans are mainly teenagers who are as fickle as it gets
hiphopheads,not_removed,my beautiful dark slime fantasy
hiphopheads,not_removed,barter
hiphopheads,not_removed,slimematic
hiphopheads,not_removed,aaaand were back to the memes
hiphopheads,not_removed,if the dude could string together a decent bar maybe lmao whoever downvoted i challenge to link a good thugger bar
hiphopheads,not_removed,waka didnt really fall off he just found his niche look at his numbers theyre stable
hiphopheads,not_removed,you cannot compare future and young thug to roscoe dash and kirko bangz
hiphopheads,not_removed,get him to do shit with gorillaz oh man that would be wild
hiphopheads,not_removed,and jeffery had no filler in the sense that the general consensus seems to be that there are no mediocre or lazy songs and they hold up all the way through but they still feel like just collections of tracks the biggest reason to me why young thug couldnt make a mbdtf or a gkmc at this point seems to be that none of his songs are about anything while his melodies are incredible his songwriting could use a little work most of his tracks just feel like showcases of crazy deliveries over production that makes them sound beautiful rather than songs created with a clear intent designed to deliver a specific artistic message there are definitely a few shining exceptions though like never made love
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah it seems like hes gotta a lot of different types of music throughout his discog but the individual projects sound more or less the same if that makes any sense
hiphopheads,not_removed,believe it or not i also talk to people in real life everyone i talk to knows who young thug is but idk
hiphopheads,not_removed,its cultlike to support an artist you like
hiphopheads,not_removed,i meant theyre moving the same total number just that this time he got way less pure sales gonna depend on the final numbers though
hiphopheads,not_removed,the flair makes it better lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a huge thugger fan but he clearly sounds like wayne lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,his idol lil wayne except he puts more emphasis on melody instead of bars and rapping ability
hiphopheads,not_removed,mainly deigner lil uzi and future but i think the reason they so a like is that i dont listen to their type of music much so it blends in kind of like how to some people all hip hop sounds the same even though theres pretty huge differences
hiphopheads,not_removed,didnt realize mystikal was wore a dress on his album cover
hiphopheads,not_removed,today on the radio i heard pick up the phone no limit and that dj snake jeremih x thug x swiss beats on a mainstream r b hip hop station here in new zealand normally apart from the really mainstream stuff drakerihannaetc shit takes ages to get to us i really think hes on the cusp of mainstream success
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea im always down to support the artist but i dont and wont buy digital albums just feels like a waste of money if there are cds ill pick them up in an instant i got hiphop cds crudley stacked around my room
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw barter on vinyl at urban outfitters
hiphopheads,not_removed,so did i hope he releases jeffery on vinyl in purle they would look so sweet together on my wall
hiphopheads,not_removed,he moved units because of the out of jail hype and it wasnt that much gucci was already established as a legend too wait for young thug to drop an actual album and hell move much more
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol well travis fans actually buy his music
hiphopheads,not_removed,tory lanez i have no idea how he sold as much as he did i thought he was gonna do like
hiphopheads,not_removed,also thug oversaturates his releases so he sells less
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe its simply because he releases music too often i think this is it if anything thug has released a bunch of average tapes before so even though he is a bigger artist a lot of people who arent into thug like that wont be interested in checking out the new things theyll just wait for the singles to come out and bang them instead
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah im from alabama and every college party i ever go to some redneck kid grabs the aux and im thinking ah fuck i hate country nope they play gates
hiphopheads,not_removed,well hhh is an echo chamber when it comes to music if you get all your opinions and news from here youd think that run the jewels would be going platinum with every cd they release plus despite what this subs think young thug is popular for all the wrong reasons hes usually brought up for a negative reason on social media
hiphopheads,not_removed,rap blog people really love thugga but i dont think he quite has a wider audience outside of weird traprap blogs people have a big stigma against him still for the pseudogay shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know this sub loves to downvote anyone who says this but most people i chill with dont even understand anything hes saying
hiphopheads,not_removed,some of my favorite thug is on those rich gang tapes where he actually has a few personal bars here and there never made love is good
hiphopheads,not_removed,his songwriting does need work
hiphopheads,not_removed,and what is a decent portion exactly
hiphopheads,not_removed,anecdotal shit doesnt matter when the artist sold lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol straight shooter man the numbers are telling
hiphopheads,not_removed,if that were true future would be selling too
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats his fault
hiphopheads,not_removed,but future and fetty wap are successful
hiphopheads,not_removed,so youre saying yung thug is like
hiphopheads,not_removed,no he doesnt if you add him on snap youll see that he really believes in thugger and his music he believes in him way too much tbh lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,kanye west and webbie are dope but i really dont want that idk im conflicted because i want thug to be a star too
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck please dont remind me of that dark time
hiphopheads,not_removed,buddy i was trying to convey a simple point in a casual conversation on an internet forum in under a minute im not sure what is so offensive about the sentence i wrote that it compelled you to critique it in this manner but if you are looking for a more substantive sophisticated discussion on music you should probably sign off of hiphopheads and start reading world as will and representation by schopenhauer or the birth of tragedy by nietzsche
hiphopheads,not_removed,sophomore
hiphopheads,not_removed,how
hiphopheads,not_removed,you know what i think youre right i just looked it up and the people who buy the most music are over the age of and theyre not buying newer music im in my and im the only person i know who still pays for music everyone else is just content with pandora or listening to their cds from high school i guess things have changed a lot since i was a kid and teenagers spent a large chunk of their income on albums and concerts
hiphopheads,not_removed,they have similar amount of views on youtube though
hiphopheads,not_removed,kendrick does not do nearly as many features as most other artists a kendrick feature is actually pretty rare he still releases a good amount of music in non album years in he had features on official singles and guest verses on non singles like i said he hasnt done nearly as much this year but he dropped basically an entire album of throwaways from other albums obviously he cant just take years off like j cole but i think if his label focused on getting him quality features and singles he would do better than just releasing a full album every months
hiphopheads,not_removed,kendrick doesnt do many features but the ones he does are usually pretty big though he had a feature on songs for taylor swift and beyonce ffs add to that a tale of citiez from j cole although that wasnt exactly a feature no more parties holy key and a bunch of features on compton which have been all with huge artists that sell well and are popular between the people that actually buy music and of course untitled unmastered his output since tpab might not have been that big as far as quantity goes but output liek this would certainly help most artists
hiphopheads,not_removed,kendrick does tons of features
hiphopheads,not_removed,what a time to be a slime
hiphopheads,not_removed,the life of thugger jeffrey
hiphopheads,not_removed,the only album i really like from yt and i play it everytime front to back when i workout all the others are very average for me personally and this new one i only liked song
hiphopheads,not_removed,id link a line youd nitpick it and say something like youre only proving my point id get angry and argue about our subjective experiences of music then you or someone would say i care too much lets skip that thug does have good lines unless youre trying to compare him to some really ridiculous lyricists i clearly think hes a good artist you clearly dont dont act like its an objective thing by asking for examples because your mind is obviously made up
hiphopheads,not_removed,personally both those projects have a few great tracks but then some boring and forgettable ones
hiphopheads,not_removed,are you saying ill pull up and bust your mama ill pull up and bust your brother ill aim at your fuckin family ill aim at your whole clique ill aim at your mothafuckin mama ill aim at your fuckin dad ill aim at your daughter son nigga doesnt have an artistic message to it
hiphopheads,not_removed,but do they like him enough to buy his albums im sure most if not all of my good friends know who he is but i can only think of one that would probably pay for one of his releases
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just realized youre tridentgum i feel starstruck as a thug stan
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk how that is even a question he sounds like lil wayne with a little more singing this sub used to clown thugger for shounding like wayne its amazing how they switched up
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep
hiphopheads,not_removed,then why did jeffery sell less than barter first week
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit you are right call me a bad fan
hiphopheads,not_removed,barter
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you can cater to the womenz you get bank see bryson tiller g eazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,hit songs and lots of touring
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was a pretty good album plus that say it joint was pretty big last year and that luv joint is everywhere i still think young thug has a bigger buzz then him and has more hits but dont know why that buzz doesnt translate to sells its quite the enigma
hiphopheads,not_removed,if hed stop releasing instrumental albums hed probably sell better
hiphopheads,not_removed,nothing average since before rich gang
hiphopheads,not_removed,something something killer mike would be platinum
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah youre right although plus despite what this subs think young thug is popular for all the wrong reasons hes usually brought up for a negative reason on social media that can be directly applied to gates tbh i dont think ive ever seen him trending for a good reason hes proof that any publicity can be good publicity unless youre tyga but i dont even like his music so i wont get into that thats why i thought thugger would do the same thing the only difference is gates legitimately seems crazy at times sometimes isnt even aware that some of the things he saysdoes are weird or wrong thugger seems to force it a bit but in his defense i dont recall anything legitimately bad hes done only weird
hiphopheads,not_removed,outside of certain rap circles yt is seen mostly as a meme
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean for the average rap fan who isnt a big yt person they go on itunes and see thugger in a samurai dress on the cover and a lot of people wont even listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe but after typing out that comment i realized the only ones were excited were the ones i told to get excited so this wasnt a good example
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was responding to anecdotal shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,your just going to disregard the other in streaming
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not saying i judge him like that but i know of plenty of people jamming to fetty and future then calling thugga out on the autotune
hiphopheads,not_removed,hot nigga still fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,hell im and im the only person i know who still pays for music haha i totally get whatcha mean
hiphopheads,not_removed,best friend didnt get anywhere close to the amount of radio play that phones did
hiphopheads,not_removed,only on youtube phones went on the charts and both songs have way more plays on spotify than bestfriend
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think hes bad tho his melodies are amazing the way he says words is creative as fuck he does not have bars tho and i find it hard to see how he could put together a masterpiece album without at least a couple of those its honestly what holds him back
hiphopheads,not_removed,you really dont see the difference between roscoe dash and future and thug you need someone to explain to you the difference between these acts
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk theres a few songs on both i dont care for but i think it comes down to more of a personal preference ive seen all the tracks get praise around here there arent any songs which obviously should have been either discarded or further developed which wasnt the case with his earlier work
hiphopheads,not_removed,downvotes from the booty brigade i see smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,very original
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont im your typical dumbass redditor p
hiphopheads,not_removed,because sales figures isnt the only measurement of popularitysuccess now the only music that sells big time is stuff that appeals to the type of people who still buy music he hasnt captured that market and maybe never will to get a better idea you have to look at youtube subs instagram stuff like that on fb he has mill fetty wap with as much mainstream coverage has for example imagine the he gets on all his features shows future and drake just brought him out at a show thats basically illuminati shit now
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh god i didnt know it was red d i should have copped
hiphopheads,not_removed,he was not nearly as big back then
hiphopheads,not_removed,bryson is dope man i dont know how much he sold tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks for the commentary kendrick
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh yeah kevin gates is crazy as fuck but i personally think he knows how to play it off and every other radio interview hell be saying some deep shit and people are like damn this dude is talking real talk hes making great use of that psychology degree lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,which is probably why hhh loves him so much
hiphopheads,not_removed,that cover is exactly what made me want to listen to it i think its beautiful
hiphopheads,not_removed,you have friends stop bragging
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would say the same thing to op
hiphopheads,not_removed,that number honestly doesnt change anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,lyorcohen
hiphopheads,not_removed,camp lo remix is the best
hiphopheads,not_removed,im on the same boat my girl is the only other person i know who owns cds and ive bought of the cds shes gotten in the past two years
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly this thugger really doesnt make radio singles his hits kind of just happen like best friend even then he took a hook that someone else made and basically stole it off of jeffery can anyone really pinpoint a hot single that could get radio play closest ones i can think of are riri and swizz beats and imo you really have to like thugger and his style of music to feel those songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah whats the difference
hiphopheads,not_removed,this guys smart
hiphopheads,not_removed,also a year ago thug cancelled half of his tour and the rumors were bc the tickets werent selling his last tour in march was sold out cd sells dont mean anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,social media means nothing without turnover hes definetly not growing the way you think
hiphopheads,not_removed,you can number of fans liking your page and following you and shit but if no one or only a small percentage of those fans actually interacts with the artist those arent fans if you have over million fans on facebook you should be selling the equivalent of at least that is only of your fanbase at thats almost
hiphopheads,not_removed,only the limited edition is red goes for about on discogs so i suppose it was just the normal one at urban outfitters
hiphopheads,not_removed,really ive been following him since days and that seemed to be really big for him check is bigger than any of the songs on jeffery
hiphopheads,not_removed,he was huge back then whatre you talking about he had white high school girls covering his music on youtube and shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,trapsoul went platinum not first week obviously but he sold a shitton
hiphopheads,not_removed,i believe he sold like first week and that was before he even blew up then social media got a hold of dont and exchange and he went plat plat off trapsoul
hiphopheads,not_removed,has anybody ever proved gates really has a psychology degree i love gates but i honestly think hes talking out his ass when he says hes got a psych degree
hiphopheads,not_removed,i want him to make a harambe video wearing it
hiphopheads,not_removed,this ruined a banger it doesnt bang any more
hiphopheads,not_removed,seems a bit disingenuous to compare somebody with a platinum album overall albums on us charts hip hop albums mixtapes albums collab album with the biggest dude in the game selling out world tours touring with said biggest dude in the game followers on twitter and a wikipedia discography longer than almost anybody else ive ever seen to roscoe dash and kirko bangz who combined have released albums but no hey all the way turnt up and one verse on no hands totally makes you a viable comparison and that was just futureseems like if you dont know the difference between the two levels of artist you shouldnt be commenting on it in the first place
hiphopheads,not_removed,his shows sell out throughout the us and europe hes definately growing social media s and youtube views count for a lot theyre just not easy to see raw data like album sale s
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know how you can argue you should sell x amount of albums says who you
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont was huge before trapsoul dropped tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah well future made it but it wasnt too long ago he was looking like he was another roscoe type flash in the pan plus you sort of made my point if future didnt have a crazy output he probably would have been forgotten by now which is why future and thug dont take a year between projects or more that crazy output may not be enough for thugger though i mean is the type of stuff people are going to look back at in years from now and say he was literally just a roscoe dash i personally think thug will break through because hes got some really good catchy stuff and some traction but so did roscoe
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean at some point theres gonna be a guy in a suit asking why of a potential fanbase isnt interested in buying or streaming an album
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,you called them flash in the pan artists and then compared them to flash in the pan artists which is fine except future and thug arent flash in the pan artists for the explicit reasons i stated you cant honestly believe that they will be remembered with the likes of those artists when its all said and done or maybe you do and thats fine i just disagree with your comparisons
hiphopheads,not_removed,and that guy will compensate for the lack of album sales by taking cuts from his other more successful venues thats what mendo is implying basically album sales arent everything nowadays and some people may like him for his features others may like him for his controversy and others for his energy its not enough to push you to buy an album but you may go to his shows buy or listen to certain singles he releases or is featured on or be exposed to whatever product the guy in a suit will want him to push hes popular and theres money in popularity
hiphopheads,not_removed,has thug proven he isnt a flash in the pan and i already stated future has broken through but it wasnt looking much different for a while and i was just saying he does music that has notoriously been made by artists that fall off the face of the planet very fast i do think future will probably burn out faster than chance drake j cole kendrick and basically anybody of his current pedigree though
hiphopheads,not_removed,literally this
hiphopheads,not_removed,nice troll attempt
hiphopheads,not_removed,is this pasta
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree hes underrated but bobby tarantino being aoty is just a silly statement
hiphopheads,not_removed,why listen to logic when you can listen to all the people he bites
hiphopheads,not_removed,i personally just dont think hes as deep with his lyrics as he thinks he is and he bites other artists a little too hard for me dope artist though and hes found his audience which is a very loyal one just think he still has a ways to go as a rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,first hopsin now this you are really trying to piss this sub off
hiphopheads,not_removed,wtf bruh under pressure had a ton of features bino big sean
hiphopheads,not_removed,why do you gotta do him like that let him stan
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was the deluxe and thats not a ton retard lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,retard you the one defending logic
hiphopheads,not_removed,besides the typical fuck logic he bites too many rappers in what way is he bad he gets props from cudi nas rakim kendrick his production is consistently good he varies his flow unlike a lot of rappers who dont deserve the recognition theyre getting savage yachty uzi his albums actually have a theme and convey a positive message not to mention the dude busted his ass to get where hes at you may not like him as a rapper but to discredit his talent is fucking stupid
hiphopheads,not_removed,why listen to a corny version of those who he bites also the new rappers everyone loves to use as examples are too young to gauge what they have even though uzi and yachty have changed it up a bit
hiphopheads,not_removed,who do you think he bites
hiphopheads,not_removed,from the couple songs ive heard just cole and kendrick also if im not wrong i heard he just straight up took a travis scott beat
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow this is insane id love to hear the guys response please dont delete this mods i want to hear where this goes
hiphopheads,not_removed,what a fuckin goof this guy had to seriously try and think of what keef would say and make up answers and now he looks like a fool lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,hahahahahahahahahaha hes a fucking regular here ive seen him for a while his whole shit is done lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,urockotreez booked
hiphopheads,not_removed,as someone whose been publishing articles on my own blog for three years now wow why the fuck would you do that talk about shooting yourself in the foot thinking keef would never find out
hiphopheads,not_removed,i went to his twitter and he even tagged chief kief with a link to the interview😂
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is the interview in question httplocalsavagecomlocalsavageexclusiveaninterviewwithchiefkeef
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow amazing truly inspiring levels of second hand embarrassment
hiphopheads,not_removed,this whole situation is absolutely hilarious i actually really want to know what happens here because this situation is so absurd
hiphopheads,not_removed,in retrospect it was pretty weird that keef tweeted out that thot breaker and mansion musick were coming after two oh one seven only for us to learn a few days later in an interview that thot breaker was lost forever its one thing for him to announce projects and then never follow up with releasing them but straight up lying in a tweet about a project that would be impossible to release chief keefs social media presence is pretty weird but that doesnt sound like something he would do
hiphopheads,not_removed,bamboozled again
hiphopheads,not_removed,this damn sub
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol wow super interesting
hiphopheads,not_removed,niggas will do anything for some karma lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn i guess that means he didnt lose a tape in his emails
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe the guy paid for a fake interview
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpiimgurcomlbywedmgifv
hiphopheads,not_removed,welp that guys journalism career is over
hiphopheads,not_removed,chiraqean thats a new one
hiphopheads,not_removed,if he really faked this he did a really good job in my opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,rquityourbullshit
hiphopheads,not_removed,who is this chief kef you speak of

hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,trilleonaire have you seen his instagram the fuck is this shit

hiphopheads,not_removed,ive accepted that the old shit will never see light of day unless its leaked sosa was low on money this year and still never dove into his old catalog of music to compile a release man is a fucking goofy we need so many old songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think it was more for publicity and page clicks
hiphopheads,not_removed,i suck yo dick mane i got deez cheeseburgers mane scratches neck does pee dance
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i kind of wanted that to be true lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean no best case it was over the phone because it clearly wasnt over text because of shit like so some dude sounded enough like sosa to fool an interviewer and also took him up on the opportunity i doubt it
hiphopheads,not_removed,sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was fake
hiphopheads,not_removed,that guy earlier today made up shit about the surprise datpiff release too and the kanyecudi leaks
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats the convo
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was the op for that and it wasnt fake posted that number and i texted that phone legit it probably was just one of his friends working with him in the studio
hiphopheads,not_removed,i believe a wise prophet once said no one man should have all that power
hiphopheads,not_removed,mods seem to move like fuck niggas pretty often they need to communicate with us
hiphopheads,not_removed,cam never loved you
hiphopheads,not_removed,cam couldnt delete you from his life you were never in it to begin with
hiphopheads,not_removed,we are at your mercy

hiphopheads,not_removed,so it was fake then
hiphopheads,not_removed,edgy
hiphopheads,not_removed,sadly yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,i can hold you if you want
hiphopheads,not_removed,wise prophet nah its just some crazy dude who said that
hiphopheads,not_removed,a false prophet
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre too busy jerking off on hhh twitter
hiphopheads,not_removed,he straight up ignored him
hiphopheads,not_removed,keef in here pranking and flaming people forsure wouldnt be surprised if keef is fucking with us with this whole thing such a trickster that chief keef is
hiphopheads,not_removed,the writer was on twitter tagging chief keef in the interview link assuming he wouldnt see it smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok bad example cuz thats a meme from rthepack and that subreddit is fucking hilarious
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit youre not kidding this is so cringeworthy
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean chief keef said it was so yea
hiphopheads,not_removed,uh those things arent really remotely the same in any way no doxingposting peoples personal information is one of reddits biggest rules and it can get you permabanned dudes a fuckhead for sure but he doesnt deserve his info getting out on a place as big as this the backlash from this interview will do damage in a better way anyways
hiphopheads,not_removed,aww
hiphopheads,not_removed,name one genius that aint crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,a crazy hermit that lives on tattooine
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats the point of hhh twitter
hiphopheads,not_removed,more like chief deceif
hiphopheads,not_removed,really though he is the kinda guy to do that shit if you follow him at all on social media you would realize lmao dude will go at a year old on gta if he felt like it gotta love him
hiphopheads,not_removed,its an ironic meme style that started on facebook see gangster popeye cabbage cat and spread to reddit see rthepack its not sincere
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres no point its just a reference point for people who used this subreddit and are active on twitter to keep in touch if youre not already on twitter theres no point or appeal
hiphopheads,not_removed,but you posted it here no need for that
hiphopheads,not_removed,im just tellin you man its the rules of reddit trying to help you out so you dont get permabanned no need to be defensive about it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wasnt being sarcastic i was just wondering if it just links to posts on this sub or is like the hhh forum thing but that makes sense
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes billions of them actually
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck that wack shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,any constructive criticism is appreciated
hiphopheads,not_removed,send this to the top of the sub please
hiphopheads,not_removed,new westside gunn is always a good thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,griselda stays delivering

hiphopheads,not_removed,hit the kitchen like nitro leg dropped a brick like hogan nigga nasty
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was just thinking the same they might as well collab on one their styles would fit really well i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,black metaphor can do no wrong the last snippet towards the ned of this song is going to be on from what i hear
hiphopheads,not_removed,till wor an l
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love michael christmas and this song just further reinforces that for me with lordfubus production and michaels flow it just works well
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont like run the jewels im sorry
hiphopheads,not_removed,cents flow is horrible
hiphopheads,not_removed,albums made recently that try to emulate a sound from the are boring as shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hated watch the throne yeezus is kanye wests best album i cant listen to eminem for more than minutes his voice is just so annoying kanyes a better producer than dre
hiphopheads,not_removed,chance the rapper is overrated and sounds like hes talking to a baby all the time college dropout is yes worst album desiigner is better than future is joey badas only good project lil yachty is a lot smarter than everyone thinks he is war pain is better than charged up florida will overtake atlanta before yall know it charlie heat is the best producer in the game at making bangers
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like kanye but i dont see him as the best in the game coloring book is chances best project em is the goat
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like lil uzi vert part on bad and boujee yeezus is kanyes best project free is better than starboy mac miller is the best white rapper rich chigga up next fuck your local rapper not really an opinion i still dont get tpab like what was the message i think i understand it but could someone explain it to me not hiphop related but carly rae jepsens emotion is the greatest piece of art that has graced our pitiful existence has human beings and jamie xxs in colour comes in at a close second
hiphopheads,not_removed,danny brown is mad overrated
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil uzi is complete trash i want to like absoul but he just doesnt make that great of music i fucked with divine feminine but only on occasion untitled unmastered was better than tpab russ is ass but hes got a banger i probably listened to alex wiley more than any other artist in isiah rashad is better than q though they arent in the same lane blank face was good but ive never once felt like i was in the mood to listen to it is corn
hiphopheads,not_removed,yachty should be inducted into wu
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really cant get into danny brown at all his voice is extremely obnoxious and i couldnt put myself to listening through his whole album i think i only got threw a few songs from aa before quitting chance is overrated hes not bad by any means but hers certainly not one of the best in the game currently drake is overrated as fuck and has been on a steady downfall since back to back which was also overrated with a few exceptions everything he has put out since has been painfully mediocre i dont mind uzis verse on bad and boujee meek is a better rapper than drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,biggie and are only considered goat because they were killed not to say they arent top or even top but theyve been glorified waaaay too much for the sake of selling more posthumous records
hiphopheads,not_removed,you have to be under to think kid cudi ever made good music
hiphopheads,not_removed,blus godleebarneslp is his best body of work
hiphopheads,not_removed,its fine if you and i have different views on the same rapper for example i like chance the rapper but if you dislike him well thats okay
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake is just another pop artist kanye is overrated blonde was a disappointed album from frank
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like future
hiphopheads,not_removed,the best jazz rap album is blowout comb by digable planets not something by tribe
hiphopheads,not_removed,mbdtf is not even a top kanye album not that its bad but it really doesnt match up with some of his other work i respect the fact that its universally loved widely considered his best work but ive just never connected to in the same way personally i would rank them like this late registration yeezus graduation college dropout mbdtf the life of pablo
hiphopheads,not_removed,danny brown and anderson paak are overrated af kendrick is the best rapper alive and kills every feature and verse fuck u chances best project coloring book tlop is one kanyes best projects if youre reading this is overrated af one of drakes worst projects his best is take care then nwts birds was great and travis is making some of the best music rn also he has cosigns from amazing people i always skip ultralight beam on tlop fade is one of the best songs on there
hiphopheads,not_removed,you shouldnt support artists that are reprehensible people as the fact is that fan indifference is what allows them to get away with bad shit while its hard to give up music you loved its very easy to just not check out the latest dr drer kelly album so that they dont get any more of your money or attention voting with your wallet is the only way the industry is going to give a shit other unpopular opinions new and hot is overrated compared to artists that are older and masters of their craft but dont get as much attention id rather see an artist develop than listen to someone new and unpolished drake is such a blatant wave rider and the fact all of you keep making excuses for him saps my respect for all of you odd future was so dumb in retrospect that it makes it impossible to take any of the new crop of meme rappers seriously lil yachtyuzi especially
hiphopheads,not_removed,yezus is is better lyrically and maybe musically than mdbtf
hiphopheads,not_removed,xxxtentacion is ass
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake is a pussy and his music is shit kanye isnt that good only has one incredible album imo mick jenkins kinda bores me lil yachty has one too many chromosomes
hiphopheads,not_removed,culture wasnt very good migos themselves arent good rappers and dont make good music that doesnt mean the music isnt fun
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeezus and tlop are trash chance the rapper is overrated drake puts out mediocre rb hiphop pick a genre for a album and stick to it migos savage lil yacht and lil uzi put out wack music yall need to listen to some nas pac and jay to clean your ears
hiphopheads,not_removed,white peoples taste in hip hop is garbage
hiphopheads,not_removed,these threads suck ass
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really dont like mumble rap i think its pretty awful if you like it god bless but its not me every song on culture sounded the same to me watch the throne was ok at best also it shouldve been nas and jay instead of kanye but quality par for the course with jay in the ferg has yet to put out a good album mixtapes should be free especially if youre an established star j cole puts me to sleep
hiphopheads,not_removed,upvoting you because your opinions made me want to downvote you
hiphopheads,not_removed,last one i never tell people that i rank tlop so high because i know ill get weird looks
hiphopheads,not_removed,life of pablo is kanyes second best album only to mbdtf bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,the last statement makes me want to kill myself lmao i enjoy pablo but bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,tpab is mad overrated this is simultaneously the most true and the most controversial statement you made
hiphopheads,not_removed,tpab is mad overrated go fuck yourself
hiphopheads,not_removed,life of pablo is kanyes second best album only to mbdtf any time someone ranks tlop so high thats how you know theyre most likely newer kanye fans i know opinions and all but this one is such a stupid one tlop one of yes worst albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,stop nah depends what youre looking for in kendrick probably true no
hiphopheads,not_removed,im totally with you on and
hiphopheads,not_removed,im genuinely mad at the last one
hiphopheads,not_removed,same listened to the first one i think years back dont care enough to listen to the other two
hiphopheads,not_removed,modern production
hiphopheads,not_removed,false joey bada
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with the yachty one yachty is a bit brighter than he lets on all of his dumb shit is most likely a publicity stunt and its clearly working also half agree with the desiigner thing cant fully agree because i didnt like new english until i revisited it a few weeks back and im not sure if itll stay with me
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was roller coaster of what the fuck are you talking about to this dude knows what the fuck is up
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah kinda hes not bad but hes mad overrated nah nah havent listened to it in a while but bada was really good dont really listen to him much easily serious question but who tf even is from florida im sure there is some super obvious answers but i cant think of any off the top of my head havent really heard much of him outside of the songs he produced on campaign so i cant comment on that
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like college dropout but i dont love it as much as everyone else does too many skits and weak af drums
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes no yes maybe yes idk hopefully because atlanta has been fucking terrible over the past few years idk
hiphopheads,not_removed,is joey badas only good project i wouldnt say only good but i agree is so much better than his other shit including he really has to hit it out the park with his next album but i like the way he is haeding with land of the free
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont agree with most of it but is a huge win
hiphopheads,not_removed,coloring book is chances best project boi
hiphopheads,not_removed,people see him as the best in the game
hiphopheads,not_removed,i prefer coloring book to acid rap too
hiphopheads,not_removed,delet number
hiphopheads,not_removed,im with you on yeezus
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wont go to your lengths and say its the one of the best ever but jamie xxs in colour is honestly the greatest electronic album of all time also there are a ton of videos and articles that explain tpab genius has a great write up of it in particular
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,on this sub
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to xxx every release theres more of his obnoxious voice and less actual rapping theres plenty of normal shit on xxx though
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh ill fight you over that uzi verse
hiphopheads,not_removed,real for meek
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like this is partially true for j dilla too
hiphopheads,not_removed,i disagree with most of what you said but i upvoted you just because of how much i agree with your unironically euthanized statement xxxtennisballs stans swear he is so much more popular and influential than he actually is that its sickening
hiphopheads,not_removed,slime season is the only coherent release young thug has ever put out coherent cohesive or good because i dont know how youre measuring this culture was shit i tried listening to it on release and it wasjust ok i sure wasnt on what people were on in the release thread ultralight beam isnt that good there is no version of tlop in which ulb is better than fade hold my liquor is the greatest song kanye ever released maybe i prefer coldest winter but i see your argument
hiphopheads,not_removed,ultralight beam isnt that good this is like in when the dude meets another person fed up wit the system that song is so lamei could go the rest of my life without hearing it again
hiphopheads,not_removed,what exactly does owl pharoah do better than rodeo i feel its a step down in almost everything compared to rodeo maybe it could be argued its more creative but i dont think it was executed very well also x being most talented under could be true but whos he really up against its not saying much
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with some things here but you say trap needs to stop and then compliment a bunch of trap artists
hiphopheads,not_removed,with you on hold my liquor no idea why its not considered an all time classic fucking brilliant composition
hiphopheads,not_removed,your beat of the year thing doesnt make sense x is trash kendrick is a god
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait so you think day is chances best tape because acid rap is generally considered to be the best right i can obviously see you calling cb mediocre
hiphopheads,not_removed,live love asap is bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant tell if youre actually serious about some of these or just saying it
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont mean to take the fun out of this but this isnt an opinion though because there are plenty of year olds that do like his music
hiphopheads,not_removed,im man on the moon is a personal classic
hiphopheads,not_removed,blonde is the only album ive ever had click for me give it another try
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with yeezus and tlop last but mbdtf not being is disgusting take your upvote
hiphopheads,not_removed,so theyre all equally good
hiphopheads,not_removed,graduation at is a fucking heinous opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,danny yes paak no nas is still alive my guy delete this nephew define one of like top top nwts is actually his best js i also really enjoyed birds heathen ultralight beam does drag on pretty long i will agree also who skips the first track on an album smh fade is cool tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,i totally agree with the chance ye and drake statements especially with the drake one i feel like iyrtitl is hella overrated
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean does this extend to other forms of art as well so many hollywood actors and directors are dirty schmucks but should i not watch their movies whats the line you know
hiphopheads,not_removed,what hiphop do you like
hiphopheads,not_removed,the thing i dont like is that they try to fit in every member in each song which makes it a bit too long sometimes i think its a for now but gotta listen more
hiphopheads,not_removed,your first opinion is wrong very popular opinion here lately yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,none of these are unpopular opinions
hiphopheads,not_removed,we all have the same taste ill go notify my friend he is now a future fan
hiphopheads,not_removed,high five bro sick white people diss
hiphopheads,not_removed,young thug is correctly rated nwtstake care are his best currensy has sucked for a while agreed disagree agree i mean hes a ghostwriter so agreed and disagree about yeezus using scotts help yeezus did have coproduction from travis but yeezus sounds nothing like travis druggy luxury trap music
hiphopheads,not_removed,pilot talk was good
hiphopheads,not_removed,cool
hiphopheads,not_removed,and you would deserve them too
hiphopheads,not_removed,gkmc is better
hiphopheads,not_removed,it is people were ranking it with kid a its a very good album but it looks backwards sonically it does an established sound well but doesnt do a whole lot to innovate or push the ball forward
hiphopheads,not_removed,newer or older what does it matter your opinion isnt held higher cause youve been a fan longer
hiphopheads,not_removed,or maybe just maybe they liked tlop better than kanyes other albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant remember a single thing from it now
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just think yachty has social anxiety
hiphopheads,not_removed,serious question but who tf even is from florida im sure there is some super obvious answers but i cant think of any off the top of my head just off the top of my head xxx yung simmie denzel ski mask kodak smokepurpp pouya fat nick robb bank and it seems like another hyped up florida rapper pops up every other week
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats your favourite project of his
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like to toooo
hiphopheads,not_removed,it honestly frustrates me that i have no one to talk to about in colour such an amazing album edit loud places honestly changed my life twice on the first listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,fade is the best song on tlop
hiphopheads,not_removed,sorry i shouldnt have said coherent i just meant that its his only decent release also i didnt say ulb is worse than fade it isnt
hiphopheads,not_removed,ultralight beam is like dark fantasys underachiever little brother
hiphopheads,not_removed,is it the gospel that you dont like cause i think thats why a lot of this sub doesnt like coloring book
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just prefer it rodeo has more trap influences and since i hate that subgenre its not as good to me as to x yeah he doesnt have a huge amount of competition but the weight of the judgement is subjective you can look at it how you wish
hiphopheads,not_removed,who did i compliment owl pharaoh and dbr to a much lesser extent arent really trap which is why i said traviss releases are from best to worst coherentgood a lot of it is trash but its better than anything else hes put out and i hope you arent gonna tell me x is trap
hiphopheads,not_removed,im pretty sure hes saying owl pharoah is travis best work
hiphopheads,not_removed,instant goosebumps when the outro kicks in every time
hiphopheads,not_removed,the beat of the year thing was in regards to hhhs awards thing that went on a little while ago i swear aint it funny was voted the best and it was above real friends although i agree that i worded it poorly
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah day is his best tape i dont really dislike any song on it and i love nostalgia im a sucker for beats like that and he doesnt do any of his obnoxious voices on the song
hiphopheads,not_removed,serious about every one
hiphopheads,not_removed,im over and his first few albums are great after motm naw
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah but their opinions are shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i guess but you should have grown out of it by now i get how sixteen year olds liked it ten years ago but its time to grow up motm is lyrically and musically just kind of juvenile and not in the good youthful unrestrained kind of way the lyrics are trite and uninspired the melodies and production are predictable and sound right out of a theme song to some kids show it sounds like a very good first attempt at making music certainly showing potential but too unrefined to be good enough to show anyone
hiphopheads,not_removed,im and i spent two or three years listening to hybrid theory but i know its not a classic
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre all good to varying degrees but i wouldnt say their equal personally speaking lr at number one is probably around a while tlop is about a imo all the others obviously fall in between that range that said i enjoy all of his albums i just think that mbdtf is severely overhyped
hiphopheads,not_removed,deleted
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i feel like its his most popular project because its mostly trap beats i like trap but damn that project is not good outside of songs maybe at best
hiphopheads,not_removed,take care better than nwts though
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait the guy only named artists he doesnt like
hiphopheads,not_removed,classics i imagine
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like way too many to list but my top favorite artists are kendrick aap rocky chance isaiah rashad tut schoolboy q migos savage joey badass travis scott flatbush zombies denzel curry j cole kinda anderson paak bas childish gambino kid cudi quentin miller rtj vince staples
hiphopheads,not_removed,deleted
hiphopheads,not_removed,you see it as a diss i see it as a fact that its less likely that white people listened to as children
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant say i disagree tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah but its very telling on when you started listening to hip hop andor began to like kanye im not a backpacker by any means but i feel a lot of fans that started to come around beginning with and on dont really care about lyricism songwriting or songalbum structure they give way too many passes on things like struggle bars because vibes
hiphopheads,not_removed,or maybe just maybe stay the fuck off the internet if you dont want your opinions criticized check through my last couple replies in the thread i gave reasons why i feel that way
hiphopheads,not_removed,sure its lyrically his worst but im not really looking for great bars in a kanye album why not its not like he cant do sonically adventurous shit and have good bars i think all of his previous albums does album structure just as well as tlop if not better but they all also have much better flows lyricism and song structure on top of that and its not that he isnt capable anymore tlop has a couple of my favorite ye songs but the majority of the album falls flat
hiphopheads,not_removed,survival instincts that song is absolute flames
hiphopheads,not_removed,paper trail piece of mind heuzus view number on and on just to name a few
hiphopheads,not_removed,so basically just soundcloud rappers so far but yeah i dont really listen to many of them apart from kodak
hiphopheads,not_removed,kodak black
hiphopheads,not_removed,imo acid rap is his best and coloring book isnt very good other than a handful of tracks summer friends angels and another one i cant remember
hiphopheads,not_removed,acid rap fosho
hiphopheads,not_removed,deleted
hiphopheads,not_removed,no gospel is fine i just find the song incredibly boring
hiphopheads,not_removed,x and ski mask are both trap artists lmao they both rap about trapping over trap instrumentals
hiphopheads,not_removed,yup
hiphopheads,not_removed,mike deans guitars on that track are insane
hiphopheads,not_removed,gotcha
hiphopheads,not_removed,interesting i respect your opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,ever
hiphopheads,not_removed,lr has the majority of kanyes best verses imho
hiphopheads,not_removed,there are way more modern hip hop artists than those four
hiphopheads,not_removed,well that still makes it a diss and regardless that doesnt make your taste superior
hiphopheads,not_removed,hazeus view and paper trails are on
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love the majority of the album tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats fair
hiphopheads,not_removed,you are so hurt lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah its not a diss youre just sensitive as if growing up with different music is some handicap to your life
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck thats what i meant not been bumping summer nights
hiphopheads,not_removed,ur retort game is fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,you just said that an entire race of people have a shitty music taste how is that not a diss and your the one implying that not growing up with that music is the handicap im not disagreeing that most white kids didnt grow up with hip hop but that doesnt mean that every single white person has a shitty taste in music dont generalize races man look where the country is at cuz of that rn
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol i never implied anyone was a better person for having a good taste in hip hop youre just sensitive
hiphopheads,not_removed,i never said you did all i said was white people inherently dont have a worse taste in music honestly the issue wasnt with that you thought someone or some group of peoples taste was trash its that you were generalizing an entire race thats racist dude even against white people and notice that your the only one throwing insults here
hiphopheads,not_removed,you keep saying music when the subject genre is hip hop are you saying hip hop is the only good music cause then what youre saying might make sense but anyway i stand by what i said white people have a shit taste in hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,im talking about hip hop but whatever theres a lotta white hip hop heads out there with great taste and a lot of people in the industry that are white you are saying that regardless of what they know or do theyre taste is trash because they are white
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah i have no need to qualify what im saying the white people who grew up with hip hop know who they are and dont care the only people who would be offended are those who believe i have a point
hiphopheads,not_removed,ahh your craft has a nice unique style to i wait no it doesnt
hiphopheads,not_removed,share
hiphopheads,not_removed,what a line up this looks good
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit i like the looks of that
hiphopheads,not_removed,slaps probably my favorite off the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,do the adlibs or whatever they are after p much every line remind anyone else of made in the usa by lupe i like it punctuated the lines really well in that song and sounds alright in this one too
hiphopheads,not_removed,as seen as in the instagram snippet he posted whilst calling out logic for copying his artwork for his album
hiphopheads,not_removed,this one homesick and andrea are probably my favs of this album he goes hard from the beginning to the end though e amnesia makes me wanna see quint go off and break another chair
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song fits the cover art so well
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song always puts me in a good mood
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre all actually one person that is split into entities when they enter a studio they combine from the amigos into migo
hiphopheads,not_removed,quavo and offset are cousins and quavo is takeoffs uncle
hiphopheads,not_removed,ask google
hiphopheads,not_removed,they are amigos
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre all brothers and theyre all the sons of gucci

hiphopheads,not_removed,relapse and big sean finally famous
hiphopheads,not_removed,apparently people didnt like jesus piece by the game but i love it so much
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wouldnt call it disliked but i think graduation isnt really appreciated as much as the rest of kanyes catalog me personally its my favorite album ever made next to discovery by daft punk it changed my life and its probably one of my favorite things on earth
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeezus
hiphopheads,not_removed,adventures of bobby ray bob

hiphopheads,not_removed,desiigners new english i fuck with all of that
hiphopheads,not_removed,views i really like the project even though it might not be drakes best work
hiphopheads,not_removed,the weeknd beauty behind the madness even though at first listen it completely repulsed me with each listen it grows on me as a more relatable journey through the weeknds life than kiss land my favorite project of his or trilogy and i think he mixes pop and altdark rnb better than i imagined
hiphopheads,not_removed,lasers and views
hiphopheads,not_removed,always strive and prosper big seans hall of fame and kid cudis satellite flight
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeezus and and heartbreak
hiphopheads,not_removed,views idc if its take care imo its a better version of take care except drake isnt singing enough on views so less good singing drake songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a piece of shit by father
hiphopheads,not_removed,relative to the rest of kanyes discography and heartbreaks its genuinely my favourite ye album and in the right mood i think it comes together better than anything else hes made kill me
hiphopheads,not_removed,hall of fame and im not even really a fan of big sean either
hiphopheads,not_removed,speedin bullet heaven
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love finally rollin seems a lot of people thought it was mediocrebad
hiphopheads,not_removed,tonnes of people here hated views but it really just clicked with me i didnt really have high expectations im not saying its amazing and groundbreaking or anything but its just fun good songs i am more of an rb fan than hiphop though so that might be why i enjoy it more because i do agree that the hiphop tracks off the album were more forgettable
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,relapse
hiphopheads,not_removed,encore has a few disgustingly bad songs on it but the majority of the album is good to great i love kingdom come never understood the hate for this album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i liked speeding bullet heaven
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like no one really talks about nights love that tape
hiphopheads,not_removed,and heartbreak
hiphopheads,not_removed,i liked relapse a ton too there are a good amount of throwaway tracks but the good tracks are increidble
hiphopheads,not_removed,big seans corny af
hiphopheads,not_removed,who the fuck hates on jesus piece shits so nice then you find out it was scrapped and the version we have now was thrown together in months shit is unholy for months
hiphopheads,not_removed,how did it change your life
hiphopheads,not_removed,depends who you run with on twitter people will say its his best album but here people say its his worst im in the latter camp but i also think kanye has no bad albums so i understand any favorite
hiphopheads,not_removed,graduation is my favorite predeity kanye album i love the themeambiancefeel of the whole album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel with yeezus you either love it or hate no in between
hiphopheads,not_removed,here i got you fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,this one grew on me more after a few listens that being said im a huge fan of father so it was only a matter of time for me to like it anyways
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats my second favorite album of all time my favorite work by kanye
hiphopheads,not_removed,could you explain what you like about it to try and convince me to give it another listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,nice try scott
hiphopheads,not_removed,u wot
hiphopheads,not_removed,cmon most people recognize the influence of on hhh
hiphopheads,not_removed,the most underrated classic ever
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats ok its just fun
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant speak for op but graduation and lupe fiascos the cool changed the way i hear music i was a top music kid until i was given those albums and that started my deep love for music and now i listen to full albums of all kinds of genres ill always consider them as two of my favorite albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh it looks like a list to me on my phone i probably fucked up the formatting my bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,connected album theory
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like it too but i dont think its an album you can convince people to like i can defend to death and other albums like that but is just something you either like or you hate i think i just really like the lyrical themes im usually not big on lyrics at all the overall tone of the album which taps into just not giving a fuck in a rebellious almost teenageangst way i dont care if im in my i still fuck with that
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont bother
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats more of a recent thing though now that were living in the future to see its influence it was clowned on so hard when it first came out maybe a its an area thing but most of the hiphopheads i know irl still clown on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,just vibes bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was clowned on so hard when it first came out i remember having to valiantly defend it when people clowned on it constantly when it came out well youre not laughing now are you
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly thats what i meant not holy crap this turned out to be influential good but the fact that it was good from the beginning i dont know why these people are tryna stunt and down vote me as if everybody was rocking with this album to begin with i think it does a great job of experimentation both in sound and showing the versatility of emotions after breakup amazing feels a little out of place in context but its still well amazing plus this album is a excellent display of kanyes signature indulgence ie letting the instrumental do most of the talking
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wish they had more collabs
hiphopheads,not_removed,reverseshoutout to whoever is down voting everything in the new section fuck off pls anyway i hope this is nothing cuz i love both drake and makkonen
hiphopheads,not_removed,makkonen talked shit about ovo and drake a couple of months backnow he starts getting hate and becoming less relevant so he wants to go back hip hop is weird
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a big fan of both i wish i could have seen makonnen prosper on ovo but hes seems like hes found a better niche lately

hiphopheads,not_removed,is ur bed made
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats good by toro y moi
hiphopheads,not_removed,thx
hiphopheads,not_removed,completely agree frank just makes perfect summer music
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think migos absolutely kill it on this song really enjoyed quavo and particularly offsets verse i do have one criticism though which is i think the intro is a bit long its seconds into the song before any actual singing starts kinda kills the mood as a great party tune for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,i enjoyed it but i dont think its amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song is going to be huge i dont know how it hasnt instantly exploded where im at yet but its a matter of time this is a perfect laid back song when offset cuts in o lawd ive never heard anything smoother its definitely made to be a radio hit but its the best of its kind and stays in its own lane
hiphopheads,not_removed,its pretty good not amazing replay value but really smooth
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought it was okay until i heard it played at bootsy last week and fell in love with it
hiphopheads,not_removed,overrated song imo maybe its just already played out for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,its decent i kinda laughed when i saw pitchfork write when frank makes radio hits theyre more than just a radio hit im sorry but he made a decent radio hit stop hyping him up so much coming from a frank stan
hiphopheads,not_removed,super underwhelming for me and i dont think i had really high expectations
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think a lot of people here dont understand mainstream pop either ill be surprised if this song is huge especially with that pitch shifted intro
hiphopheads,not_removed,he murdered the competition
hiphopheads,not_removed,undeniably an all time great
hiphopheads,not_removed,compared to whats popular right nowsure
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,what in the fuck are you saying
hiphopheads,not_removed,u got any links fam or you just gonna talk sheeeit
hiphopheads,not_removed,translating for future confused hhhers ive been pretty critical of drake up until now but a friend showed me u with me off of his most recent album views and i really loved it i tried to play it off cool in front of him though but since ive been home ive played that part after the beat changes from about to like fucking times drake isnt all that bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk if anyone gonna pay dollar for a shirt with text on it you gotta atleast put a unique design on there check on rstreetwearstartup if u need help with anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,second verse goes in
hiphopheads,not_removed,youve been sitting on this for days lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,tonight we play tell me when to go and this on repeat
hiphopheads,not_removed,swet shop boys cashmere phone tap and more heems eat pray a thug flag shopping and patriot act heems soup boys
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks going to listen to each of these
hiphopheads,not_removed,pnd lowkey sounding like thugga in some parts of the track
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres two names i would never expect to collab lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,other way around yachty ft party edit confirmed party
hiphopheads,not_removed,yachty really the center of the scene right now hes everywhere
hiphopheads,not_removed,yachty actually fits much better on this track than i thought he would
hiphopheads,not_removed,you never stunted until you met a nigga like meeeeeeee lil boat sounding real nice on this one fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly lil boat is growing on me listening to his interviews really helped me enjoy his music more this is dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,pnds songs have been all over the place recently not in quality but in sound i guess the features have a major impact but putting this next to come see without knowing who pnd is i would never guess its the same artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,didnt expect yachty to kill this beat so hard
hiphopheads,not_removed,heres the soundcloud link
hiphopheads,not_removed,all aboard the partyboat
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is really good
hiphopheads,not_removed,loved broccoli so much but cant get into any other yachty no matter how hard i try
hiphopheads,not_removed,love this sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,i honestly hate lil yatchy not necessarily because of his music but the fact that he makes me realize i am actually getting older
hiphopheads,not_removed,fucking atrocious mixing but love this song actually more impressed with yachty on this than pnd
hiphopheads,not_removed,they actually mesh and bounce off each other really well love the track
hiphopheads,not_removed,is it called hunnid pack or buzzin
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont usually listen to pnd much but i really enjoyed him on this anyone have suggestions on other pnd songs that sounds kinda like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,does anyone know oliver el khatibs email
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck with this song heavy smoove
hiphopheads,not_removed,can someone post the soundcloud link this site on mobile is strange for some reason
hiphopheads,not_removed,great song and really nice delivery from yachty i must say that murda did his thing as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo i just got internet herpes from u this website is total garbage downvoting for not just linking to the soundcloud edit
hiphopheads,not_removed,out as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,pnd is overrated at the moment this song sucks
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought he sounded very similar to thugger in like that i think well see more of this style in
hiphopheads,not_removed,came to this thread specifically to see if anyone else thought that lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,id say its safe to say that a lot of big projects in will have yachty in it seems like everybody wants to collab with him
hiphopheads,not_removed,expect any big name to collab with yachty hes got the wave going right now everyone wants to jump on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,really feeling that cover art
hiphopheads,not_removed,sounds like a party track though
hiphopheads,not_removed,obviously this is freaking trash for partys standards
hiphopheads,not_removed,paak and yachty are the real up and comers this year everybody has some interest in them
hiphopheads,not_removed,please god end it
hiphopheads,not_removed,well its his song so i would hope so
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont you disagreeeee
hiphopheads,not_removed,i honestly wouldnt have started listening to him if i didnt see his breakfast interview the guy showed hes just as real as they ever come after him i now will no longer judge a rapper by how they look
hiphopheads,not_removed,good now let me hear you say lil boat
hiphopheads,not_removed,nooooo your starting to surrender to this trash edit thx for gold idk y tho lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,its actually a yachty track so that my explain why it doesnt sound like a typical pnd track
hiphopheads,not_removed,i plan on jumping on the train where should i begin with yachty
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah holy crap i didnt expect this
hiphopheads,not_removed,night all times and minnesota
hiphopheads,not_removed,right now and west district imo bryson tiller also has similar songs idk if you ever checked him out or not
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,mods finna delete this
hiphopheads,not_removed,there was no soundcloud link until a few hours after it dropped they were the first one that had it
hiphopheads,not_removed,nice analysis
hiphopheads,not_removed,who wouldnt he seems like a cool person just to hang around
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought drake would have already jumped on yachty
hiphopheads,not_removed,how does he consistently have amazing cover arts
hiphopheads,not_removed,yachty really cares about artwork
hiphopheads,not_removed,that cover is dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,party probably had a hand in the production and this also might be yachty trying a different sound which im down for
hiphopheads,not_removed,yachty forever
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol i know its not positive but it actually gives me visceral pleasure when people make statements like this about yachtys music yachty forever bitch
hiphopheads,not_removed,can we just rewind hip hop back to please😦😤😖😫😣
hiphopheads,not_removed,sounds like a pnd track though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i gave you everything you need
hiphopheads,not_removed,his sway interview was dope and calling up ebro as well made me like him more
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil boat
hiphopheads,not_removed,are you some special snowflake because you dont enjoy it this seems like a pretty arbitrary thing to have a superiority complex about
hiphopheads,not_removed,nooooo stop liking music that i dont like
hiphopheads,not_removed,this trash is on 🔥🔥🔥
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive been resisting for so long 🙈
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao rip coalworld
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre
hiphopheads,not_removed,one night is his biggest song so look out for that beyond catchy other than that minnesota no hook especially this one and king of the teens are good
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk ill check it out annoying as fuck instead of recommending me songs i might like of his i get downvoted for saying i havent found one yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you ill check them out
hiphopheads,not_removed,minnesota is so fucking garbage lmao stop recommending that song do not check out minnesota that shit is horrible
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks for the suggestions will definitely check em out i like bryson tiller i dont know him much besides dont and sorry not sorry but what ive heard ive liked
hiphopheads,not_removed,and ban him for a day
hiphopheads,not_removed,what was it lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,i still love you fam its just a real bad website
hiphopheads,not_removed,i fuck w yachty but just bc hes a cool person to be around doesnt mean that hes a good person to collab with
hiphopheads,not_removed,kodak
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes the only one that cares
hiphopheads,not_removed,boats look cool
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes really fashionable its no surprise he puts a lot of effort in art selection
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok
hiphopheads,not_removed,you say lil boat
hiphopheads,not_removed,im pretty sure this was sarcasm
hiphopheads,not_removed,just because someone doesnt like one rapper from the new school doesnt mean they went a full resurgence of boom bap relax
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah before he was born
hiphopheads,not_removed,so you can watch pac die again if its just because you like the music i assure you its still here
hiphopheads,not_removed,dusty
hiphopheads,not_removed,i will stand for what i believe in regardless on the perception it recieves
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,i used to also dislike yachty bc i thought he was really corny but after i gave lil boat the mixtape a listen i was totally hooked so if you are looking to get into yachty lil boat is a good place to start as the guy above said
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh also if you like broccoli definitely check out his verse in bankroll mafia hyenas
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre garbage
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,just a shitpost with like emojis
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is important i always fucked with riff raff cause he was entertaining as a character but his music wasnt always my favorite i feel similar about yachty
hiphopheads,not_removed,he is though hes one of the hottest artist right now
hiphopheads,not_removed,uzi vert tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil goat
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil boat
hiphopheads,not_removed,i say lil kim
hiphopheads,not_removed,i say biggie smalls
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,boom bap disgusting
hiphopheads,not_removed,sorry
hiphopheads,not_removed,you wont him though
hiphopheads,not_removed,son i was kidding lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,naw like rip coal world cuz yachty forever
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil boat is the tightest mixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah some artist just take me a minute young thug i wrote off but tried to get into him after i heard great stuff and found the guide and now im a fan im hoping the same happens with yachty i dont care about the karmaim always saying some dumb shit i know will get downvoted for fun but its frustrating to have a genuine question buried
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you
hiphopheads,not_removed,man come on i can take new rap but that song is straight garbage
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really want to like yachty because i love his whole vibe and character and he comes across in interviews as a super chill dude unfortunately like of what he puts out is poor quality edit this is hot though he always sounds so much better on someone other than burberry perry beats when the production is actually a decent level
hiphopheads,not_removed,his features are super consistent too i wanna listen to any song i see hes featured on
hiphopheads,not_removed,literally only on hiphopheads and ktt lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,he was referring to yachtys verse on chances song mixtape am i the only one that still care about cover art
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil uzi covers are trash
hiphopheads,not_removed,boat stands for best of all time straight from yachty
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes in
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh sorry haha a s would probably come in handy next time
hiphopheads,not_removed,sorry me no conversate with the low karma fakes
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you like thug try minnesota remix by yachty it features young thug and quavo and its one his most popular songs i also think its one of his best
hiphopheads,not_removed,id also like to recommend his dog with offset off his newest tape im happy some people still experiment with music instead of calling it trash
hiphopheads,not_removed,have you listened to any of summer songs yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,are you saying that perrys beats arent good
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree i like this one about as much i liked him on mixtape with chance
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude what i agree that a lot of his songs are bad but some of his perry songs are his best dont be ignant
hiphopheads,not_removed,i get sad when he not featured on a song tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,consistently sloppy and bad imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,he has three songs in the top of apple music right now with the highest at which coincidentally also just went gold
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude i live in regional australia and he is hot amongst anyone who listens to at least a bit of hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol the internet is a strange place
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes huge in the soundcloud community
hiphopheads,not_removed,do you know anyone in college or high school even slightly into hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,i strongly disagree
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmfao i thought that the emojis would have done the job
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly i kinda flipped through it a couple of times nothing grabbed me im gonna give it a proper listen later today
hiphopheads,not_removed,being featured on songs that teenagers play on apple music a bunch of times doesnt make you one of the hottest rappers out there
hiphopheads,not_removed,define a bit
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty much everyone i interact with yeah out of the active members of a rap facebook group im in all but one or two think hes corny af his voice is too auto tuned to play at parties people kind of hate it
hiphopheads,not_removed,unfortunately too many people use emojis like that unironically
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a pretty big yachty fan and i didnt like the whole tape but idk up next dipset and for hot stood out the most for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,but hes the king of the teens so i think a bunch of teenagers playing his music shit ton on apple music is exactly what he wants
hiphopheads,not_removed,are teenagers suddenly not people also one of them isnt a feature
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres also a wave of other rappers on soundcloud trying to pick up his style using video game or lullaby like trap beats shout out to burberry perry and yachty bringing something original around
hiphopheads,not_removed,i found that i preferred the slower songs like pretty at ease and so many people i fuck with the whole tape those just my favorites
hiphopheads,not_removed,offset went off in dipset edit since im on the topic of rappers going off i cant not talk about g herbo in up next
hiphopheads,not_removed,him being the king of teens is fucking bullshit hes not the most popular rapper among any age group lmfao
hiphopheads,not_removed,im glad hes getting what he wants but hes not even close to the hottest rapper out there which is the point i was initially making
hiphopheads,not_removed,im just saying that apple music plays arent necessarily the most accurate way to track the hottest artists in the industry its heavily skewed towards the and audiences who wont go out and buy records
hiphopheads,not_removed,they arent the first to do this though they popularized it for sure but ive been hearing stuff like this since around
hiphopheads,not_removed,records sold is quickly becoming an outdated way to measure how hot somebody is thats no longer necessarily artists main goals
hiphopheads,not_removed,you mean the current primary consumers of music if hard sales were an indicator of popularity john mellencamp would be the hottest rapper in the game
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre ignoring the fact that streams earn cents on the dollar compared to album sales hes definitely up and coming but hes not there yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,earning doesnt equal popularity chance debuted in the top ten of the billboard from his streams on apple music alone not only are streams an indicator of popularity but apple music is one of the most reliable
hiphopheads,not_removed,chance was also very high up on the apple music charts not
hiphopheads,not_removed,broccoli was four literally the day before major key dropped now that is occupying the top eight spots while the rest is dispersed all across down to like thirty
hiphopheads,not_removed,did dj shadow have a hand in this
hiphopheads,not_removed,god damn what is with all these late ass motherfuckers in this sub everyone always races to be first for karma if its been out for more than minutes youre not gonna be first to post something let alone hours

hiphopheads,not_removed,im a bot if you have any suggestions you can message my creator here
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love the dude but nah i think hell go down as a cult classic artists thatll influence a generation of underground rappers but he never realized enough mainstream success to be that close to top
hiphopheads,not_removed,top
hiphopheads,not_removed,absolutely not
hiphopheads,not_removed,there are too many great rappers in the four decades or so that hip hop has existed and danny browns body of work is still lacking at this point so no
hiphopheads,not_removed,nope
hiphopheads,not_removed,what type of a question is this are you danny brown hes barely top rappers of his class let alone of all time
hiphopheads,not_removed,some would be lying
hiphopheads,not_removed,he is a phenomenal rapper but imo for someone to be considered a great they need to have influenced the genre in a meaningful way in the case of danny i think his fan base is too narrow to really have the influence that he would have if he wasnt so niche
hiphopheads,not_removed,body of work isnt extensive enough to make a definitive top list
hiphopheads,not_removed,serious question how much do you think the answer matters and why
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre kidding yourself if you think hes not top of the dudes from hes definitely in the top him tde asap rocky raider klan odd future taylor gang chainz his career as chainz not tity boi future and pro erabeast coast fbzunderachievers would be my top from that time period i dont see who could possibly top them
hiphopheads,not_removed,how the fuck isnt it hes been making music forever just because you didnt listen to his old shit doesnt mean it doesnt exist i wouldnt put him top maybe top but youre ridiculous saying he doesnt have an extensive body of work hes got probably mixtapes and a couple of great albums too all detroit state of mind black and brown and the hybrid are all extremely great mixtapes seriously if youve never listened to any of them go check them out people are sleeping on that shit i honestly prefer it to his postold music hes got a shit ton of features and singles the dudes been rapping and releasing shit since or maybe earlier
hiphopheads,not_removed,you dont fw young money
hiphopheads,not_removed,hybrid was great hes got a lot of dope music but is it dope enough to put him into top category he doesnt have enough top music not just music in general you reading i like that but i need you to read in between the lines
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil wayne is way closer to goat status than danny brown what type of shit are you on
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love danny brown and atrocity exhibition was my number two album last year but wayne is a top ten or close to it artist even if he fell off hes still a legend and danny is somewhere in the top probably not even worth comparing the two honestly
hiphopheads,not_removed,he ranks pretty highly on my list primarily because there just arent rappers i find that great or impactful dannys got about very distinct eras in his career of which are just plain extraordinary pre xxx xxx then post xxx pre xxx danny was broke you almost never hear rappers this descriptive and spot on about being as broke as he purported himself to be and disturbed by his youth but was so ghetto fabulous that you couldnt help but love him he had beats bars amd uniquely grungy narratives that really pulled me in deep hot soup and earlier projects were soulful with a gangster rap appeal sometimes i wonder where hed have gone if he kept that edge a bit longer the dilla beats from the dsom series were the icing on the cake cause i had never heard most of them and danny ripped just about all of them he also did good work on some of the stray instrumentals found in that series too he didnt seem to find himself until the hybrid where he gave in to his desire to be himself without many compromises he was this hilarious and loony pimpgangsterdrug dealer with a crazy sharp pen game xxx was danny at his best imo he pushed his content into a mature yet personal realm that many rappers would give a nut to achieve everything about this project was brilliant and here is where he separated himself from being just another detroit dude with bars to a rap star of the highest order i knew he and skywlkr were special together but damn did they ever mesh for this album this guy talked the biggest shit and rocked some mean flows over beats that only a mother could love on first listen imo any artist would struggle to match or surpass xxx i dont hear very many albums that hit on all levels quite like that one and so when i listen to later stuff id rather have xxx instead the new stuff isnt bad it just seems like hes completed his metamorphosis as an artist and completely outgrown my simple tastes that being said danny will go down as a top mc in my opinion also to be noted dude is a dying breed of quintessential mcs who can write great metaphors strictly about how nice they are at rapping imo you cant be a great mc without this trait
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn it i knew i was leaving out something preciate it lol lil wayne and them were tearing shit up i still play no worries to this day
hiphopheads,not_removed,no like i said honestly i wouldnt put him in the top at all but lack of material wouldnt be a valid reason for that biggie has like of the material danny brown has but hes considered a goat i agree with you he doesnt have enough perfect quality music to be top that was basically the point i was trying to make if every tape hes released was all on the same level then he would probably be in that conversation but a few of them are less consistent i think he could be top or top at his current level but if everything hed made was as good as xxx or the dsom series he would be a lot higher
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah this is really no debate at all even though i really like danny brown wayne is a legitimate top or even top of all time danny is more of a top unless he drops another xxx level album and maybe some mixtapes in a few years
hiphopheads,not_removed,for real man i love that old shit its so grimy and visceral i cant remember the best lines off the top of my head but a good one i do remember was used boiled buckets of water to take a bath like god damn man the dude was on some next level shit he just never got enough attention his punchlines and wordplay was insane even back then and some of those beats good god man browntown was another slept on tape that was really dope check out boomerang and do yo homework and this shit is so hard still like if anybody else made this its an instant classic same with this man these shits are so fucking real idk if you ever struggled this shit just hits you if you havent its hard to know where im coming from httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpbmkbunyoek and dont even get me started on black and brown
hiphopheads,not_removed,hell yea dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,you a clown
hiphopheads,not_removed,how much wayne have you listened to i wont deny he has fallen off hard i havent liked much since tha carter but everything before that was so on point especially his mixtapes he was dropping so many tapes and going in on all of them id honestly check datpiff daily cuz ya never know when a new tape would just randomly drop it was quantity and quality many times he would take beats from already popular songs at the time and just murder the original for those years at his peak he was definitely arguable goat i could suggest tapes but theres at least one or two wayne guides on here that go in depth if you use the search function you can also see what other rappers have said about him theres a lot of good to say about him in his prime he was very influental to a lot of artists coming up now who grew up hearing him sorry about the block of text im on mobile
hiphopheads,not_removed,while were on that topic rich as fuck gunwalk love me and she will are some modern classic
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey im op and biased to opinions that dont exactly align with mine lil wayne isnt a top fifty rapper all time because he isnt cerebral enough for me no it doesnt matter the only weezy song ive ever heard is pussy monster
hiphopheads,not_removed,yoo for sure mr carter
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao thats a given
hiphopheads,not_removed,god damn it
hiphopheads,not_removed,the making hip hop subreddit cares about us way more than these people just a heads up
hiphopheads,not_removed,everything sounds stocky and crisp i know youre aiming for an acoustic sound so maybe try sampling some really organic funksoul be sure to trim off the fat of your track before you export if you think something is slightly repetitive it is more than likely very repetitive look up how to eq and mix your sounds before export presentation is also key try to go for a less corny titlepicture i suggest ripping vibe and aesthetic pictures from tumblr and using those also check out rdrumkits your drums are tacky as of right now thats all i can come up with off the top of my head if you have any questions feel free to ask me or anyone over at rmakinghiphop keep practicing bro everyday you learn something new
hiphopheads,not_removed,ugh
hiphopheads,not_removed,if that show wasnt so awful i would have watched it
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i like vic so i tuned in never seen it before though it was rough there was about a minute monologue by some girl railing on kanye for the famous video then they had a panel discussion with vic about the bet awards and jesse williams speech vic literally talked for about a minute and the discussion basically came down to white people shouldnt be able to enjoy black culture fucking awful
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait was vic agreeing with that conclusion
hiphopheads,not_removed,from what i recall basically he no doubt didnt disagree they were talking about how justin timberlake praised the speech on twitter but then got accused of appropriating black culture then vic basically said thats fine but he hasnt done anything for the black community and he no doubt has benefited and profited from taking our culture looking at his twitter i dont see any blacklivesmatter or prayfororandlo tweets then willmore posed a question like what about young white kids who are growing up in this culture and the girl on the panel basically said when they take our culture though do take all the negative things associated with being black like the job discriminationetc then i heard vic say something like exactly
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk i think vic made his points before the conversation slipped into white people have no place in black culture whatsoever and i think he was focusing more on the elvises of modern music as opposed to the white kid that listens to hip hop and appreciated its messages and cultural references not to be confused with the kid that laughs at as opposed to with black culture
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt watch it but i really hope youre right i love vics music but i just cant support some of the things he says like he just came out with the song free love which would make you think he supports all types of love and all people but then on the other hand he has lines like fuck a black cop too thats the same fight you got a badge bitch but you still aint white or something to that effect i get that its a fuck the police type of thing but the whole antiwhite thing is something i cant defend i like that his songs have real meaning that relates to whats going on but damn
hiphopheads,not_removed,perfect album as the weather gets a bit cooler and chillier
hiphopheads,not_removed,this album is mean as fuck watched his interview on the breakfast club today his character combined with his rap skills and his nas cosign will get this dude really far
hiphopheads,not_removed,hoooly shit that intro is nuts gonna buy it right nowthe stream isnt doing enough

hiphopheads,not_removed,dave east stays consistent on the bars autotune rapper have gotten so repetitive and boring recently good to see something different scratch the mainstream surface
hiphopheads,not_removed,been waiting for this for a good minute honestly so solid the whole way through not a bad song on this one for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,so many great tracks on this one and they got cam on it so its a certified great new york album
hiphopheads,not_removed,man even if this is ass i still get a new cam feature
hiphopheads,not_removed,the album is fucking dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,bad boy on death row isnt on spotify in canada for some reasoni wonder if its a mass appeal thing the sickness from jdillas album was left of the canadian spotify release too
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait is the background track on type of time an unreleased track either that and dave east track or a track with ferg sounds a lot more like ferg
hiphopheads,not_removed,ft camron fuck ya not even at that track yet and im already stoked
hiphopheads,not_removed,said it before ill say it again dave east is the best from this freshmen class
hiphopheads,not_removed,i honestly admit ive slept on dave east for so long his name popped up here and there and i just ignored him until i heard his verse on dj dramas body for my zipcode the aggression was so profound and if you havent heard it yet please do hiphop is most definitely not dead yet not with cats like this still coming up
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is pretty good all the songs have a purpose and a meaning and i dislike none of them the only one i wasnt feeling was eyes on me because of the hook i gotta say that this might be top a hip hop albums of the year for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,best rapper on xxl freshman this year by far
hiphopheads,not_removed,beats and hooks kinda generic but bars on point
hiphopheads,not_removed,what is this similar too idk if i should check it out or not
hiphopheads,not_removed,great album love the old sound from a new cat
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love his flowhis adlibs make me laugh tho

hiphopheads,not_removed,this album is what i needed going into this fall season
hiphopheads,not_removed,does anyone know the sample song to eyes on me
hiphopheads,not_removed,the hooks on this are so good
hiphopheads,not_removed,not here in socalmore specifically in and around the san fernando valley

hiphopheads,not_removed,anytime bro gotta let the kids eat
hiphopheads,not_removed,i remember when he was a new artist putting mixtapes on datpiff good shit loved the sde track
hiphopheads,not_removed,denzel curry tho dave is sick but idk if i can say hes definitely better than curry
hiphopheads,not_removed,denzel
hiphopheads,not_removed,agressive hardcore lyrical ny stuff
hiphopheads,not_removed,just check it out
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really like this album but i wouldnt say it is the best out of the last two years
hiphopheads,not_removed,shorty by donell jones
hiphopheads,not_removed,somebody call the wambulence
hiphopheads,not_removed,tell me about it shit was in van nuys a few days ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,aye sfv hhh stand up
hiphopheads,not_removed,one time for van nuys
hiphopheads,not_removed,it aint gonna get consistently cold around here until like midnovember
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wish it was getting warmer where im at funny how everyone hates their weather
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks for the insight appreciate it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like it its a solid start the first bars are the hardest to write and the hardest to share most people cant do what youve already done it takes a strong person to put themselves out there like that good on you
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah this dope good start
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe drop the i in the so thickened the plot line i think it flows better with the setup from before
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love that you like it man it really puts me in that better mind state just by looking at this comment you are really driving me towards my direction because i feel completely lost inside of the belly of the beast and it sometimes can be difficult finding the correct direction in life when the people who are around me coworkers family dont see things the same way that i do
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks for the feedback bud youre right it can be read wrong sometimes it really depends on the type of instrumental that is playing and how you flow with it
hiphopheads,not_removed,this needs to be viewed
hiphopheads,not_removed,frank is that you
hiphopheads,not_removed,op is the most hurt
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok esto esta bien firme
hiphopheads,not_removed,good thing is i never need spotify to play pink matter because if you open hhh on any given day its on the front page
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe someone wants to have a discussion about one of their favorite frank songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok esto esta bien firme
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit my dick out
hiphopheads,not_removed,op were going through these difficult times together theres no need for anger
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok dis hopsin
hiphopheads,not_removed,mods sticky this
hiphopheads,not_removed,elote
hiphopheads,not_removed,guys i just comment for sum karma can i has
hiphopheads,not_removed,pero que chingón
hiphopheads,not_removed,a search shows pink matter was last posted months ago lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,its what harambe would have wanted
hiphopheads,not_removed,no está pasando familia
hiphopheads,not_removed,i see it almost on a weekly basis keep in mind that the mods probably remove it a lot
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know about other people but i feel like its a pretty big waste to spend money on a single song no matter how much i like the artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,why i should buy a song thats on the album i want to buy
hiphopheads,not_removed,title kinda misleading i felt like everyone liked it sonically the title implies it received backlash for the song not the lack of sales
hiphopheads,not_removed,even though dudes like raxstar and bohemia are based outta the west its crazy how much more theyve influenced india rather than here you actually got quality spitters like sikander kahlon and pam ramgharia coming outta punjab im excited for whats to come from there canada connection is big too fateh been putting these guys on
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah the best punjabi artists are honestly from canada america and england lol though i guess thats subjective because they add an americanish twist to thier music which makes us appreciate it more but even looking at guys like mickey singh and prophec theyre way better than the typical punjabi artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol just checked out this sikander kahlon guy his video for the ouuu remix kills me
hiphopheads,not_removed,man this aint even a funny shitpost
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would make a joke but i honestly dont think its appropriate right now my thoughts go out to those affected by this
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is insanity why do people do these things hopefully theres a followup story and the shooter gets what he deserves
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is reportedly video of the shooting if that pop is a gunshot there is only that i hear
hiphopheads,not_removed,heres a vid
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck guns fuck people with guns
hiphopheads,not_removed,did his rollie make it out tho edit downvote me all you want bitches yall wont ever cop that sapphire rollie
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn man rip
hiphopheads,not_removed,breaking multiple ls taken at meek mill concert
hiphopheads,not_removed,what joke would you have made i cant see any immediately obvious jokes about this its just sad
hiphopheads,not_removed,those people shot doin alot better than ronda rn
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant be the only gunshot if two were killed and multiple others were wounded
hiphopheads,not_removed,could be more shooting afterwards though
hiphopheads,not_removed,not funny
hiphopheads,not_removed,douche
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not that guy but something about drake stans being shooters but that joke would be like months too late
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw some guy make a joke about taking ls within minutes of this being posted initially so i was sort of referencing that the comment got downvoted by crazy by now thankfully and i think its below the threshold
hiphopheads,not_removed,relevant username
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant imagine any fan base less likely to be comprised of shooters than drake he has the same fanbase as rihanna for fucks sake
hiphopheads,not_removed,his career is a different story but its not appropriate to bring out memes when people get killed man
hiphopheads,not_removed,rihannas fan base is much harder than drakes
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres a significant overlap as im sure youll agree
hiphopheads,not_removed,just take a look at wikipedia and take a look singularly at the release from from paak to yeezy to bj the chicago kid to drake to chance to noname to schoolboy to frank to dram to tribe to weeknd to bino and thats just name a couple artists to keep it short theres a lot of projects im missing
hiphopheads,not_removed,i havent been listening to much hip hop recently but here is a playlist of some of my favorites here is one with an east coast vibe ive listened to this playlist a lot here is a history of hip hop playlist i made based on mixes made by djs dj mixes httpwwwitstherubcomcategoryhistoryofhiphop
hiphopheads,not_removed,this belongs in the daily discussion thread that we have every day at a random time so this will probably be removed soon but check out the favorites list in the sidebar its a good place to start and always check out projects of artists that you get your attention caught by in features and things
hiphopheads,not_removed,made this awhile ago dont usually use spotify but heres some music i think you would be interested in
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit awesome thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,hustle link pls
hiphopheads,not_removed,rip james damn
hiphopheads,not_removed,joey purp looking like a bizarro school boy q lol﻿
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw that youtube comment you aint slick
hiphopheads,not_removed,quavo most dominant personality best adlibs etc offset close though slick with the flows takeoff
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk why takeoff doesnt get much love i understand he hasnt really done any solo features but gahdam he got one of the nastiest flows in the game for an example check out commando by migos
hiphopheads,not_removed,quavo quavo quavo
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think quavo is the best but id say i like takeoff and offset equally quavo reminds me a lot of max b in a weird way i think a track with both of them one day would be crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,quavo and offset are great they are good in their own ways takeoff i dont know about takeoff
hiphopheads,not_removed,offset good mix of lyrics relative anyways and flow he usually brings songs up quavo hook master but as great as they are there has to be substance to a song which is why i put offset first takeoff flow hes the least popular of the but once in awhile hell get a verse like on thats too good to forget about
hiphopheads,not_removed,takeoff would be my favorite but his voice is so grating sounds like hes been smoking for years
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like this is the most common opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,frfr his features are what got me listening to gos
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to deadz again
hiphopheads,not_removed,he probably has
hiphopheads,not_removed,hannah montana
hiphopheads,not_removed,new ringtone at seconds in
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think this has good radio potential
hiphopheads,not_removed,why does every dj mustard beat somehow sound the same
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is awesome i know every dj mustard beat sounds a lot alike but it works with him and yg but everything works so well here
hiphopheads,not_removed,that yg henneb line tho lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,thugga thugga baby i can put you in some chains like a slave bihh jeffery is the greatest
hiphopheads,not_removed,i never knew how badly i needed this collab
hiphopheads,not_removed,this sounds just like lifestyle forreal play the tracks back and forth and it sounds the really similar
hiphopheads,not_removed,i got so excited thinking this was thatwe gon have a party tonight song still good though
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow loving this these guys are actually great together kind of opposite voices
hiphopheads,not_removed,hennabee
hiphopheads,not_removed,is there a soundcloud link couldnt find it myself
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao definitely making a text tone out of this edit if anyone wants it
hiphopheads,not_removed,every time young thug has a catchy banger we all hope its gonna be a radio hit but it never really takes off i was disappointed when with them didnt really get much mainstream success
hiphopheads,not_removed,i might be wrong but i think thats what drake meant when he said i just found my tempo like im dj mustard
hiphopheads,not_removed,because its always the same tempo he always uses the same clapsnap he always has the same hey chant in the background and most of his beats have a standout bassline as the main instrument and the melody starts in triplets pretty often this song paranoid dont hurt me be real he also likes bells that being said he does have beats that dont have this typical dj mustard feel right from the beginning on saved or nah up down same day but even then there are some easy tells to identify him as the producer his popularity got to a point that this triplet bassline kinda thing got out of hand and many producers copy this certain style its unreal how many beats start with the paranoid melody or the im up melody which was produced by nic nac afaik who is dj mustard now im not sure if paranoiddj mustard actually started the trend of this certain melody im up was certainly not the first song to have its particular melody but its ridiculous how many basic bitch bay area party songs use this exact melody or a variation of it
hiphopheads,not_removed,he has a signature sound bay area style and it works for him so he sticks to it i guess
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant agree that this beat is typical mustard beat new leads new sounds absence of often chants make me think its somebodys else beat
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah yg is hard as fuck on mustard beats hes hard on other styles too but i hope they never stop working together
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn i hear it too now lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,hoe
hiphopheads,not_removed,appreciate it bro i made a text tone with the its lit travis scott ad lib but ive been looking to switch it up
hiphopheads,not_removed,because it would be she on that on the plane and i just called her airhead or cop a chopper end up flipping yeah you better start tripping i dont use words when i a
hiphopheads,not_removed,i still think with that slaps the hardest ive ever heard from a pure get hype standpoint edit misread with them but my point about with that stands shit slaps
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought that was the one too
hiphopheads,not_removed,the label is allergic to pushing young thug songs to the radio properly
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty much its more so that mustard uses the same bpm i want to say its like on all of his tracks but thats part of them sounding the same
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to the album dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,funny thing is it was actually kanye who said that like in facts
hiphopheads,not_removed,but for me its kind of breaking
hiphopheads,not_removed,no doubt man i think i liked mkl better than still brazy just because of how well mustard and yg work together
hiphopheads,not_removed,yooooooo im gonna need that tone
hiphopheads,not_removed,but they played best friend a bunch and he says eat that booty just like groceries
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love bad thats my problem and ya i like to i got a problem edit im not trying to argue that will hold back radio play i am just stating how much enjoyment i get out of listening to the radio edit of fuckin problems
hiphopheads,not_removed,lets not forget fuck up some commas was a huge commercial hit for future and thats pretty expletive heavy i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah that still gets me hype as shit after about listens
hiphopheads,not_removed,bpm
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah he said something like i spit grey poupon on a dj mustard
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah but you are not the general audience if the numbers isnt going down why change it
hiphopheads,not_removed,here you go theres cause of em were shitty so i decided to use another song for the adlib
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was already radio tested with posed to be
hiphopheads,not_removed,we all eat booty even my two kids
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant stand listening to fucking problems on the radio its a great song but damn its not made to be censored like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wish more artists would make substitute different words for the radio version like for that part schoolboy says all my women independent women or with the thang off set makes it more enjoyable than just all my independent like future couldve easily made a radio edit with mess up some commas yeah
hiphopheads,not_removed,nice work
hiphopheads,not_removed,that video where drake comes out at a section boyz show is so hype nice to see them returning the favor
hiphopheads,not_removed,also young thug opened for him what a stage for all of them though im really happy for giggs in particular
hiphopheads,not_removed,i went to this show last night and it was fucking lit that new tune he has with giggs fucking slaps 🔥🙏🏽
hiphopheads,not_removed,no afghan dan
hiphopheads,not_removed,looks like trav might be making an appearance as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,is drake still a culturevulture when he shows love to the city by bringing out these special guests on his shows
hiphopheads,not_removed,great look for all involved although section boyz look incredibly uncomfortable on that stage lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was weird to hear lock arff performed all hyped like that part of why i love the song is how cold the laid back delivery sounds on the record
hiphopheads,not_removed,the nigga almost tripped on the song with giggs
hiphopheads,not_removed,rip any hope of atmosphere at drake shows i went to the club paradise show and it was fucking amazing the energy felt just perfect but wylat some years later felt like fucking teenybopper chart fans everywhere who only went to see hold on were going home and underage drink smirnoff ices and puke i literally left before the final songs it felt awkward being at that show i have got tickets to the upcoming eu shows but im not epxecting much look at how the crowd is ded for of their own citys acts in giggs and section boyz
hiphopheads,not_removed,got me so hype i felt like i was there
hiphopheads,not_removed,i never heard of giggs but that more life track sounds so good
hiphopheads,not_removed,how you gonna miss the goat eminem
hiphopheads,not_removed,turns on livestream of drakes next concert
hiphopheads,not_removed,i rate drake so much for this move a lot of the crowd that see drake at a stadium have no idea who section boys and giggs are so drake had no need to bring these guys out he did it because he respects the culture and the music we have here in london cant believe i saw section boys at the fucking
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,of course bro didnt anybody tell you that drake only brings these people out so he can stay relevant he neeeeds to ride their waves to maintain any fan base
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty much
hiphopheads,not_removed,they barely make any bangers anymore and everyone knows lock arff
hiphopheads,not_removed,soundslike the perfect crowd to pop some cherries that night just say u
hiphopheads,not_removed,giggs is a legend really worth listening to his song talkin the hardest should be the english national anthem
hiphopheads,not_removed,his album landlord is on spotify its worth a listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to let em ave it or his first one they are much better than landlord
hiphopheads,not_removed,im going with a female friend but swear its probably a kiddy fiddlying paradise
hiphopheads,not_removed,its actually mad how i used to walk home from school listening to taking da hardest on my sony erikson now hes on a song with drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,i disagree
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a damn good project for throwaways but there are plenty of albums that had a lot of planning and execution this year that are contenders for project of the year
hiphopheads,not_removed,this may just be me but i really havent listened to it since it dropped it never made my rotation
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would say tribes album was much better
hiphopheads,not_removed,i listened to number and like and never revisited
hiphopheads,not_removed,didnt even know he was locked up
hiphopheads,not_removed,everready the religion or all
hiphopheads,not_removed,big bs red sox
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn you just cant deny thugs incredible ability to take a song that starts off pretty good and turn it into complete trash the second he hops on the mic
hiphopheads,not_removed,i get money to kill time dead clocks
hiphopheads,not_removed,removed use the search bar mane
hiphopheads,not_removed,one of my favourite songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,gibbs flow is just impeccable love me some old gibbs to start the day off
hiphopheads,not_removed,check out da vid
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty clear it was going to be on the album since its the lead single
hiphopheads,not_removed,of this list is from major key you need to listen to more music
hiphopheads,not_removed,this list is fucking awful number is an entire verse
hiphopheads,not_removed,where is travis scott for stroke my cactus
hiphopheads,not_removed,needs way more variety
hiphopheads,not_removed,they didnt have it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont give a shit about trinidad james but i give lots of shits about chuck inglish
hiphopheads,not_removed,james is underappreciated tho he puts in work glad to see them both together cant wait to new cool kids too
hiphopheads,not_removed,personally i think hes garbage
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was an extremely negative review for a
hiphopheads,not_removed,while too long i thought this was a better pop weeknd album than bbtm his last album had a handful of stand out songs but really failed as a pop album starboy has less true high points in dark weeknd fashion but really made the pop side work a lot better imo and has a much more consistent style bbtm was so inconsistent i couldnt ever give it a full listen thru whereas i find myself letting starboy drift on past the song i go to listen to even if some are forgettable maybe i just had lowerdifferent expectations this time but i was pleasantly surprised i mean i think they couldve cut songs and then had something much more solid but tbh as it is i dont think its as objectively bad as a lot of yall are making it out to be i do think they have a point that the lyricism was rather uninspireddirectionless quite a bit i would like to see him improve on that some the conceit of reminder contrasting his mainstream popularity with his darker lifestyleimage was pretty clever and shouldve been more effectively carried throughout the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i looked at the score hm i thought it was way worse read the review my thoughts exactly i think its a pretty good review im not gonna go ahead and quote the whole thing but i think it pretty well articulates my problems with the record
hiphopheads,not_removed,i liked starboy but it definitely did not need to be tracks i think the album could have been dramatically improved if it cut about tracks from it and spent more development with the remaining tracks
hiphopheads,not_removed,im shocked that everyone hated this album so much what were you guys expecting its a huge step up from bbtm and has so many really great songs i feel it coming sidewalks party monster starboy reminder false alarm true colors etc it wasnt generic aside from maybe love to lay and nothing without you and it really showcased a great new mixture of mainstream weeknd and creative weeknd i think a lot of you set yourselves up for failure by expecting too much from this album its everything i thought it was going to be
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope the mixed reviews inspire abel to come up with new things to sing about
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know why they angled the piece to be about his loss of identity because i felt that he finally found himself on starboy him having party monster and die for you on the same album doesnt seem like a contradiction to me at all im completely fine with him mixing up ballads and drugged out sex with random girls the author mentions that shes upset that its not a single mood or overarching persona on this album but i liked that because human beings are walking contradictions not monolithic personalities that always feel the same way he can say hes willing to die for a girl on die for you and still feel guilty about almost killing another girl giving him roadhead on ordinary life he can be pissed at a girl for just fucking everyone and never wanting to have a relationship with him false alarm and still make a song about loving that hes fucking another girl without the need to put a label on it rockin real people feel all of these ranges of emotions and philosophies so he included all of them on the album it felt like i finally got to meet the actual weeknd on this album which i enjoyed because the whole mysterious sex monster gimmick was getting old that comment about rockin being designed for office party karaoke was amazingly accurate though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think the hes the next michael jackson spiel should just retire already if anything this album proved how by the numbers and replaceable he is give this album to bryson tillerjeremih or miguel to sing and it wouldnt have been much different
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow last time i agreed with a pitchfork review this hard was channel orange even tho thats a should be lower points to reflect the article but thats just semantics
hiphopheads,not_removed,good review but i cant help but feel critics are placing starboy below bbtm because it doesnt have the smash hits starboy is simply a better listen all the way through filler yes but some of the transitions are more trilogyesque than the previous record period
hiphopheads,not_removed,did bruno mars and abel switch places because whatever abel wants to be i think bruno is already there and doing it great on his new album hes prob gonna sell better too dude did a whole on his career and i love it
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre tweaking he sold out big time on bbtm so i dont know how theyre surprised now starboy is sequenced much better although the tracklist couldve been shorter and has an overall consistent sound than the clusterfuck that was bbtm i do wish he went with that trilogy sound and expanded on that next level rb radiohead esque sound but its whatever
hiphopheads,not_removed,love the album i thought bbtm was not good but i am not into pop i thought it had great versatility showing why he is a starboy he can do all genres these rb dudes are doing
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think its a fair view that most people see i think its like a to an and i loved the album i think people are still having trouble seeing that the weeknd is a pop artist and thats how he started out he began as the noise and then went to the weeknd and made hob thursday and eos hes always had the intent of being pop his main idol and influences are prince and mj starboy is him really hitting his stride with his trilogy lyrics and pop sound imo he can still craft his savage lyrics about getting road head and fucking a girl who has her whole crew poppin hes gonna continue on this route and i think his sound is really forming where he can carve himself a name in the industry as an jagged jackson which i feel but cant say for sure is his intent hes been predicting this change and outlast from people since rolling stone when it comes to it were used to his face and his mystery has faded and hes different but deep down he still got us thats what the real weeknd fans need to look out for
hiphopheads,not_removed,interesting review sums up some of my problems and issues regarding the album however as much as i love i feel it coming most reviewers point out that is the best pop song in recent times is it they slammed party monster too its like the hillscant feel my face all over again when it comes to critical reception
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is like a better version of bbtm so no idea how people who loved that tape can say they hate this one if youre a i wish he just stuck to making trilogytype songs then i can understand you not liking this nor bbtm weeknd is starting to step away from the nihilist antisimp loneranger personality with tracks like die for you nothing without you preferring to settle down with the one girl from party monster stargirl so not really contradictory since hes falling in love with the same cokedup feins he usually just kicks out the next morning perhaps his next album will be even less dark and lovedovey hope not describing being in a relationship with this fein all in all well done abel a solid pop album with some excellent songs on there i just hope he releases mixtapes alongside his pop albums so he can keep both the mainstream and the people who love his old shit sated
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a lot better than beauty behind the madness dumbass pitchfork
hiphopheads,not_removed,are you guys all hearing a different album than i am solid aoty
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope thats out of
hiphopheads,not_removed,busta rhymes has proved that point wholeheartedly
hiphopheads,not_removed,the author doesnt set the score on pitchfork
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre too pussy to give out super negative scores now unless its a bands tenth album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i tend to think of scores like grades in school so in this case the album got a d it didnt fail but its slightly below average
hiphopheads,not_removed,you really think they couldve cut songs thats a bit harsh lol what
hiphopheads,not_removed,my thoughts exactly itd be easier to name songs i dont like i hate false alarm and nothing without you but thats pretty much it starboy is simply just better than bbtm
hiphopheads,not_removed,its best on shuffle not a cohesive album at all i found it very enjoyable its nothing groundbreaking but there are some very catchy songs on there
hiphopheads,not_removed,you should at least finish it though i agree it wasnt anything special
hiphopheads,not_removed,literally listened for lana and kendrick kendricks feature was the only track i really enjoyed but i knew i didnt like the weeknd before anyway so i had my mind made up though i still gave it a shot
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was expecting something more just because of the fact that he in his starboyvideo slay everything about mainstream weeknd with this atleast i was thinking he would give up sales for maybe trying something else or rather something more trilogykiss land which i thought was more his and not influenced by people around him wanting huge sales instead it became an album the bbtmfans could see as out of the box while its merely a rebranded bbtm im not saying youre wrong i guess i just had higher hopes for the weeknd he will probably go on the make good music but i dont think he will change it or battle with the great
hiphopheads,not_removed,i personally liked bbtm better and i was so disappointed in him when i heard bbtm starboy is interesting but its very rough around the edges and has tons of filler and none of the songs live up to the titular single which is quite disappointing imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly i doubt it
hiphopheads,not_removed,starboy will probably be more popular than bbtm so i seriously doubt he cares
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean hes doing pretty well for himself dont know if he cares about reviews
hiphopheads,not_removed,you cant become the next mj by trying to be the next mj he has the potential but needs to be the best him he can be thats not what this album is
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes no where near as charismatic as mj on his tracks imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,more like the next chris brown id say bryson tiller jeremih and miguels albums from last year were all leagues ahead of this thing or bob good mixtapes poppy albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive never listened to a jeremih or miguel album in full but i would not put bryson tiller on the same shelf as the weeknd personally bryson tillers music is so cut and paste and boring
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk i feel like tiller jeremih and miguel all put out overall better music than abel
hiphopheads,not_removed,mehan jayasuriya really hit the nail on the head here his other reviews are pretty spot on as well imo edt mehan is a man oops
hiphopheads,not_removed,the reviewer isnt mad its pop theyre bad its bad read the review beauty behind the madness managed to smuggle sleaze into the mainstream by refining tesfayes pop songcraft even as it doubled down on the darkness starboy eases up on both fronts recycling melodies ideas and even whole songs while presenting a sanitized version of the weeknd that often lacks any real sense of perspective as if to guarantee that it feels like a slog starboy is also overstuffed over an hour of music stretching out over songs many of them bland rockin sounds like a label executives idea of what the weeknd could be inoffensive club pop tailormade for office karaoke parties i just want your body next to mecause it brings me so much ecstasywe can just be rockin yeah false alarm snatches defeat from the jaws of victory its sublime opening harmonies devolving into a screamed chorus thats as contrived as michael jacksons bellow at the beginning of scream six feet under a collaboration with future is essentially just a rewrite of the pairs much sharper low life reminder also recycles the vocal melody from low life both here and on all i know the melodicallygifted rapper feels sorely underutilized kendrick lamars verse on the autotuneheavy sidewalks is characteristically dexterous but even he sounds a bit unenthused to be here its hard to blame him starboy could use a lot more of audacity or really any kind of coherent storytelling that challenges complicates or further illuminates our understanding of the unfeeling villain that tesfaye has been playing since day one instead we get a grab bag of difficult to reconcile contradictions a party monster on one track a doeeyed balladeer on another die for you tesfaye used to be nearobsessive about packaging projects that felt narratively whole—after all this is the guy who released an entire trilogy of interconnected albums in his first year starboy by way of contrast feels more like an opportunistic compilation of bsides than an album who is the weeknd at this point even the man behind the curtain might not know
hiphopheads,not_removed,i keep seeing this opinion saying its a better version of bbtm im not in the mood to argue about it or go through the track list especially because its completely objective but i just wanted to put it out there that i think bbtm is a much better album im a trilogy fan over everything but right now ill take bbtm over starboy i definitely have to live with this album for a while before i can say that for sure but for now it is what it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,bbtm has tell your friends often the hills acquainted and cant feel my face and theyre all right next to each other this album doesnt have any songs that touch those
hiphopheads,not_removed,looks like someone still hasnt listened to the new tribe album
hiphopheads,not_removed,what about saitama checkmate
hiphopheads,not_removed,youd think theyd pick an author with a more fitting review for the score though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like this should be stickied with every review
hiphopheads,not_removed,usually they chose someone whos pitch matches the score theyre going with so not really sure whats going on here its not like they pick one reviewer and the add the score on after the editors know what they want the score to be writers send pitches and they chose one in line with the publication
hiphopheads,not_removed,everyone pretends that this is a fact but nobody has actually back this up with any evidence
hiphopheads,not_removed,or eminems new album where they just talk about how offensive he is for paragraphs
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol just wait till gambino drops friday they have a hard on for giving him super low scores
hiphopheads,not_removed,is like a c in canada
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think theres that are awful or anything but moreso that i think there could be a song particularly tight cut of the album featuring just its strongest tracks that wouldve been significantly better recieved
hiphopheads,not_removed,the songs do blend together pretty well but i agree theres no storyline and its not cohesive so there isnt really a point in listening to it in order i feel it coming is a good ender though imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think he kills off the old character in each project similar thing in bbtm doesnt necessarily mean the mainstream weeknd but the old weeknd
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just think anybody who thinks hes going to all of a sudden not care about making mainstream hits and being successful is crazy of course hes going to still do that he still has a job at the end of the day to make money from all of this and if he can do that well by mixing together mainstream with his own flair then by all means do it i hated bbtm too i thought it was absolute garbage aside from like songs but this album is really great
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think people need to just lay low with all of this trilogy hype you knew this isnt the same guy he was a few years back why hold him in the same sound i enjoyed this album heavily because of the new taste and i was a fan since house of balloons the only people disappointed were the ones expecting trilogy imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,is starboy going to be to rhiphopheads what tame impalas currents is to rindieheads
hiphopheads,not_removed,i honestly dont think it will i cant feel my face and the hills were amazing singles i dont think this album can compete
hiphopheads,not_removed,its sad because i think he has a much higher ceiling more potential then those guys as much as i like most of them but hes so wrapped up in trying to be michael jackson that hes becoming less interesting through studio albums the mixtapes played to his strengths and still had that mysterious angle to them but now hes basically throwing random interesting sounds for songs on each album and making the rest different versions of the same song
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruno mars shit was leagues ahead of this lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,i couldnt really get into trapsoul and can completely agree with that late nights jeremih and wildheart miguel are great albums though
hiphopheads,not_removed,cmon theres no way you can say that about tiller but the other are arguable
hiphopheads,not_removed,im pretty sure its a sri lankan dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i definitely enjoyed her prima donna review for sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres a solid tracks on this album i think are amazing tbf
hiphopheads,not_removed,are we forgetting in the night and prisoner those are honestly great too
hiphopheads,not_removed,this album doesnt have any songs that touch those i feel it coming starboy secrets reminder sidewalks a lonely night i can go on tbh bbtm sounds like a collection of singles with the rest of the album being generic pop bsides made for radio it was a slap in the face to long time fans starboy is at least consistent all the way through and has some of his most interesting songs since trilogy
hiphopheads,not_removed,the whole second half of the album is absolute generic garbage that sounds like any other pop artist and this album has i feel it coming sidewalks starboy reminder party monster true colors false alarm die for you etc that are all just as good as those some even better
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant feel my face is the worst song hes ever made he remade that song with rockin here they both suck
hiphopheads,not_removed,tribe
hiphopheads,not_removed,he didnt cut it though it fell out due to his intense training small price to pay to be a fucking badass
hiphopheads,not_removed,this fucking subreddit is so weird from busta to anime in a split second lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,atheists
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah hell get a to
hiphopheads,not_removed,im calling it now he wont get less than
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wouldnt count on it they give him low scores cause his music usually warrants it this project looks like itll be different
hiphopheads,not_removed,it sounds right up their alley so far i think theyll cream themselves over it
hiphopheads,not_removed,was it bad i didnt listen to that stream of it the tracks that have come out though have been good
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre obviously going to give it a
hiphopheads,not_removed,those are reissues or looking back scores to already agreed upon as classic albums im talking about them only have the balls to pan albums from weezer green day or muse
hiphopheads,not_removed,so are you guys dumber or smarter because where im from is no questions asked failing
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really think this sub is somewhat elitist when it comes to artists like the weeknd drake etc i get its not super artsy and original like the beloved anderson paak or frank ocean but it has a nice sound to it and you can play it around your friends without making them leave
hiphopheads,not_removed,my big problem with this is that he doesnt seem to actually change anything he kills off the old weeknd but he keeps making music that isnt too distinctively different from previous releases
hiphopheads,not_removed,which means what
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes got low mein thats all u need
hiphopheads,not_removed,isnt he in a committed relationship
hiphopheads,not_removed,even bruno mars magic got polarizing reviews
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh trapsoul was better than this
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre right
hiphopheads,not_removed,same i really like sidewalks and reminder a lot been on repeat idc he recycled flows the rest is decent enough to just leave on shuffle
hiphopheads,not_removed,only of those are good tho and none are as good as tell your friends or the hills
hiphopheads,not_removed,all great songs id even throw in party monster false alarm stargirl interlude and ordinary life as tracks i really dig
hiphopheads,not_removed,true colors sounds like a bryson tiller track if tiller suddenly got really bad at songwriting
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol worst song hes ever made happens to be one of the most popular
hiphopheads,not_removed,except i actually remember cant feel my face and rockin is forgettable as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,i will never forgive
hiphopheads,not_removed,will be higher than binos new album
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao this is gonna be a shitstorm
hiphopheads,not_removed,remindme days
hiphopheads,not_removed,bti deserved a
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah camp was not good i havent listened to one song off that since it first dropped everything following blows it out of the water
hiphopheads,not_removed,redbone didnt get bnt and no review for me and your mama have to wonder if theyre dismissing it already just because its bino
hiphopheads,not_removed,which is funny since new weezer album is pretty great
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought the white album not the beatles one review was pretty positive
hiphopheads,not_removed,is a fail here maybe its harder to get higher marks here
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh yeah definitely ive been dating this girl who doesnt like frank but loves this new weeknd album so when im with her thats what i play when im alone its blonde and endless on repeat
hiphopheads,not_removed,my b on the delay i agree this album is similar to bbtm but apart from that kiss land and trilogy were both very different from each other as well as his past two albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,album releases and is extremely successful even among people who werent fans of the artist to begin with that last part probably is not be the case for the weeknd because he was very popular before because the album had a different sound from the artists previous work many of the artists older fans arent thrilled with it these two things together make the community start to circlejerk against the album claiming its overrated by people outside of the community who arent real fans of the artist people outside the circlejerk who like the sound of the new album start a reversecirclejerk against the people who didnt like the album if you dont like the album youre now a contrarian hipster if you do like the album you start all of your comments with this might be an unpopular opinion here but i like this album or knowing this subreddit ill probably get downvoted but i enjoyed their new album you of course then proceed to get highly upvoted for saying you like the album you get downvoted for saying you liked an older album of the artists more at this point your posts will be deleted from the circlejerk sub if they have anything to do with the album the album has achieved meme status new music has come out and people dont care about it anymore
hiphopheads,not_removed,my biggest problems is that when bruno makes songs like uptown funk they have such a short shelf life i get tired of songs like that really quickly and he decided to make an entire album of songs like that while it was a good throwback i really think bruno should stick with a piano
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit was pretty fuego and anthony fantano gave it a therefore it is objectively better than average we just need a pitchfork review to settle it once and for all but it seems like they wont review it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like everyone is so hard on abel because this isnt the triology bbtm is my aoty from that shit was so good i dont understand the hate this album is definitely a step down but there is a solid tracks i fuck with heavy i dont think it deserves anything less than a
hiphopheads,not_removed,it actually sounds almost exactly like a journalsera justin bieber track which took a bunch of influence from rb like ginuwine however i dont see much bryson tiller in that track hes got that dark soul trap thing thats super atmospheric and slow and i really dont see that on here hes more closely influenced by pnd if anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,why is that contradictory to you
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant feel my face and rockin are both focustested dance songs i dont see a difference
hiphopheads,not_removed,tribe album ≠ busta album
hiphopheads,not_removed,so yea like uuum kinda but not really but technically yeah but then again nah but hell yea that shit crazy bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,defaulted to one day i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
hiphopheads,not_removed,that sounds about right to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,pitchfork only like rappers that are crazy or hood man
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know is terrible pretty much anywhere thats saying you literally only know half the material
hiphopheads,not_removed,im in canada and under is a fail here probably different between provinces
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol funnily enough i thought currents was good and its the only tame impala record i listened to did he actually drift that far from his original sound personally trilogy weeknd was the best and he will never top that but if he really wants to be a pop star he needs to focus on making an actual pop album
hiphopheads,not_removed,god i hate that song even worse that it got roty it sounded like songs just smashed together and took a bunch turns in different directions i love though because it has a pretty smooth roll all throughout the song
hiphopheads,not_removed,fantano will give a good rating to anything that is remotely different
hiphopheads,not_removed,its just a ridiculous statement to say its the worst song hes ever made when clearly millions of people enjoy it if you think its trash and you dont want to listen to it thats fine but saying its a bad song is like saying steph curry is a bad basketball player unless of course everyone in the world has awful taste in music except you if thats the case congratulations dude i hope you use your talent of musical opinion to go places
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah but one is written by max martin and the other was written by someone who writes trash pop music also cant feel my face is about cocaine at least
hiphopheads,not_removed,doesnt change the fact that his features were some of the best of the year
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like you havent listened to the tribe album
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh its awful but its a pass here
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree is a lot better but its not what i was looking for from bruno
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not true there are many examples but to stay on the subject of the weeknd house of balloons was very different that got a
hiphopheads,not_removed,dont mean to be rude but i dont think a love song referencing drugs is particularly noteworthy
hiphopheads,not_removed,features yes but a full album not so much
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like you havent listened to back on my bs
hiphopheads,not_removed,isnt not a love song referencing cocaine its a love song addressed to cocaine its better written and more dynamic was my main point
hiphopheads,not_removed,right but no one was talking about a full album
hiphopheads,not_removed,where are we going with this
hiphopheads,not_removed,we were talking about busta falling off
hiphopheads,not_removed,that busta fell off with his album game no info on for like years either
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah and im saying that his quality didnt really decline considering he put out some fire ass features
hiphopheads,not_removed,and im saying it did considering his last few albums its whatever bruh im done

hiphopheads,not_removed,dont bother
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like look at me and imsippinteainyohood i gotta be in a certain mood to listen to him tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to riot by him to hear a different type of song from him tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,am i wrong to say this sounds just like carti
hiphopheads,not_removed,alot of the new rappers sound the same lately but yes he sounds very similar to him in tone of voice but x is more aggressive at times and so are the beats he uses that actually alot of the appeal that he has going for him was that aggressive and angry nature most of the new rappers sound more monotone and lifeless they dont put too much emotion
hiphopheads,not_removed,in my very humble opinion this is kanyes best sample flip ever listen to the httpsyoutubexlyjieevkzc and you can hear how incredible the version ye made turned out to be he turned a slow waltz song into a soaring victory anthem that is also still technically a waltz just an incredible song right here and killas verses fit the mood perfectly this really is the type of shit you just ride out to
hiphopheads,not_removed,in death i will
hiphopheads,not_removed,playlist is dope half of these aint bangers though fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,at datpiff hq theyre probably panicking and cold calling rappers to get some unreleased tape and pass it off as the surprise haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,i want off datpiffs wild ride
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo id actually be more suprised now if they dropped something massive
hiphopheads,not_removed,backtracking so hard sounds like a lil yachty concert
hiphopheads,not_removed,i posted this first bro im triggered plus i followed the rules and made it a text post god damn im so cool
hiphopheads,not_removed,good the other thread is all you nerds bitching about new fab anyway
hiphopheads,not_removed,just got back on reddit to this idk what to think i hope its something else
hiphopheads,not_removed,its clearly beast mode imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,travis x quavo pls
hiphopheads,not_removed,its kendrick and cole im calling it now its been a little over a year since the black friday remixes
hiphopheads,not_removed,its jayden smith guys hes going to reveal how was all a conspiracy
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont really listen to fab anymore and havent really listened to trey songz in over years and i know most of ya dont either but ya living in a vacuum datpiff is a hood mixtape source a fab and trey songz mixtape will get crazy fucking downloads because people in the hood still do really like both of them and a lot of them go to datpiff to get their mixtapes i dont know whether this is the actual release or not but this will do numbers regardless
hiphopheads,not_removed,better not be seriously cant handle trap music
hiphopheads,not_removed,get bino and chance on the phone
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant decipher what youre trying to say
hiphopheads,not_removed,i had the very first and made it a text post and was actually pretty visible at one point but mine was removed too
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol come on lets not act like datpiff wasnt all this is gonna be huge misleading everybody into a fabolous mixtape like dudes good and all but hes not really anything special and worth big hype hes not some amazing artist people fiend for
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love fab but is hes not really major or unexpected there are so many other dudes who are poppin a lot more than fab rn
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh we got innovaters out there in the hood now we slowly but surely learning how to download torrents
hiphopheads,not_removed,what else are you expecting every other possibility is likely a trap tape
hiphopheads,not_removed,then dont listen bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit i wonder if thats it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think theyre saying yachty uses a backing vocal track when he performs i thought most musicians do this
hiphopheads,not_removed,me either lol i just think hes trying to be edgy
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe referring to the song truck loads where he repeats back it up back it up thats a truck
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomhexuciypng
hiphopheads,not_removed,you telling me what fabolous isnt hurts my heart
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes my third favorite rapper of all time but i know no one has a top like mine
hiphopheads,not_removed,fresh beethoven mixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,anything really just want a solid bars artist is all you guys are so uptight
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol better be old chance cuz ion want that gospel shit in my ears
hiphopheads,not_removed,no shitty performers do
hiphopheads,not_removed,go home roger
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes better than trey songz at least
hiphopheads,not_removed,out of curiosity whats your top
hiphopheads,not_removed,that tape has been in the works or production limbo for at least a few years so if it ever gets released it likely is old chance
hiphopheads,not_removed,you havent been to many concerts have you
hiphopheads,not_removed,went to a wale concert once and can confirm
hiphopheads,not_removed,in order tonedeff nas fabolous louis logic young thug my lastfm will back this up
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait so youre saying it actually may exist
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think backing tracks are at least semiunique to hiphop i go to a lot of indiefolkrock shows and i have never heard one of those artists use a backing track
hiphopheads,not_removed,for real everyone uses backing tracks at least occasionally
hiphopheads,not_removed,not many shows with vocal tracks seeing rtj and oddisee with a live band next month they wont have back vocals i dont wanna pay to hear someone rap or sing over their cd
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats one of the stranger top fives ive seen
hiphopheads,not_removed,louis logic now thats a name i havent heard in a while he had a track with celph titled that i used to bump in hs a lot edit it was diablos
hiphopheads,not_removed,something about having tonedeff and fab and young thug in your top is hilarious respect though great artists polymer top
hiphopheads,not_removed,respect man i love the eclectic top most of all
hiphopheads,not_removed,in an ama last year chance said it does exist
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive seen probably like shows with a pretty wide range of artists rappers are the only ones ive heard use backing tracks and even then its not an overwhelming majority
hiphopheads,not_removed,why are you ok with it
hiphopheads,not_removed,most random ive ever seen easily
hiphopheads,not_removed,making backpackers and trap heads mad at the same time
hiphopheads,not_removed,polymer was a legit fucking record i only heard about it a couple of weeks ago but its fucking impressive
hiphopheads,not_removed,sometimes its fine occasionally and used as a breather i dont like when the entire concert is like that tho it comes across as lazy to me like you cant even perform your own music why tf am i here
hiphopheads,not_removed,every concert ive been to has had backing tracks
hiphopheads,not_removed,they all got crazy flows and like to rap about women a lot
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats a very odd criteria
hiphopheads,not_removed,you can tell lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a list of personal favorites its based only how much i like the artist im just pointing out they have some similarities so i dont think its completely random
hiphopheads,not_removed,when the singing rapping is happening and the artist isnt the one doing it like the dj is playing the track straight off itunes it happens a lot for hooks and when the want to get the crowd involved
hiphopheads,not_removed,deadlines are broken all the time ideally when theyre set people would like to deliver and sometimes theyre forced to if its not ready its not ready and in forty years if and when were reminiscing over the album nobody will give a shit that it took two or three extra years to get it out same exact thing with a song of ice and fire fans
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes but he doesnt owe you anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,i get that but why does he have to tease us its fucked up when you have a huge fanbase thats supporting you and anticipating your release and then you give them a bunch of fake release dates its like spitting in his fans faces
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you think it is just frank ocean who is behind the release of his album you are sorely mistaken dozens of people are involved teams of fucking people are involved not to mention a labelslike damn music isnt made in a microwave the best shit comes out of the oven
hiphopheads,not_removed,why are you being such a crybaby its just music get over it
hiphopheads,not_removed,id like to see quavo make a solo project
hiphopheads,not_removed,one step closer to quavo leaving migos like hhh wants
hiphopheads,not_removed,not sure where all this stuff about wanting quavo to leave migos comes from yes hes very versatile and will hope on a lot of features but migos as a group still brings that heat did you seriously not hear way all three spit bars
hiphopheads,not_removed,🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽quavo would literally be my favorite rapper if he does hes so raw
hiphopheads,not_removed,why do people want this migos are one of hhh favortie groups atm offset and takeoff are om quavos level both are better rappers
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think they want him to leave exactly
hiphopheads,not_removed,why the emoji doe that stuff will get you banned fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,hours later and no ban mods either be sleeping or letting you slide haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think people like quavo more because hes more versatile and entertaining he outshines the rest of migos in almost every song imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,foreal i had no idea thanks for the tip off
hiphopheads,not_removed,they prolly read the thread and saw that i didnt know
hiphopheads,not_removed,this discussion happened before but i highly doubt he leaves i dont think many people here know they are related same with rae sremmurd people wanting swae to go solo highly highly doubt it ever happens
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah man offset always has the best bars out of the group
hiphopheads,not_removed,that is so far from the truth man i love quavo and get why he is the one with the most mainstream appeal but takeoff and offset are so damn good and the three of them have amazing chemistry like offset on dipset he kills that feature they all bring something different to the table and to be honset i feel like a solo quavo album would feel really stale compared to migos work
hiphopheads,not_removed,im looking out for the fam its only a day ban but its still kinda annoying
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre not only related but loyal to each other to the point where they would split a third of their earnings and save it for offset while he was in jail i doubt theyll separate but you never know
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah your right thats why i feel like if he went solo it wouldnt be cool with takeoff or offset but quavo just gets a lot more features cuz like you said hes versatile where imo offset and takeoff are more limited to rapping only
hiphopheads,not_removed,offset gets features he was on im up and summer songs for example just quavo gets the more mainstreamrecognized features
hiphopheads,not_removed,takeoff clearly gets the least amount of attention in the group which kinda sucks cause his flow is nice as fuck quavo my fav just cause he got melodies though
hiphopheads,not_removed,ohmangoddamn this is nice i like their synergy gotta say im probably listening to too much dex because he sounds so similar on a lot of his shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,whre dat mirror thoutgh
hiphopheads,not_removed,such a great song and tyo is perfect for it awesome remix
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpwwwvibecaptaincomtracksfamousdexftmadeintyowityobitchremixcdq edit mirror for ctrlf
hiphopheads,not_removed,ariana grande dangerous woman
hiphopheads,not_removed,mattyb real niggas dont die vol is going up at the party fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,anderson paak malibu
hiphopheads,not_removed,hamburger helper mixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,all these haters salty im too seasoned homie
hiphopheads,not_removed,in that scene he also holds his hand to his chin similar to the iconic steve jobs pose i dont think steve jobs was known to be a humble man haha was definitely intentional
hiphopheads,not_removed,ooh i didnt catch that ok that aspect pretty much cemented that theory for me the question for me now is whether its simply done because of the irony with the narrator saying to be humble as you mentioned or if theres something even more to it thats really well hidden at that point im probably reading into it too much tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,my lowkey favorite wiz song mixtape wiz really knows how to kill it sometimes
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh man this used to be the party anthem
hiphopheads,not_removed,wiz khalifa was one of those rappers i enjoyed listening to their mixtapes but got famous and i couldnt stand anymore i still listening his stuff from years ago but after rolling papers i stopped the fame made him seem like a different person
hiphopheads,not_removed,id recommend just going in chronologically order
hiphopheads,not_removed,peoples instictive travels and the path of rythm
hiphopheads,not_removed,my personal favorite is the low end theory its a fun album that doesnt sacrifice the lyricism
hiphopheads,not_removed,save it for the dd also low end theory
hiphopheads,not_removed,start out with the documentary maybe other that id say listen to bonita applebum first
hiphopheads,not_removed,do people not just do this by default i mean yeah most have already heard r know of bonita applebum award tour scenario etc but why listen to an artists pinnacle achievement and then have everything go downhill relatively from there
hiphopheads,not_removed,starting with i left my wallet in el sugundo
hiphopheads,not_removed,soulo sounding gooood really hoping the wait has been worth it
hiphopheads,not_removed,deleted
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is pretty dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,big quint seems like hes interviewing for a job hes not qualified for
hiphopheads,not_removed,the skype call was like a war between hairlines
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like im one of the few who loves down
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a regular anthony fantano styled review it isnt a first reaction video bigquint will still release his on his channel
hiphopheads,not_removed,so annoying how for every two words fantano says quint goes umhmm and yep yep way fucking louder i could barely hear the man let him talk goddamn
hiphopheads,not_removed,one thing im kinda surprised neither touched on was how catchy some of these hooks are ive listened to all rtj albums and for me this has some of the most infectious hooks i was shopping today and repeatedly mumbling lililililive from the garden live from the garden run the jewels live from the garden and thats just one tracks like call ticketron stay gold and panther like a panther have super good hooks this very likely is my fav rtj album and it might be just because its the first one ive listened to new but if i could say one thing that stuck out it was how well elp and mike have mastered their flow and hooks their flow like at the beginning of legend has it is crazy af and elp brought his a game on beats too
hiphopheads,not_removed,its my favorite of the three but meow the jewels is still the best right quint
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao someone said theyre the run the jewels of music reviews
hiphopheads,not_removed,aint bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,name a more iconic duo
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is the big spicy collab that datpiff was talking about right
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was really hyped for this collar review but i wish anthony did the review alone quint didnt add much and his volume was way too loud
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a more major collab than fab x trey songz
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey guys overall i thought the album was very good killer mike and elp come with harder hitting punchlines and can we give it up for elp this dude has been consistently producing incredible beats from his company flow days to the rtj series pure gems favourite beats on the album were down call ticketron thieves panther like a panther and a report to the shareholderkill your masters overall a from me ranking of rtj albums rtj rtj hope we get an rtj
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love them both but hearing quint say yeah or mhm after every word fantano said really irritated the shit outta me
hiphopheads,not_removed,i basically feel the same way as anthony and im glad he managed to bring up some legitimate criticism amidst all the hype for this album there were plenty of excellent songs here but the reason i still like more is because of those clunky moments fantano mentioned where the flows and beats couldnt quite keep up with the new content and subject matter every single song on on the other hand felt totally natural and basically perfected to me even if they werent all as ambitious with their lyrical topics im glad mike and el are pushing themselves though and i think that creative development will be what keeps rtj interesting going forward since they seem to show no signs of stopping anytime soon id like to see them go even more experimental with the next record and incorporate more of what made them interesting as solo artists story tracks like thieves especially had me craving something like where they both play characters in a full narrative track in the end though its still a quality release and with tracks like ticketron and hey kids i cant really complain to much with what i got
hiphopheads,not_removed,not gonna lie i got pretty hyped to see a bigquint x fantano review nice to see a more serious perspective from biqquint too
hiphopheads,not_removed,can we get a review with just fantano without big quint saying mmhmm yeah after every fucking word that comes out of his mouth
hiphopheads,not_removed,i couldnt stand the q and a type video they were doing but great to see rtj got a good score
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love bigquints reviews i love his first reaction videos but you dont really get that much in depth analysis from them and hes definitely capable of it love to see some insight from him great album great summation of the album great way to end the year
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love big quint but this is unwatchable he adds absolutely nothing to the discussion side of things
hiphopheads,not_removed,this ia the collab we needed dreams do come true
hiphopheads,not_removed,this shit was a banger the surprise in the last track made me jump out of my chair and vigorously do jumping jacks
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant even watch this because of how loud quint is fantano shouldve corrected the volume for the review because it is really annoying to listen to right now
hiphopheads,not_removed,you already know my boii big quint had to fix up that hairline for this video looking spiffy
hiphopheads,not_removed,now reviewers are making collabs
hiphopheads,not_removed,this was weird quint didnt exactly shine on this man the way they are reviewing stuff is so fundamentally different that i didnt expect it to work anyways
hiphopheads,not_removed,quint is kinda like when my english teacher talks to me about the nuances of shakespeare
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was hoping for a dual first reaction but this is still great
hiphopheads,not_removed,never watched a bigquint video before but he really ruined this for me he doesnt give any interesting commentary just how fucking much he loves it and then he kept fucking saying yeah oh yeah definitely no doubt for sure every time fantano said a word
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely anticipated a higher score but as always fantano articulates and explains himself well i also wasnt crazy about down but i think it functions fine as an opener starting a little softer makes it that much better when it transitions into the more hardhitting talk to me to me it felt pretty similar to the transition from jeopardy into oh my darling also isnt it call ticketron not tickerton
hiphopheads,not_removed,the collab needed
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like is their low end theory and is midnight marauders both records were at their peak production levels imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,never watched a big quint video but this collab doesnt paint him as either articulate nor particularly knowledgeable maybe thats fantano edging him out but this was hard to watch also whats up with how loud quint is compared to anthony dude smothers him
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah this is seriously unwatchable quint should shut the fuck up more
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just cant stand rtj i gots nothin but mad love for elp old company flow fan killer mike is cool too but together personally i think it sounds like shit just sayin
hiphopheads,not_removed,i read this comment before i watched the interview and it made it so fucking funny
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats hilarious so true man
hiphopheads,not_removed,there were no winners
hiphopheads,not_removed,deleted
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think it sets the tone for the album perfectly the first track of announces there pressence then on jeopardy is a fight song then down looks back on the road they took to get where they are now
hiphopheads,not_removed,i expected more love down has a gorgeous beat
hiphopheads,not_removed,easily my favorite track on the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,it feels like the opening track to a james bond movie
hiphopheads,not_removed,the beat is so rich definitely one of my favorites on the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,top song on rtj
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah that was probably my favourite on the albumim not sure it was best placed as the intro track but as an individual song i loved it especially the beat and the hook
hiphopheads,not_removed,the hook of this song turns me off from it every time
hiphopheads,not_removed,havent watched it yet did these guys clown on that track thats like one of my favourite songs this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,one of my favorite tracks on the album and the perfect framing device to transition from the sound to the more aggressive and politically charged style of
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really really like down but i feel it is placed in a strange spot on the album talk to me should be first the first line is we return from the depths of the badlands it sounds like it was made to be first it thematically matches the intros of their other albums down feels like a midalbum track
hiphopheads,not_removed,when talk to me came out i remember i was sort of disappointed but with down coming before it the song is so much better and makes much more sense i remember even fantano said it was lackluster for an rtj track and now its on his favorites talk to me needs down before it
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre gonna need a bigger boat boy
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah it was the mature prologue a new rtj album needed wasnt about buildingmaintaining hype just mike and el genuinely reflecting on where they are now just before the shitstorm really kicks in with the next song and doesnt stop for the whole rest of the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,its one of the few tracks on here i like im so fucking sick of their bangers
hiphopheads,not_removed,fantano fits too naturally
hiphopheads,not_removed,straight from mexico call her quintano
hiphopheads,not_removed,sidebar pic when holidays end mods
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy fuck this is amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like this should be on one of those supreme sweatshirt that all streetwear people rock
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is too perfect
hiphopheads,not_removed,good i didnt wanna watch fantano hump his chair and eat his vegan snacks anyways thats reserved for quint only
hiphopheads,not_removed,this woulda been the most awkward video ever if quint was reacting i dont think i coulda handled that
hiphopheads,not_removed,quint the kind of guy who you see in a suit out in the hallway on the phone intensely engaged in the conversation pacing back and forth
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was so annoying i feel like anthony couldve said literally anything and quint wouldve agreed as he said it anthony so this album really made me feel like hitting my wife quint oh yeah anthony and that makes me feel like hitting kids qunint for sure mmhmm anthony now that i think about it its good to abuse people just for fun qunit yup definitely for sure man i can see that
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i think quints acknowledgements wouldnt be so annoying if the levels were fixed
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh ye oh ye mhm oh ye straight up ye ye mm mm oh ye yeyeah
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao dear god i thought you were exaggerating every time fantano spoke lol im dying
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think part of the problem was fantanos mic was way quieter than quints but that was definitely unneeded
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think its just that quints mic was louder wouldnt be as bad if they were on the same level
hiphopheads,not_removed,mhm mhm forshore forshore
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah this made the review totally unwatchable for me i was genuinely interested to hear fantanos thoughts on the album but this format just makes it annoying to listen to i wish he would have just done a normal review and had this as a sidebar discussion
hiphopheads,not_removed,long comment ignore if you have adhd or if you know whats good for you jk just a little rant on people who agree constantly i love big quint i watch every reacton vid he releases i think hes got great character and hes entertaining af however one thing that annoyed me in this was how agreeable he was with anthony like i think he agreed with of anthonys sentences now the main reason it bothers me is i used to be like this and still find myself slipping into it now im not gonna project my reasons for being like that onto quint cause thats just not reasonable but someone said something recently about this type of character trait in some vlog i think i saw they said people who constantly agree usually do so to maintain a cordial interaction they said on one end of the spectrum you have people who agree all the time and it can be perceived as a somewhat undesirable trait because it means your directing the convo to please the other person and keep them on your good side in a kind of way on the other end of the spectrum you have people who are always oppositional and in extreme cases these are the types of people that fill prisons they dont have the other persons interests at all in mind they have zero intent to please anyone sometimes its a defense mechanism because theyve found in their life they dont know how to please people and maybe had unhealthy relations with people they were trying to please as a young person they end up just giving up or trying to keep people at bay so they wont be let down again now again im not saying this is what quint is like i actually found it to be a normal common convo most people might have and i will even grant quint that he actually did agree with everything anthony asserted it just reminded me of me and i kind of cringe at myself for it ive been like this for years but ive made a conscious effort recently to not do the constant verbal agree cues such as mmmhmmm yeah right yeah every seconds it sounds annoying when you hear it outside of your own head and ill even make devils advocate arguments just to try it more and i noticed that this is something that i almost never ever did before because it felt so unnatural to do now i realized that in many convos i was just trying to keep the other person comfortable and keep the convo nonconfrontational and looking back i see that as kind of a weak trait and i realize also that there are people who spot that type of trait in people and will tend to take advantage of them because they know that person will most likely say yes to whatever you ask of them anyways i love that these two got together to do this and im not hating in any way i just think that maybe someone else who does this will notice it in themself and might be more conscious of it and might change before you get years deep in perpetualpleasantpeoplepleasing without realizing peace ohhh fucking love this album
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly made it hard to watch this
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive only listened to the first or tracks but call ticketrons hook was infectious i always find myself repeating the hook during the day
hiphopheads,not_removed,stay gold might be my favourite track for that hook alone might be my fave rtj hook ever
hiphopheads,not_removed,mhm yep yep for sure yep mhm yeah mmmm yep
hiphopheads,not_removed,i get so pissed off when a meow the jewels remix of one of my fav rtj songs come on spotify i just pissed offedly change it to the proper version
hiphopheads,not_removed,my favorite part is when fantanos head actually turned in to a melon and he popped it off his body and fed it to quint
hiphopheads,not_removed,fantano just called quint his n word holy shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a shame they cut their discussion of colonialism in the century short because of anthonys rants in defence of eugenics and the german genocide in namibia i thoroughly enjoyed quints analysis of how the belgian colonization of the congo has effected the modern nation
hiphopheads,not_removed,but did you see that part where anthony got up and started dancing saying this is all you do in your videos that was crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,good lord not the n word nigga is bad enough but the n word thats way worse
hiphopheads,not_removed,i liked the review but was kinda surprised when it evolved into a bitch fight about contemporary feminism and black lives matter bigquint just rage quit the call when anthony started shouting alllivesmatter lmao hope they can make up again
hiphopheads,not_removed,what time did fantano say that
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep rtj is a better album and id give rtj a solid
hiphopheads,not_removed,yup i think most of the albums on fantanos top albums were and i dont think hes ever given a so am from fantano basically means a top tier album edit he has given tens
hiphopheads,not_removed,fabolous and trey songz
hiphopheads,not_removed,frank ocean and yung lean
hiphopheads,not_removed,michael scott and dwight schrute in that rap music video they made
hiphopheads,not_removed,paul simon desiigner
hiphopheads,not_removed,please format that ranking lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah habeas corpses and dont die are some great narrative tracks i feel like they could pull it off well together nice review
hiphopheads,not_removed,such points as uh huh yeah and oh yeah mmhmm yeah dont forget yeah man for sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah u aint watched a minute video in minutes
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep yeah yeah totally yup mmhmm
hiphopheads,not_removed,mmm mmhmm yeah yeah
hiphopheads,not_removed,iirc he gave a pretty strong and that was higher than feel free to correct me if im wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,consistent as as what
hiphopheads,not_removed,he gave a strong but this one a light was expecting a but this is still a really positive review
hiphopheads,not_removed,ticketron oldschool reference obviously given the sample at the end its always interesting to see things that genx and y do that have no context for younger people like watching venture brothers where i realize so much must be going over the average adult swim viewers heads
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really dont understand this comparison outside them both being good albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think down has my favorite elp verse he just keeps going in
hiphopheads,not_removed,does it remind you of anything it sounds an awful lot like a track off of els cancer cure
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont see u say this opinion enough maybe u should say it again
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love all their bangers it has nothing to do with me liking down
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats because fantano and elp have the same body type
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn she rate me low
hiphopheads,not_removed,fucking ayyyy
hiphopheads,not_removed,im unsubscribing if this doesnt happen
hiphopheads,not_removed,holidays over where my mods out right now brah
hiphopheads,not_removed,did anybody save it i missed it
hiphopheads,not_removed,that all streetwear people rock lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,id watch fantano jump around then drink a
hiphopheads,not_removed,is he really a vegan
hiphopheads,not_removed,im hollering
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmaooooo oh my god im cackling
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah they actually fix towards the end not sure if fantano does it or what and it sounds wayyyy less in your face
hiphopheads,not_removed,fo sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think quint was trying to appease fantano and not create conflict i think it was due to the discrepancy of knowledge between them fantano actually reviews while thinking about structure technique lyrics theme etc his reviews are actual reviews while quints are basically him just getting hyped while listening to an album for the first time fantano is a critic quint is a fan theres nothing wrong with this and i never expected quint to come with some deep insight into the album anyway so it makes sense that instead he listened to fantano and agreed with him because he recognizes that fantano specializes in that so he takes his word for it
hiphopheads,not_removed,those verbal agree cues are a way of showing youre listening intently the frequency might be off but thats a perfectly fine way to show respect to the speaker
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow this is a really great comment im sorry more people havent had the opportunity to see it im certain itd be insightful for a lot of posters here im in complete agreement with you though i was never really the type of person to constantly agree in fact ive always been the type of person to call people out on their bullshit or on things that i dont necessarily agree with i base my mentality on the concept of philosophical minimalism i try not to complicate my own feelings on matters when possible and i genuinely think its a problem that is born out of peoples inability to confidently hold conversations where opinions are exchanged by this i mean that there are people who cannot properly express dissent towards an opinion without making it seem like its coming from a place of anger or malice theyre unable to shit talk people they dont intimately know because they ostensibly fear rejection andor the concerns of a conversation partner who doesnt realize that theyre joking around i know this is a weird explanation but its something ive noticed a lot i have some family members that are terrible at it i think that being able to shit talk or express disagreementsinsults without being mean is a skill seriously its ones skill in conversation i too was cringing at quints inability to disagree or express his own opinion on the album it really struck me as unintentionally immature like he was just out of his element and in a situation he didnt want to ruin its something ive also seen him do in the past with some more controversial albums he doesnt like to rock the boat and give his own opinions possibly because hes scared of doing it possibly because at this point hes scared to even develop his own opinion sorry if this post seemed like rambling but i think its an important topic and needs to be brought up more
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i wish they couldve been in the same video together instead of a skype call but what can you do i understand that its long distant but i just really wish there was a way because it was hard to watch i agree
hiphopheads,not_removed,best break time ever
hiphopheads,not_removed,yummy
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,the first disc of the powers that b
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was really shocked in the middle when fantano was talking about how hitler did nothing wrong and his policies would have worked if he was a better military tactician quint actually agreed with him even though hes always been a stalin apologist and goes out of his way in his videos to shit on the idea of the third reich i think he knew he was out of his depth and wanted to kiss up to fantano
hiphopheads,not_removed,gotta admit quints criticism of marxist dialectic dragged on a bit
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo guess how i know you didnt watch the whole thing two minutes after that he started doing it again and said brotha im just dancing like a jive turkey for these crackas jus like yall seriously lost all respect for him man
hiphopheads,not_removed,my nathans
hiphopheads,not_removed,noctus
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean youre not wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok dis soft
hiphopheads,not_removed,whooosh
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,why do you feel is better not necessarily disagreeing just curious what you thought imo was more consistent but i think had higher highs and lower lows panther and the closing track make the last half of the album amazing but i feel like the first few tracks arent as great as some of the stuff on
hiphopheads,not_removed,no is so boring compared to rtj and
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes given
hiphopheads,not_removed,and i dont think hes ever given a he has the money store by death grips to be kind by swans and tpab
hiphopheads,not_removed,too bad everybody already made their lists fab is coming to fuck all that up
hiphopheads,not_removed,major
hiphopheads,not_removed,major
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol thx dont know why it came out like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks man even if most people dont feel like reading my block of text i just needed to unload my thoughts somewhere after thinking about this album all week haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,but hes already made some good insights theyve summed up a lot of the songs i was looking for call ticketron kill your masters dont really care about the number rating they give at the end and its been more than minutes
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh yeah totally
hiphopheads,not_removed,nope your right melon head does believe rtj keeps getting better and i personally feel this way too i enjoyed this album better than the previous two
hiphopheads,not_removed,someone hasnt been to nz
hiphopheads,not_removed,and midnight marauders are perfectedpeak versions of their sound imo thats what im saying
hiphopheads,not_removed,fantano damage
hiphopheads,not_removed,yung dadbod
hiphopheads,not_removed,and about the same skintone as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,same tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel very out of touch with them myself and im only lmao even making jackets for some of their users right now
hiphopheads,not_removed,eat your fucking greens like an adult
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah used to weigh over lbs as a teenager and has a crazily healthy diet since
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol im chortling
hiphopheads,not_removed,fantano is a critic quint is a fan this i am unfamiliar with quint but have watched anthony for a while now this was exactly the impression i got one was a reaction the other a critic like you said though just different styles and not inherently bad or anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,sure his post may not be completely relevant but you dont have to be rude
hiphopheads,not_removed,why did i actually believe all this for a sec
hiphopheads,not_removed,u right i had cut off the video in disgust he did that smh tragedy dae
hiphopheads,not_removed,black emperor king ruler
hiphopheads,not_removed,talk to me legend has it hey kids thieves and are among my favorite rtj tracks theyve put out to this point but i felt like the standard for the rest of the album was lower than rtj
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think my only gripe with is the hook on stay gold the rest of it is killer
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah man you just answered your question
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think first four or five are very great i love down and the after it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i felt that there were alot of weak tracks on rtj imo tracks like hey kids stay gold yikes for that hook lol dont get captured and panther like a panther drag the album down and those are the weakest tracks on the album the only weak tracks on rtj were love again and lie cheat steal also like you said the first few tracks on rtj first few tracks on rtj ultimately imo rtj would have been more impactful if it only had tracks however its still dope as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,what ones tpab madvillian cheers boys
hiphopheads,not_removed,anyone who hasnt heard to be kind is in for a huge treat
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow i never knew definitely albums worthy of the anyone who hasnt listens to these should
hiphopheads,not_removed,key alert
hiphopheads,not_removed,its still messed up bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah nah
hiphopheads,not_removed,well he gave this a strong so i guess he doesnt think that exactly
hiphopheads,not_removed,i havent
hiphopheads,not_removed,i should go to nz 🤔
hiphopheads,not_removed,its mean as bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh okay i was wondering why hes still clearly pretty out of shape lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol im laughing out loud
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck you ted
hiphopheads,not_removed,i absolutely love that hook best hook on the album in my opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,no he didnt
hiphopheads,not_removed,his question was someone elses opinion and then gave his own i fail to see how that answers his question
hiphopheads,not_removed,what panther like panther is a bannnnger
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey kids thats the best track man and danny brown on top crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,to be kind tpab the money store
hiphopheads,not_removed,swans to be kind death grips the money store kendrick to pimp a bitterfly
hiphopheads,not_removed,tpab to be kind and the money store madvillainy probably would have a if he had been reviewing then but he doesnt give scores to albums he heard before starting the channel
hiphopheads,not_removed,every classic he has reviewed is a strong or a so madvilliany was a most probably he has only given a to three modern albums tpab the money store and a swans album that i dont remember the name for
hiphopheads,not_removed,death grips the money store swans to be kind kendrick lamar to pimp a butterfly
hiphopheads,not_removed,tlop bittsm and views
hiphopheads,not_removed,also all of the albums reviewed in his classic reviews including madvillainy are
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive been wanting to check swans out but the long album times kinda spook me i have no attention span at all and i tend to doze off on some albums halfway lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know i much preferred the seer
hiphopheads,not_removed,good talk
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think being vegan can replace working out
hiphopheads,not_removed,he is pretty built
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt find it that funny but i did exhale a bit through my nose
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh im crying now
hiphopheads,not_removed,jumping jacks
hiphopheads,not_removed,rtj has never been the best with hooks but this is one of my favorites
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree but i got an issue with the hook
hiphopheads,not_removed,at the risk of invoking the ire of hhh did he really give a death grips album a everything ive heard from death grips strikes me as a bit of a memegimmick which isnt to say that i dont like it its just a
hiphopheads,not_removed,he reviewed madvillainy for classic week and classic week albums are all
hiphopheads,not_removed,to be kind is a piece of art
hiphopheads,not_removed,its hard to do that during this album its something else entirely i highly recommend doing it
hiphopheads,not_removed,in the album things dont stay the same for too long usually the beat will build up until its just pure insanity then it will crumble under its own weight and another song will be made out of whats leftover not to mention the crazy lyrics and screaming sound effects and the synths they use throughout this
hiphopheads,not_removed,i did that with cudis latest album i didnt even think it was bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,i disagree both fantastic though
hiphopheads,not_removed,¯ツ¯
hiphopheads,not_removed,well he could be skinny from being vegan at least lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,i guess for people with low standards of what built is
hiphopheads,not_removed,i had a hearty guffaw
hiphopheads,not_removed,no hook is as bad as stay gold
hiphopheads,not_removed,where does he say theyre all hes been pretty critical of some of the classics albums he said the vocals on kid a didnt age well i dont think he says that they necessarily are perfect albums they were more so groundbreaking and influential
hiphopheads,not_removed,classics are not all classics are classics thats fucking it
hiphopheads,not_removed,deleted
hiphopheads,not_removed,he probably just isnt lean
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha we need a ama session of rtj so they can explain what on earth they were thinking with that horrible hook still a great album nonetheless
hiphopheads,not_removed,not sure about his other classic week albums but on his rateyourmusic account he has madvillainy listed as a you can see all the albums he gave perfect scores to at edit it should be noted that rateyourmusic does a rating scale so his scores of on his channel would be a
hiphopheads,not_removed,that feel when i cant fucking deadlift but fantano can dl despite having the physique of dr robotnik﻿ this comment on the video made me lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyve never had amazing hooks but i agree there were a few hooks on that were noticeably bad call tickerton is still insane despite the weak hook but stay gold and hey kids really suffer from it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i always knew fantano was real
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn thanks for this never seen his full list of ratings including older albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,deleted
hiphopheads,not_removed,i actually kinda like the live from the garden sample think it might be my favorite song overall on the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,best hook on the entire album by far
hiphopheads,not_removed,tidal
hiphopheads,not_removed,datpiff
hiphopheads,not_removed,prob the same mod whose mom got mad at them for the spotify playlist

hiphopheads,not_removed,meirl
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought i was the only one ive been doing this i dont feel ashamed anymore someone like me
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah acid puts you in a whole new reality and basically changes every single aspect of how your brain works only way i can describe it is like going to a new universe with an alien mind stories like this is why you always have a trip sitter last time i tripped i thought time quit working and the geometric patterns on everything were so intense i could not comprehend how my brain was making that shit happen
hiphopheads,not_removed,if he really did two tabs he definitely was on one
hiphopheads,not_removed,skimming through it my first impression was that it sounds very amateur as expected however the more i listened to it the more i realized it reminded me a lot of no where near as cohesive or compelling but it has that lofiretro feel considering i adore that album thats definitely a compliment keep it up
hiphopheads,not_removed,i realize this sub isnt really for just beats but i just really love this community and i like the feedback you guys bring usually its really helpful
hiphopheads,not_removed,please post with the proper format in the future also look at rmakinghiphop its a great community
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow thanks that means a lot kuedo is sick love that album ya i am really amature but im addicted to it its just so much fun to mess around on ableton thanks again for the encouragement

hiphopheads,not_removed,ah gotcha thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,which part
hiphopheads,not_removed,was it for king kunta
hiphopheads,not_removed,ah thank you kindly two is such a shorter word tho weird
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,no problem is there a story behind your username i dont recall any storylines involving razors fapping habits
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,schoolboy qs two album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant remember why this is my name tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,i respect that still great backstory or not
hiphopheads,not_removed,at a time when hip hop is pushing so many boundaries musically socially etc logic is just so safe theres really nothing remarkable about him hes what i would expect if i gave someone a rap playlist a stereotypical struggle background some boom bap sample beats you could make in fl studio in minutes and a microphone and told them to create a rap persona
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love this dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,logic is like a artist hes not particularly the best at anything and a lot of what works seems like it was copied off someone else but he has a good flow doesnt make overly corny songs and tries to at least talk about something real for white teenagers hes like the transition artist between ty rappers and good music like pre calc before you actually learn something worthwhile hes the tolerable pain you have in your cavity that you can put off for a minute before you go to the dentist hes that that you to get good at sex before you actually someone you care about hes a necessary evil so whenever you hear about someones favorite artist being logic just smile and move on because you know theyre in a sort of musical puberty before they discover music that doesnt send cringe waves down your spine
hiphopheads,not_removed,logic isnt good
hiphopheads,not_removed,forever young assuming you mean welcome to forever
hiphopheads,not_removed,is this a new copypasta because i swear ive seen this posted before
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not a logic fan but this just seems like a really shitty thing to say hopefully this is just a copypasta
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean by no means is he my favorite rapper i just respect where hes at skill wise especially since he just came up also you must have skipped a word or two in your paragraph about sex because that literally doesnt make sense no hate i just cant understand what you meant
hiphopheads,not_removed,how is this shitty its true
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes that bitch that you fuck to get good at sex before you actually fuck someone you care about
hiphopheads,not_removed,its getting remastered i heard some where
hiphopheads,not_removed,also been off apple music for a week or two now hopefully itll get back up soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe getting rereleases similar to imperial
hiphopheads,not_removed,ima fix ultimate
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is great im fucking dying for the getback
hiphopheads,not_removed,felt like frenchs song and he def had the best verse kinda disappointing i dont really see myself going back to this
hiphopheads,not_removed,fresh juelz ft camron what
hiphopheads,not_removed,woooooooooaaaaaaahhhhh
hiphopheads,not_removed,aye this is fucking tight i need the unedited cdq in my life asap
hiphopheads,not_removed,this shit is tightttt id love a dipset comeback in
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit is juelz back
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha yeah thats how i found this i remembered over a week ago datpiff notifying me a new juelz mixtape was dropping in a week so i was searching for the name of the tape and in the news results was this just posted
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn u know its bad when french has the best verse
hiphopheads,not_removed,tape drops this week or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to coke wave or coke boys and say that
hiphopheads,not_removed,french is great
hiphopheads,not_removed,the beats made that shit hot i could sneeze over a harry fraud track and get some buzz
hiphopheads,not_removed,you know youre gonna have a good time when you hear that la musica de harry fraud
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh wut i love it
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks brother
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah noticed that too the first lines
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck x piece of shit glad x is out waiting for diss tracks you dont needa scroll any farther into this thread
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn drakes mom is probably gonna see this on her google alerts too x seems like a complete shithead but cant say im not a little entertained
hiphopheads,not_removed,watch out i think owes him one
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes so desperate for drake to respond lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,this man jumped to insulting moms straight off the rip goddamn man skipped a few steps
hiphopheads,not_removed,clearly x wants attention drake wont respond and i believe he shouldnt theres no need to get into a beef with a fckung child who slings yo momma insults you dont get cool points for that
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake should just blacklist him from the industry never address it and make sure people never address him
hiphopheads,not_removed,whos mans is this
hiphopheads,not_removed,already tired of hearing about him
hiphopheads,not_removed,x is like the rap game lavar ball
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn bruh this guy takes it too far lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,xxxtentacion hey drake im obsessed with u gimme some attention
hiphopheads,not_removed,how can one man be so cringe and hypocritical
hiphopheads,not_removed,you know chubbs like draymond
hiphopheads,not_removed,drakes gonna send his shooters rip x
hiphopheads,not_removed,dudes becoming too edgy for me in his video talking about seconds of original drake he sounds like those stupid youtube lil gayne not real music comments
hiphopheads,not_removed,this guy is embarrassing man
hiphopheads,not_removed,imma just downvote this post because im tired of hearing about this young fuck boi just another rash nigga in the spotlight publicity stunts are just too easy these days
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,bro keep this dude away from women
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit x will not give this up i need this beef i need these diss tracks
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like x and i do think drake ripped off look at me but this is starting to look pretty lame its obvious hes just trying to get attention at this point
hiphopheads,not_removed,disrespectful little shit stain
hiphopheads,not_removed,say what you want about his music but its nice seeing a rapper being upfront with their dissing instead of doing the subliminal shit rappers do nowadays
hiphopheads,not_removed,corny af
hiphopheads,not_removed,new low
hiphopheads,not_removed,this guys so amateur and theres nothing special about his music stop hopping on his dick rhiphopheads
hiphopheads,not_removed,what is wrong with him does he think this is funny or something we get it drake copped your flow and you think hes a bitch now stop
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh fuck i cant wait to see what comes outta this whole situation lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,who
hiphopheads,not_removed,jesus christ this is cringe
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao i love this dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,man today just keeps getting better and better
hiphopheads,not_removed,he got told not to play why he still playing around with shit that aint safe
hiphopheads,not_removed,x might put another hole in her if drakes not careful
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont like his music but at least i gotta admire how hungry he is
hiphopheads,not_removed,this guy has to be my favorite out right aside from kendrick
hiphopheads,not_removed,we thought we were gonna get drake vs kdot but instead we get drake stans vs xxxtentacleporn stans this is the darkest timeline
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think you forgot hes a dick but i think he has potential in his music and im interested in seeing what he does and the reply that says his ex set him up x did nothing wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,good looking out
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty much shows how fucking immature this sub is
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just have the popcorn out tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck your right them shits go straight to her phone too
hiphopheads,not_removed,considering his age and the general publics reaction to kmt i feel like x is being enabled and is using the whole thing to get more attention his way not saying this is good or bad but it does seem like hes sorta going out of his way with posting this picture
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes a soundcloud rapper lmao its not like hes gonna turn ugly god and lil boom against him or anything edit also based off of meek mills features on drake cant blackball people
hiphopheads,not_removed,his interview from yesterday already has views a blacklist wont stop people from talking about him only thing stopping him now is either his fans growing out of him which will take time or ending up back in jail
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats he gonna do get him banned from soundcloud
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think blacklisting people is lame
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake should just blacklist him from the industry yeah just black ball him its just that simple spoken like someone who has no idea what theyre talking about
hiphopheads,not_removed,i for one welcome our new shit talking overlords
hiphopheads,not_removed,xxxattention
hiphopheads,not_removed,it get his name out there a ton more if drake reaponds
hiphopheads,not_removed,the thing is x has so much ammo against himself that drake can use lmao what can x say if this actually turns into a beef that hasnt been uttered about drake times before
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes a fixaaaaaaah
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty sure none of these are completely right she was never pregnant and he might not have even been the one to beat her she ripped off xs fans in a gofundme there is way more to the story than that iirc he wasnt just looking at him and he warned him a lot read this and think what you want not that i really care because kmt is hard but just because xxx wasnt the first to use it doesnt mean look at me wasnt blowing tf up when kmt premiered at that one concert by this logic drake bit whoever xxx bit anyway his music is flames and i doubt youve listened to most of it
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh first off she wasnt pregnant aint even proven he did it second ting pretty shitty but seems like all talk third thing is unsubstantiated thing drake definitely did copy his flow
hiphopheads,not_removed,his songs are mostly good tho hes not that great of a person sure but if he wasnt crazy i wouldnt like him why because rappers with mental issues are helpful to their fans they understand you dont understand how nice it is to hear something like lets pretend were numb because he always says a message to his fans going through shit at the beginning
hiphopheads,not_removed,his entire existence is based on being edgy
hiphopheads,not_removed,but you took your time to write this
hiphopheads,not_removed,no way a diss track is happening lol its still entertaining though
hiphopheads,not_removed,when did rhhh start being pussies about everything jesus christ hes fucking around and everyone acts like he assaulted drakes mom
hiphopheads,not_removed,bet you must cry yourself to sleep when you hear one of the old diss tracks
hiphopheads,not_removed,i get that people have used the flow xxx used on look at me before but if you listen to look at me then kmt its almost exactly the fuckin same i dont get how people can say he didnt rip him off
hiphopheads,not_removed,worse has happened in hiphop than i wanna fuck your mom lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,who calls ppl a shit stainwtf
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wanna fuck your mom yeah this is the kind of dissing ive really been wanting to see s i dont like drake or any other artists subliminal shit but this is twitter fingers shit its no better until he starts releasing diss tracks this is just as lame
hiphopheads,not_removed,wheres the bars without bars dissing is just drama and gossip that hip hop listeners dont feel gay for keeping up with
hiphopheads,not_removed,wtf kind of weak shit is this you call that a diss more like some middle school insults
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah this shit sus why is dissing another rapper nice hip hop a reality show to some of yall huh
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait what hhh are you on because this sub literally hates him as a person and hates his music
hiphopheads,not_removed,he may have mental issues
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to digital dash by drake and future they both use that flow
hiphopheads,not_removed,the post went from to likes in the time it took to read your comment pretty sure people think its funny
hiphopheads,not_removed,me too
hiphopheads,not_removed,xxxtentacion
hiphopheads,not_removed,he would be better off not doing this shit and just getting his mind straight if you ask me
hiphopheads,not_removed,xxxtentacleporn dead
hiphopheads,not_removed,this timeline is the funniest timeline though
hiphopheads,not_removed,both spectrum are just equally bad lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,he said on ig live hes doing it for more publicity
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek is too hard to be black balled plus the city loves him like they love rocky
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek shoulda blackballed diddy for that pathetic excuse of a feature
hiphopheads,not_removed,no but eventually hes going to want to start working with some bigger names
hiphopheads,not_removed,hell definitely be back in jail dude is not stable but thats really his appeal i guess
hiphopheads,not_removed,but wait there are plenty artists with a million views on youtube stuck right where they are
hiphopheads,not_removed,only people whove gotten blacklisted say stuff like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,your argument seems to be drake cant do it because x is underground well if youve listened to his interviews youll know that he doesnt want to stay underground
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake wont respond to x if he doesnt bother responding to pusha t joe budden and kendrick
hiphopheads,not_removed,not to mention that drake is friends with pretty much the whole genre no matter how underground you want to stay setting your career up like this is corny reminds me of hopsin dissing wayne rick ross etc back in the day
hiphopheads,not_removed,if i ever gotta fix tings
hiphopheads,not_removed,read this and think what you want so basically he took the money and didnt send him any verse then when the dude that paid him money got pissed and starting talking he went over and beat his ass because thats what im getting from that story this dude is a classic bitch yall gotta stop defending him
hiphopheads,not_removed,jesus christ listen to yourself
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a x fan but the third thing happened
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmfao
hiphopheads,not_removed,reddit fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,talking shit about giving someones mom the dick just to get some attention shit is pathetic
hiphopheads,not_removed,only when i listen to the warning
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake used the flow in digital dash though
hiphopheads,not_removed,this just in you can never say anything negative about anyone ever unless they have done the worst thing that has happened in hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,man pac and biggie died off your mom and i fucked your bitch jokes
hiphopheads,not_removed,well it is disrespectful which is kind of the point no regardless x is salty over drake using a similar flow as his in a song in which he also took it from someone else either hes really salty over something so stupid or hes using drakes name to prop himself up
hiphopheads,not_removed,usteez
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah its still fucked up bringing peoples moms up in conversation and weak to do so if anyone talked about my mom like that and posted a photo of her id be more than furious but drake probs just wipes his tears away with bands
hiphopheads,not_removed,yall are reading too much into this all i said was hes disrespectful and yall x groupies are coming to defend his image relax shits not that serious
hiphopheads,not_removed,i definitely agree that id rather hear it on a track i guess im just impressed that someone is really going at drake and being blunt about it edit i dont know why people act as if i said hes the one and only person to do this i know this i get it
hiphopheads,not_removed,you sound new to rap
hiphopheads,not_removed,this sub hates him about half of every thread about him is filled with fans defending him and his music gets upvoted a lot
hiphopheads,not_removed,people like drama
hiphopheads,not_removed,dick ride much
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean xxxtentacruel is going at drakes mom talking about tapioca im fucking dead dude the blogs are gonna be steamin tommorow but the comments sections on this sub lately have been terrorism
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you dont like x just get at a nigga in my dms and we can link up so i can cut ya eyes out put em on ya tongue so u can make sure u watch what ya mouth say lol from the insta comments
hiphopheads,not_removed,they are i hate people who call every opinion a circlejerk but the conflicting x circlejerk has been annoying
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek dealt with a whole year of getting l spammed in his comments and being in jail hes lowkey strong af lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait on cold hearted i kinda liked the commentary lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,eh j cole went double plat no features hell be fine
hiphopheads,not_removed,mgk
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake and xxx are in such different areas of the music industry drake has almost control of anyone in xs lane no underground rappers or producer give a shit about this in fact they probably like it fucked up thing to say and do but i mean he just got out of jail for beating his girl my guess is this is pretty light compared to other cringy things hes got up his sleeve for the future drake should just go to miami and beat that ass thats a boss move and would be way more effective in black balling him than telling people to not work with him
hiphopheads,not_removed,furious
hiphopheads,not_removed,he has responded to all of them even name dropped joe budden on stage
hiphopheads,not_removed,he been responded to pusha and kendrick
hiphopheads,not_removed,x is already cool with the mob and lil uzi tho so i mean its not like he aint gonna get no features
hiphopheads,not_removed,he hasnt built his career on this at all he was huge before the whole drake thing a good of all his songs got plays on it on youtube im sure this drake shit gave him some more clout but in no way is his career built on this drake incident
hiphopheads,not_removed,did you even read it and i like how you just ignored the other points
hiphopheads,not_removed,xxx is ok i think he has potential i think yall jus being unfair
hiphopheads,not_removed,well more to the story at the least
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant save everyone
hiphopheads,not_removed,what did i do wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,obviously its for attention everyone says it like its a bad thing he wants more hype im going to market the shit out of this
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah its not just the flow though its everything put the songs on at the same time and they sound way to similar for it to be a coincidence put digital dash on too and they sound nothing alike
hiphopheads,not_removed,well thats not even my point this is genuinely harmless and honestly i doubt drake cares as much as some of the people in this thread i mean hes heard some bad shit considering hes like the most popular rapper right now like he reads worse in his ig comments thanks for being condescending tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmfao cooked him
hiphopheads,not_removed,he said in his interview that he knows exactly what hes doing lol so yeah hes using this for clout and hes not even afraid to say it and also i think x is more mad at the fact that drake called his manager and then went and talked about how he didnt even know x existed after the amsterdam video
hiphopheads,not_removed,by your logic tupac is weak why the fuck is it ok to threaten to kill your enemies but you cant talk about their family your soft ass code of ethics doesnt apply to hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,you sound real serious and hurt i dont listen to no drake or triple x whatever for the record
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn my bad i thought you were serious in judging a rapper based on his level of respect
hiphopheads,not_removed,he said shits not serious but called a dude disrespectful im done
hiphopheads,not_removed,plenty of people have went at drake bluntly
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont like anything about drake i dont like his fuckin voice i dont like what he talks about i dont like his face i dont like the way he walks nothing i dont like his haircut i might just let me shut up imma just stop right there obviously dmx isnt incredibly relevant these days but he had possibly the funniest and realest aubrey takedown weve heard so far
hiphopheads,not_removed,from what ive seen its like a split with of people somewhat liking the music
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah its really almost evenly split and the prevailing opinion depends on what the post is about
hiphopheads,not_removed,people like x
hiphopheads,not_removed,xxxtentacruel lmao this has to stop
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah this is just the beginning too imagine how shitll be when xxxtentomon decides to drop a new project
hiphopheads,not_removed,bro hes been doing gang shit since he was young im sure hes not worried about instagram comments lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,and who is lil uzi going to want on his tracks more x or drake being cool is one thing making money is another
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt mean it that way i just meant hes on the come up and now hes making this statement rappers have been blackballed over less although some blackballed artists have still made it french and max b pulled off the transition from blackballed to underground grind to mainstream success also bones is one of my favourite modern artists and most of his songs have that many views barring the less famous ones he releases through sheer volume and i still wouldnt say hes big
hiphopheads,not_removed,is far from huge he was far from a common name in the industry before drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,views aint that great though
hiphopheads,not_removed,its unfair to judge him for beating someone senseless cuz they did some gay shit i think most normal human beings would say thats a fair thing to judge him on
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah but even the way x told it is ducked i really like xs music but its pretty obvious hes not a good person and is at best unstable idrc tho tbh his fans all like worship him tho its kinda like of era tyler or someone thats why they refuse to accept hes done some shitty things
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats wrong with me
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah it is a bad thing when you insult someones family as a marketing tactic its fucked up
hiphopheads,not_removed,the beats dont sound the same look at mes beat sounds like shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake is super insecure and hes proven that he cant handle being disrespected this is definitely going to bother him
hiphopheads,not_removed,he probs wont care that much but its still disrespectful as shit bringing up his mom like just go after drake not his family lmao hes just trying to get more xxxattention
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think stealing his flow while he was in a jail cell is a bigger bitch move youd have to be a fucking moron to think that shit i hate most of drakes music and i do think hes a vulture but you clowns are bugging if you think drake took a generic flow from a shitty soundcloud rapper who already took the flow from someone else in the first place and even more transparently so copying the adlibs to the t
hiphopheads,not_removed,cool
hiphopheads,not_removed,you can judge him as a person based on that
hiphopheads,not_removed,stop being disrespectful
hiphopheads,not_removed,if a rapper doesnt clearly state re aubrey drake graham in a diss track then its a subliminal in this subs eyes
hiphopheads,not_removed,drama you mean
hiphopheads,not_removed,extension was my favorite meme name
hiphopheads,not_removed,underrated digimon
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk although he seems to be doing well despite the hate its still seeming to get to him he had to delete his ig
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre not mutually exclusive savage is good friends with meek mill and drake its not elementary were you have a friend who wont be your friend if youre chill with someone they dont like
hiphopheads,not_removed,rocky doesnt need a drake feature
hiphopheads,not_removed,tru i dont really listen to music based off how good the person is
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah drake didnt make the beat though
hiphopheads,not_removed,agree that he should just go after drake but are we fr now judging rappers based on their level of respect yeah theres a better way to beef but damn this shits never mattered up until now
hiphopheads,not_removed,alright im not arguing over this at just look up one of those crossover songs where they switch the beats and youll see that look at me and kmt are extremely similar and if you look at the time they were released youll see that kmt was recorded right around when look at me started getting big too much of a coincidence to be just a coincidence
hiphopheads,not_removed,super bozo
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is rhiphopheads not rjudgeapersonscharacter
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah hes a pretty good dj
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah its xxxtension cord
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was a fan of xxxtortellini myself
hiphopheads,not_removed,but rocky and drake go further back than rocky does with x drake helped rocky a lot early on in his career
hiphopheads,not_removed,so then why are you trying to back up his character in your earlier comments
hiphopheads,not_removed,¯ツ¯
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay but drake has used that flow back on digital dash in if not earlier just because you heard it for the first time with look at me does not mean it was pioneered there lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,we need a megathread for this tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,you make a great point
hiphopheads,not_removed,because i dont support discrediting someones character with unproven allegations and or lies in all actuality its highly probable that x did do some fucked shit but imma wait until its officially confirmed before imma speak on his character
hiphopheads,not_removed,¯ツ¯

hiphopheads,not_removed,idk took me a couple minutes but i managed to figure it out ¯ツ¯
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow are you the ceo of datpiff
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy ducking shit he got xv
hiphopheads,not_removed,general thoughts after listen clearly has a more pop vibe to it but its cool cause i expect that from yonas and he makes it sound good and somewhat meaningful i like the first verse and the first song for the most part although some of the singing varies hyped for the xv verse and he delivered even though the start was a little abrupt thought the original single summertime luv was pretty good but ironic since its getting pretty chilly here on the streets the third song was alright felt like it went on too long the title track is really well produced one of the beats reminds me of the beat from smoke again overall a good project but not nearly his best most of his prior work is better written and frankly i dont like when he gets this poppy but thats just me i prefer songs off proven theory or transition
hiphopheads,not_removed,im feeling it gives me a sense of nostalgia for some reason
hiphopheads,not_removed,you know im hyped need more xv in my life tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,this guy was poppin back when xv was still doing his thing i wonder how old the song is
hiphopheads,not_removed,i definitely agree with your assessment proven theory is my favorite yonas project to date i like the eps but i wish he would focus on a tapealbum i dont think we will get anything like pt or the transition but i would be happy with something like the transition which has a good blend of rap and pop btw hes releasing more bonus tracks for the ep in like weeks
hiphopheads,not_removed,good point but i know xv is making a comeback i think hes waiting on sample clearance and business implications before he can release his next project might be called the return from dagobah as thats what his twitter bio says
hiphopheads,not_removed,something like black canvas would be nice too thats good to hear about the extra songs i saw him tweet something about that but i only saw songs on apple music
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just love that he got kenny loggins and michael mcdonald on a track i mean dont me wrong the song is dope af but i was definitely not expecting that
hiphopheads,not_removed,published on jan
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit im glad he changed it i hate having a single and an album copy of the same song
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy fuck i cannot wait for this fuckkkkk
hiphopheads,not_removed,q said he released the single version without him because he wanted to save it for the album i have a feeling it may have to due with the rest of the concept with the album especially because throughout these recent interviews hes been really keen on not giving out any spoilers about the album edit also part of qs video series comes out tomorrow

hiphopheads,not_removed,i still really dont get the love for house of balloons i couldnt initially get into the weeknd because people hyped hob to death and i was off put until i tried out other stuff while tracks like what you need are amazing thursday is so much better and even then echoes of silence is head and shoulders better than both by far his worst project to me is hob eoskisslandthursdaybbtmhob
hiphopheads,not_removed,m o o d y
hiphopheads,not_removed,because the internetreally
hiphopheads,not_removed,good kid maad city because the internet and take care
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo why
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol oxymoron schoolboys worst album imo but to each his own
hiphopheads,not_removed,look that spot could be a lot of things but i thought it would be better to have something a little different in my eyes rodeo is pretty perfectas unexpected as that was for me before i heard it
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea not nearly as much as his first two tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,and pretty la
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol i know but in my world it can
hiphopheads,not_removed,so what just bc it was released almost a year ago people cant like it
hiphopheads,not_removed,millenium though
hiphopheads,not_removed,its interesting to me that you separate each of the albums within the trilogy as much as you do of course each is distinct but overall the sound he had across those was my favorite of his over the more poppy directions hes taken since then excluding his features for me it would be hobeosthursdaybbtmkissland i really didnt care for kissland except for a couple tracks bbtm was for me and hobeos are pretty closely tied because again the whole trilogy is what i think of when i think of the weeknd to answer your original comment though honestly between high for this what you need the morning and wicked games id give hob the win right there for those tracks alone just so good
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes idc if it sounds corny or whatever but besides the project being extremely solid and creative in its own right the screenplay just elevates the album into an absolutely amazing project each song mirrors the emotions conveyed by the part of the plot it represents which is just downright impressive every song brings out different emotions in me and the album handles the transition from fun to depressing to hopeless to hopeful so well its so cohesive as a whole and it is one of the few albums i can listen to from front to back imo it is one of the best concept albums of recent times
hiphopheads,not_removed,its his opinion man i thought it was a good album as well though not in my top
hiphopheads,not_removed,personal opinion yo also it makes me believe that marshall is now far away from his druggy life which inspires me
hiphopheads,not_removed,i prefer oxy because it feels much more personal and a lot more developed habits is more of a party album where he only briefly delves into serious topics about his life more just looking at the cool parts of being a rapper from the streets oxy really delves into the minutiae of the day to day life of someone trying to sell drugs to make his income and shows some really deep and interesting stuff blank face is awesome bangs and has flashes of brilliance but isnt as overall consistent in terms of its themes and messages as oxy i love all three projects but oxy is one of those albums i can put on no matter what kind of listening mood i am in just my two cents tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,im just surprised at how prevalent it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,not necessarily its just that when i pick my favorite albums i like to let them digest a bit but this many people loving rodeo is fine with me
hiphopheads,not_removed,mainstream tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,kissland would be the worst if professional wasnt on it that and the title track for me make the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha dude what have u even listened to habits raymond is a track about how he got into gangbanging blessed is deep af with that kendrick verse my homie is about how his boy sold him out if anything oxymoron is the album thats a standout he tried to go commercial with oxymoron and deviated from his normal self all of his other albums have a consistent theme except oxymoron oxymoron is the one album thats not representative of schoolboy q
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think it has to do with its replayability rodeo just took over my rotation for two semesters
hiphopheads,not_removed,well lets take a look at habits you have sacriligous a really sobering and interesting song then there he go and hands on the wheel both super party songs then sex drive which is literally just about fucking oxy music which is a song about some of the imagery and lifestyles of someone selling and doing drugs my hatin joint which is just basically braggadocious rap raymond as you pointed out about him getting into drug dealing sexting which is literally about him sexting and fucking some girls grooveline which is more braggadocious rap and talking about how hes super awesome gangsta in designer which is about bitches and designer brand productshow we feeling which is expertly summarized by the chorus house full of money tub full of bitches we be sexing all night give yo ass the buisiness druggys wit hoes not much to say here him and soulo going in about how much drugs they take and how many bitches they fuck nightmare on figg street which you left out as one of the most interesting songs on here talking about how real it is on the streets and how some people seemed to have forgotten that in their luxury lives my homie you again pointed out very intricate track about one of your friends being a snitch and the feelings that go along with that blessed of course being a super sober and personal song about grief and loss and sympathy with your friends niggas already know which talks about how everyone knows who schoolboy q is and raw where he and jay rock talk about how real they are
hiphopheads,not_removed,and thats literally what schoolboy embodies hes a modern day gangsta rapper and he fools occasionally and thats why people love setbacks h and c and blank face oxymoron is party track after party track and not necessarily as well done as h and c or blank face w that schoolboy grit man of the year collard greens studio hell of a night what they want has a chainz feature ffs you cant get more casual than that and then when he tried to get deep it was a kendrick imitation done nowhere as good
hiphopheads,not_removed,then there is oxymoron you have gangsta and los awesome and collard greens songs that dont really delve into anything and are just really catchy songs to start the album off with but the one thing they do have in common is being in the life of a gangster what they want a song with chainz which starts the strong and more dark theme of selling drugs on the street and the lifestyle accompanied with that studio is like literally the biggest mainstream appeal song he has and almost single handidly destroys my entire argument hoover street and oxymoron then take you into the life of a drug dealer all the ins and outs and the making of one starting with when they were young and the influences the gang culture had on them even then and how shitty things were so they were willing to do any and everythng to make money to not live like that i hate the purge and i never really listen to it so i cant speak to its lyrical content blind threats does what sacriligous does but even better it takes the message of religion questions it then reminds everyone that sometimes you dont have time to sit and wait for god to make things better you have to do it yourself hell of a night is a party song no question break the bank is a reminder to everyone making the come up that they could make it at any time almost a positive song saying hey this shit is fucked up but if we keep working in a positive way it might pay off man of the year is either a party song or a parody of party songs depending on how you view it i think its a party song and a mainstream one at that not taking into account the bonus content on oxy because it is just that bonus content
hiphopheads,not_removed,so while you might still think habits is more relatablepersonalwhatever because it has more songs with substance than oxy sure go ahead but the overall themes and messages you get from oxy especially the vibe make sit feel more cohesive and some of the lyrics get extremely vivid and detailed which was absent on a lot of habits but yes to answer your question i do listen to habits quite a lot
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn who is this guy
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is on the favorites list

hiphopheads,not_removed,drake acting like the richest groupie rn
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn drake really loves this dude whenever i scroll through instagram its not unusual to see that he liked one of his pictures must have big plans
hiphopheads,not_removed,nonewfriends
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmfaooooo drake literally cannot do a damn thing without yall taking mad shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,buying loyalty eh
hiphopheads,not_removed,whos paying the insurance
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake is such a snake and savage is dumb for falling for this i mean its a smart move he does something for you a feature on your debut a cosign buys you a ferrari etc then you owe him and the moment any beef starts he can just pull this out and shit all over you hes like a human recordlabel hes not the only one to do it either but damn he does it more than anyone edit i keep forgetting just how many drake stans are in this sub lord dont agree with me then move on but its not like drake didnt do the exact shit im talking about to meek and mentioned it in charged up edit i swear every time i get done with a set of comments and refresh my inbox says you stans got good coordination ill give you that
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake papi af
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant help but feel cynical when drake does something like this as if hes trying to prove something whenever he puts himself in the trap scene by remixing a migos track making a tape with future etc
hiphopheads,not_removed,the way people on this sub make it seem drake is fucking lex luthor lmao who are you to say what relationship they have or his intentions
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake probably begging him to join ovo 😂😂😂
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake want savage on his side when pusha starts clappin ps we have a savage flair yet

hiphopheads,not_removed,imma just say it seems kinda gay also whats up with drizzy savage really murders people why drizzy trying to court this dude

hiphopheads,not_removed,any actual proof or we just taking this twitter accounts word for it
hiphopheads,not_removed,couldnt afford a new ferrari drake fuck your used its buy me a at least only car people will understand this comment
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake isnt conscious of making monsters out of the rappers he sponsors till it all goes bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn is spoiled
hiphopheads,not_removed,drizzy taught me
hiphopheads,not_removed,glucose guardian
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey drake its me the newest trend s
hiphopheads,not_removed,its like rhiphopsubredditsimulator
hiphopheads,not_removed,i am bamboozled because my closest friends cant even give me for gas without whining and gets a fucking car from rentahomie drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,ferrari endorsed a rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,why do i doubt ferrari would release a fucking ovo branded car ovos a cool brand and its definitely high end but still ferrari doesnt do shit like that no way that happened
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao imagine savage doing a song with majid
hiphopheads,not_removed,otherwise
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes screaming fuck a deal
hiphopheads,not_removed,tryin to buy loyalty
hiphopheads,not_removed,party just dipped off in a white porsche
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpspbstwimgcommediabkoexgdcyaawywjpg
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake or kylie
hiphopheads,not_removed,i bought my friend an arizona for his bday
hiphopheads,not_removed,i stole my friend a traffic cone for his birthday
hiphopheads,not_removed,made my boy a cake smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,didnt sneakin drop before
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake dropped a song with before dropped
hiphopheads,not_removed,no question that was my initial thought as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake knows hip hop hes known of for a while now
hiphopheads,not_removed,tbh think he got wind of the feature
hiphopheads,not_removed,he always does weird shit like this though remember when he knew skepta for like a week and got a bbk tattoo drake gets called a culture vulture but he throws out so many cosigns and does stuff like this to bring up lesser known acts all the time
hiphopheads,not_removed,except they have known each other for a bit you can find videos of drake metrobooming listening to music before it exploded
hiphopheads,not_removed,im good
hiphopheads,not_removed,he tagged him in the post dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol drakes fetish is courting the scariest looking motherfuckers in hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake really loves this dude must have big plans choose one
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely dont like drake but i dont think that every nicety he does has to be some power play to establish dominance
hiphopheads,not_removed,at this point in his career im sure savage would prefer a ferrari than risking the chance to be a pawn in drakes hypothetical scheme to take over the rap game
hiphopheads,not_removed,im confused drake is a snake for buying this man a motherfucking rari and savage is dumb for accepting drakes gift which is a motherfucking rari whats he gonna do tell drake to get bent why does everything drake does have to be so diabolical to some people
hiphopheads,not_removed,potentially losing a beef with savage a relative nobody is not worth that much in time and money to drake the saner conclusion is that drake wants to sign savage to a really shitty label deal
hiphopheads,not_removed,did drake fuck your girl geez man not everything drake does is some sinister plot
hiphopheads,not_removed,what drake can pull out what
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not on anyones side but its so stupid to say dont agree with me then move on like why even make a comment on a discussion forum and then complain about people responding
hiphopheads,not_removed,this some tin foil hat shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo you projecting did something happen to you
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not seeing any negatives here sounds like a solid deal where can i sign up
hiphopheads,not_removed,reminds me when wayne was talking about leaving cash money and birdman gave a mil in cash and a new car
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres a lot of dumb shit posted on here but damn someone always able to top it good job you got comments in here arguing over something completely pointless that nobody should care about seriously
hiphopheads,not_removed,it takes away from drakes authenticity as an artist hes a fucking popstarhiphops very own version of taylor swift with her girl squad
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake stans out in full force here i feel for you
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean surely potentially having one nice line in a beef that likely wont happen isnt worth to drake thats clearly not his motivation perhaps he wants to sign him but that doesnt really make this a snake move
hiphopheads,not_removed,learnt it from his daddy birdman
hiphopheads,not_removed,only on hhh would you see drake doing something be turned into a hate fest
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmfao so true
hiphopheads,not_removed,check instagram
hiphopheads,not_removed,the twitter account posted proof which is ig post
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shut up
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake is a rapper you might know him from digrassi as wheelchair jimmy
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,issa
hiphopheads,not_removed,what the fuck is wrong with you
hiphopheads,not_removed,he gonna fuck yo bitch in it
hiphopheads,not_removed,savage came over yeah we threw a party
hiphopheads,not_removed,da child in da middle of a divorce drake meek
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake issa wife
hiphopheads,not_removed,s isnt even needed i really believe thats drakes tactic
hiphopheads,not_removed,ya i saw this meme too bruhbruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,tbh your friends probably dont have net worth of mil
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably a dealership not ferrari themselves
hiphopheads,not_removed,highly doubt it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think theyre releasing them ferrari just painted ovo on the cars and gave them to drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,no way nope nuh uh ferrari working with a multimillion dollar professional recording artist no way you some kid on reddit knows for sure that it didnt happen nope wrap it the fuck up this guy knows it didnt happen
hiphopheads,not_removed,him rapping over a type ethereal beat could be sick actually haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,fredo was in the hold on were going home video
hiphopheads,not_removed,the madman
hiphopheads,not_removed,rmadlads
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah they got majid jordan taking turns on the hamster wheel that powers the ac
hiphopheads,not_removed,the price is on the can tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,i found aa batteries for my friends birthday
hiphopheads,not_removed,i bought my friend a take for his b day and i ended up eating half of it before i gave it to him
hiphopheads,not_removed,someone gave me one for free randomly just put it in my dorm without telling me who he or she was
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats prob a huge example of culture vulture tbh and its weird af
hiphopheads,not_removed,he knew skepta a while before he got the bbk tat
hiphopheads,not_removed,links
hiphopheads,not_removed,so how come he bought a rari out of all people
hiphopheads,not_removed,really you dont wish you had a ferrari from drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,sounds like a marriage
hiphopheads,not_removed,not every one but i dont think its a coincidence hes on almost every and up freshmans debut
hiphopheads,not_removed,really buying a rapper you have no real relation with a ferrari isnt ever just being nice
hiphopheads,not_removed,being gifted a ferrari is like something a rapper does to some model hes trying to bag and you dont have to believe in some scheme to see drake is a culturevulture who uses new artist to his advantage
hiphopheads,not_removed,niggas really out here thinking people cant be good friends
hiphopheads,not_removed,rari really
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy fucking shit just spell out ferrari you clown
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao forreal
hiphopheads,not_removed,im more wondering what he did to stans like you that gets yall so offended at any mention of his name in a not positive light
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not mutually exclusive and savage is far from a nobody hes actually on the cusp of getting mainstream success which is why drake would even want to sign him or pay attention to him in the first place
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know but i know he must of gave it to you good to make you rush to his defense like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,pull out the fact he did basically bigged you up when you were noone
hiphopheads,not_removed,i get that but people are getting so mad about it like if my opinion on a massive artist neither of us has any ties in makes you that upset then just move along itll be better for their health
hiphopheads,not_removed,done doing favors for people cause it aint like i need the money i make off a feature i see you niggas having trouble going gold turning into some so and sos that no one knows okay then
hiphopheads,not_removed,yup you got me definitely projecting because its not like drake did the exact thing i said with meek
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly
hiphopheads,not_removed,except drake isnt robbing
hiphopheads,not_removed,for real he is literally raps taylor swift to a tee
hiphopheads,not_removed,no doubt that he did
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah lol i think i committed blasphemy in their eyes
hiphopheads,not_removed,really got me with that one man and bolded for emphasize wow next time you should try all caps i think itll fit your persona even better
hiphopheads,not_removed,not mutuality exclusive plus its more than just a line its a bigdog lilbro move
hiphopheads,not_removed,sure did
hiphopheads,not_removed,see you in days
hiphopheads,not_removed,talk to him please he just bought you a ferrari
hiphopheads,not_removed,s was to avoid the hate from drake stans and let em know issa joke
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean he came up under wayne of course hes gonna try to make himself ubiquitous
hiphopheads,not_removed,other rappers collaborate all the time but if drake does it he is jacking a wave i really dont get it
hiphopheads,not_removed,something something drake a wave rider somethin lol karma fiend
hiphopheads,not_removed,this nigga was gifted fucking ferraris with his name on it for no reason
hiphopheads,not_removed,well then i was wrong but its not really a colab its more just a ferrari with an owl printed in a few spots but good for drake i guess
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao stfu all i said is that ferrari doesnt do stuff like that no need to be a condescending douchebag about it ferrari is an incredibly high end brand they dont do collabs like fucking supreme or bape or some shit you know how hard it is to even get a brand new ferrari sure drake can buy one but why the fuck would they taint their historic iconic luxurious image with a fucking owl only collab type deal they have is that puma produces their apparel but theres no puma branded car as far as i know maybe im wrong im just saying ferrari hasnt collabed with any of their big name customers until now so why the fuck would they start with drake go be a dick somewhere else
hiphopheads,not_removed,ocean drive was kinda ethereal so i could totally see this working
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would love to see doing some cloud rap
hiphopheads,not_removed,for a second i thought you meant ethereal from awful records someone yall should check out if you already havent
hiphopheads,not_removed,we still gotta find that one escaped hamster from a while back i think his name was the weekdays or something like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,pre dumped swishas
hiphopheads,not_removed,im broke as shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,is your friend a vibrator
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was posted but the link died its reposted other places metroboomin has too much crap to look through on the gram for me to search through though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont wish i had to experience the deaths of family and friends
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh definitely i think the dude likes to pump and dump new wave rappers so he can always stay relevant for sure but at the same time it can benefit them as well those dudes still said yes to him being a feature on the song know what i mean
hiphopheads,not_removed,every and up freshman debut wanna give some names
hiphopheads,not_removed,how do you know their relationship lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,they have a relationship drake got him ovo jordans in the summer
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hate drake too but savage can take the car and walk away or milk drake to get his name bigger he wont contractually owe drake anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean i guess none of that makes any difference in my life tho so i dont see why it bothers you so much
hiphopheads,not_removed,the culture vulture thing is the most played out meme here
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think savage definitely benefits more here
hiphopheads,not_removed,game did it to diddy tho its just repsect bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just dont understand how people twist everything drake does into some moustachetwisting plot on his part like what evil motives can he have behind buying a dude a ferrari or featuring on his friends songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah drake just happens to be good friends with every rapper that becomes relevant
hiphopheads,not_removed,you really think drake and savage have known each other long enough to be good friends good enough friends that drakell just buy the guy a rari out of the kindness of his heart sure thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,its on purpose right is he not trolling
hiphopheads,not_removed,yall so offended at any mention of his name in a not positive light although this is true most of the time what youre saying just sounds so dumb and out of nowhere so i think thats why youre getting shit on
hiphopheads,not_removed,savage gonna fall outta relevancy faster than fetty wap and you making it seem like this the biggest move of
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah it was lit had a sum wit drake and your girl ask coach k n orlando
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes done that for so many artists already and has never done that once so why would he with
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre saying he bought someone a ferrari so he could have a few extra bars in his arsenal
hiphopheads,not_removed,are they getting mad all ive seen is reasonable responses no personal insults or anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,so youre telling me you believe that drake has bought a ferrari so he would have a couple bars to use against dude if any beef were to go down okay then
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek has been in the rap game for a long fuckin time lol i remember being in high school and seeing that freestyle vid he did when he was drake definitely did not scoop him up
hiphopheads,not_removed,you think that savage is going to get salty that drake didnt tweet his album like a insecure little bitch
hiphopheads,not_removed,plus its more than just a line its a bigdog lilbro move so that he can use it as a line in a diss like you said right not sure how this is worth close to to anyone its probably to help convince him to sign but the theory that he is using this for diss purposes is crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,one of his songs has million views on youtube hes collaborated with both drake and meek mill as well as future he has a whole collaborative ep with metro boomin who is one of the best known trap producers at the moment hes not unknown youre just out of the loop lol i probably just fell for bait
hiphopheads,not_removed,google is free bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,couldnt you look him up
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres this really cool new site out there called google you should try it
hiphopheads,not_removed,obi a safe mod but this shit unreal
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay if you dont like his music but dont wish bad shit on him
hiphopheads,not_removed,is this a lyric thread
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn bro was that your new word of the day
hiphopheads,not_removed,buying someone a ferrari is a bit more than just collaborating i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel you but drake is the only one i can think of that does it with almost every new trendy rapper savage fetty wap metro boomin future when he was really popping off makonnen etc
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i really care about internet points man im just expressing my opinion on modern hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is like that sopranos episode where christopher gets pissed at how much free shit celeb multimillionaires get
hiphopheads,not_removed,aint no reason drake been poppin
hiphopheads,not_removed,why are we shouting
hiphopheads,not_removed,well the info is that ferrari sponsors drake and it says that they gave him four ovo branded ferraris so idk why you doubt it based on what you think the company would and wouldnt do lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol maybe your hatred for drake and his standings on the reddit hiphop community seems to make you forget he is an extremely respected artist to tons of other people you never know what kind of connections a multi platinum album artist has
hiphopheads,not_removed,s a v a g e a d b o y s
hiphopheads,not_removed,that would be xavier wulf
hiphopheads,not_removed,ovean drive and feel it are pretty damn close
hiphopheads,not_removed,ethereal is an amazing producer i even love his instrumentals plus he can rap with the best of them
hiphopheads,not_removed,weekdys
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think he changed his name to constellationman
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wish
hiphopheads,not_removed,he is now
hiphopheads,not_removed,this
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah for sure it helps them both but in the long run it gives drake a leg up on them
hiphopheads,not_removed,i said almost every and here you go jcole kendrick aap rocky meek mill migos future fetty wap yg
hiphopheads,not_removed,you as a grown man would by another grown man a ferrari for funsies
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol this fake ignorant shit is so annoying oh u dont know they werent friends before they were famous man drake probably didnt even know who the fuck savage was a year ago and they likely havent met in person more then a single time he bought him a ferrari because drake and his massive team of people know that can be huge one day and drake intends on staying at the top of the rap game making friends in high places is how you do that its fucking simple dont act stupid if they actually were just friends drake would take him out to bars and theyd hang out not buy him an expensive ass car
hiphopheads,not_removed,savage just became relevant in the last year its not like drake knew him anytime before then awful short time to become such good buddies
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow he didnt just get him a ferrari he also got him some jordans they must be real friends
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh that explains a lot kappa
hiphopheads,not_removed,because they arent
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake bought it for me but it still mine
hiphopheads,not_removed,not contractually but it gives drake the ability to basically say bought a broke nigga a ferrari like he was my bitch or some shit like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a fact tho he did with all the artist ive named several times on here come on migos dram the whole fakejamaican voice and now savage dude takes from everybody
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah for now
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk about that but diddy is way richer than the game and was way richer before the game ever got big so thats a different circumstance entirely and the game doesnt have a history at least that i know of him doing this type of thing to plenty of smaller artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,its bugged when listens to his own shit or freestyles in the car drake takes the lyrics wake up sheeple
hiphopheads,not_removed,do you know how much drake makes do you really think this is that big of a deal to him this is probably worth show lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,no unfortunately not
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not it you can say positive things about drake all day and never get called a stan but when someone says anything negative about him and you rush to his defense and try to shit on the person youre a stan
hiphopheads,not_removed,how nobody noticed yet that drake hops on almost every new rappers debut album jcole kendrick aap rocky meek mill migos future etc the list goes on and on its not hard to see edit fetty wap yg
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think its sound dumb at allpeople have accused drake of using these young rappers at his adavantage biting their flows and shit sounds like a move and i wouldnt be surprise it is especially considering is on
hiphopheads,not_removed,not a big assumption pretty simple to see actually ill quote my other comment how nobody noticed yet that drake hops on almost every new rappers debut album jcole kendrick aap rocky meek mill migos future etc the list goes on and on its not hard to see edit fetty wap yg
hiphopheads,not_removed,fetty wap isnt completely irrelevant its just ridiculously difficult to reach the heights he did with trap queen my way and wake up and different now are songs that arent really getting mainstream success but are still pretty popular savage isnt falling out of relevancy anytime soon either savage mode was a great tape and his feature on both meek and drakes tracks were dope hes on the cusp of being that next mainstream trap rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,where did i say it was the biggest move its just another culturevulture move like the rest
hiphopheads,not_removed,leave me out of your fantasies man lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,done doing favors for people cause it aint like i need the money i make off a feature i see you niggas having trouble going gold turning into some so and sos that no one knows never done that once
hiphopheads,not_removed,one part of it yeah another is probably to try to pull savage to ovo either way i doubt it was just kindness not like they go way back
hiphopheads,not_removed,people dont flood your inbox this hard without being a little mad or finding out the user is a woman
hiphopheads,not_removed,not just that no probably to lure him to ovo too its the type of shit record labels do give you a gift to bring you in but also say you owe them if you turn away
hiphopheads,not_removed,but he didnt get mainstream popular and the average person didnt even know who he was til his debut album which drake always makes sure to hope on with young new artists
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not what hes saying
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao i imagine everything you write in hannibals voice and chuckle
hiphopheads,not_removed,insecure little bitch lmao why are you so mad though
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not and i again not just for diss purposes its just a power play but you obviously dont get it and dont want to so here you go drake just gave savage the ferrari out the kindness of his sweet little heart because him and savage are such close friends
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol i probably just fell for bait these bait comments are never funny anyway they just mad aggy
hiphopheads,not_removed,hed rather brag about his ignorance
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude was just on stage laughing at the fact that his boy killed bankroll fresh so nah i would be all good with that
hiphopheads,not_removed,were doing marvins room about savages room
hiphopheads,not_removed,found the guy with a low sat score
hiphopheads,not_removed,its buying a present for a friend whats wrong with that
hiphopheads,not_removed,these dudes are so fucking filthy rich that this shit isnt that surprising
hiphopheads,not_removed,future and drake have been tight since before future blew up also im sure the other people ask drake too fetty and everyone else have collaborated with so many artists i dont get how you can say that
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant forget migos versace versace
hiphopheads,not_removed,what the fuck are you talking about i fucking love drake i think hes an amazing artist headlines and hyfr and successful and forever and the motto and miss me got me through highschool that has nothing to do with it though drake is a respectable artist filthy frank is a respectable youtuber but ferrari aint collaborating with him either man fuck off with these silly assumptions
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just started listening to him and im loving all his projects so far
hiphopheads,not_removed,a ferrari though
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks for the gold kind stranger
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay pretty much all of those artists came up at the same time as drake drake was a still a rising artist in drake has always been a hot feature he wasnt even on some of those debuts ie finally famous or fetty wap
hiphopheads,not_removed,hah thats no where close to every you just listed some of the biggest rappers over the past couple years all who have been featured on each other songs yet drake collaborating with them is some plot lol chill
hiphopheads,not_removed,if i as a grown man was worth over i wouldnt sweat it too much over giving a friend a gift
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol im just saying this relationship didnt start a week ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,and it lets savage say took your ferrari and never answered your calls again even if drake says what you said everyone would just laugh at drake buying dude a ferrari
hiphopheads,not_removed,then he replies saying drake is a male groupie
hiphopheads,not_removed,how is featuring on a song being a culture vulture and smh at people who arent from toronto thinking they know anything about our city and how people speak here
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre right man drakes just doing this because hes such a nice guy
hiphopheads,not_removed,has it occurred to you that all of those rappers know the benefits of having drake the hottest rapper in the game on their debut records its arguably the best thing that can happen to you early on in your career if youre looking to be commercially successful
hiphopheads,not_removed,boats may have been his debut album but he was far from a new rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,chainz new rapper i hate this sub sometimes
hiphopheads,not_removed,you could say the same shit about kanye except kanye has whatever hot new rapper on his album also drake wasnt on a big sean album until dark sky paradise and was never on a migos album
hiphopheads,not_removed,why is that a sin drake is waynes protégé you know how many features wayne has done since when is doing features a bad thing did drake murder your family dog
hiphopheads,not_removed,jcole drake wasnt even that big at that point kendrick kendrick faetured on drakes album first aap rocky and they continue to work together to this day meek mill theyd collabed on multiple previous occasions migos wasnt on the album future they still work together they tour together write for kanye together drop tapes together chainz was more established than drake at that point fetty wap wasnt on the album yg yet another good relationship
hiphopheads,not_removed,andre does the same thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,btw drake wasnt on migoss debut
hiphopheads,not_removed,who really cares tho like sure i guess some people care if someone is biting another artist but this dude is acting like his life is in shambles because drake gave a ferrari like my dude r e l a x
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay so hes looking out for his career wow what a little bitch right i dont even fuck with drakes music but his haters are a lot worse than his stans
hiphopheads,not_removed,you nitpicked a line that wasnt aimed at anyone specific and a line from a diss track
hiphopheads,not_removed,also i bout this one a purse i bout this one a truck i bout this one a purse i bout this one a mall i keep buying shit make sure you keep track of it all
hiphopheads,not_removed,but when has he pulled up the fact that he bigged someone up in order to get something from them
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats wrong with a young artist paying drake for a feature and drake accepting
hiphopheads,not_removed,why is this a bad thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love meek think he won that beef and still think getting mad over an album tweet is corny as fuck how the fuck you gonna suddenly expose someone for being fake for using ghostwriters when youre admitting that you care so much about publicity a working relationship aint worth it if you dont get the hashtags
hiphopheads,not_removed,pot meet kettle
hiphopheads,not_removed,i never said that was why just that it had nothing to do with him using it for a potential future diss track
hiphopheads,not_removed,jesus thats fucked up
hiphopheads,not_removed,are adlibs lyrics cuz everyone posting and stuff is spammy but i love those threads haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,hah jokes on you i dropped out of school when i was
hiphopheads,not_removed,if drake never blew up him n savage wouldnt run in the same circles lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,savage isnt that rich at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,he says it because its true populartrending new sound you better believe drake is hopping all over the remix versacemigos tuesdaymakonnen and my wayfetty wap are three examples among many
hiphopheads,not_removed,cause they haters who hate people at the top
hiphopheads,not_removed,so even tho savages camp already came out and stated what happened and the ovo ferrari story is true you still deny it for what reason
hiphopheads,not_removed,plus i dont want that damn tattoo on my forehead
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck the ferrari though
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake was a still a rising artist in ugh no he had a huge mixtape cosign and a gold debut album by then drake has always been a hot feature so are plenty of other artists he wasnt even on some of those debuts ie finally famous or fetty wap youre right about big sean i got confused i took it off but my way was on fettys debut and he remixed that so im gonna keep that one on
hiphopheads,not_removed,hah thats no where close to every you just listed some of the biggest rappers over the past couple years no duh thats the point he gets on good artist shit right before they blow and guess what none of those artist are on all of the others albums but drake its not a plot its just moves jay used to do similar shady shit back in the day drake just did more
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a well known fact that the tip to stay rich is to spend on gifts all the time and not sweat it or expect anything in return
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean how the fuck would drake and be friends from different parts of the world have history and dont seem like similar people at all its literally as simple as has potentiol to be huge drake hits him up to be there from the start
hiphopheads,not_removed,look i dont even like drake like that and i know he would easily win that beef all hed have to say would be tossed one of my raris to one of them starvin artist with some other things and thered be nothing for savage to say
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah drake could easily win that one
hiphopheads,not_removed,featuring on a song what he stole their flow which they didnt invent but repopularized and he capitalized off it he stole drams whole fucking song then admitted it and said riddim as his fucking defense come on now guys a vulture
hiphopheads,not_removed,can you point out where i said that please
hiphopheads,not_removed,jesus christ what tf did drake do to you the dude didnt say anything about drake okay
hiphopheads,not_removed,jayelect is now insulting op because of his comment about drake jayelect is a massive stan
hiphopheads,not_removed,has it occurred to you that drake isnt just doing this shit out of the kindness of his heart
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats true but it still doesnt exclude the fact hes on all their debut albums also that was the first time he reemerged as chainz away from tity boi along with it being his solo debut
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah he wasnt hot yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean when he was new ie on his solo debut like every other artist i listed drake hopped on the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,but kanye isnt one every one of their albums and theyre not every one of them is on his kanye hasnt worked with several of those people and youre right about big sean i made a mistake and took him off but versace was a single for yung rich nation
hiphopheads,not_removed,except any rapper would kill to be on a kanye album and rappers on kanyes album become popular
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow murdered my family dog really got me there man anyway wayne didnt hop on almost every freshmans debut in his time and even if he had that doesnt justify anything drake is a wellknown culturevulture get over it
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake wasnt even that big at that point drake had a big mixtape and a gold debut album he was big kendrick featured on drakes album first which drake asked him to do so whats your point and they continue to work together to this day and theyd collabed on multiple previous occasions and it doesnt matter he still hopped on the debut when wasnt on the album was on versace which was the biggest single from their debut album so its all the same they still work together they tour together write for kanye together drop tapes together lmao for the time and lol doesnt take away from my point at all chainz was more established than drake at that point was not more mainstream or popular at that point than drake by a long shot and was not established as a solo artist at all at the time so false wasnt on the album again was on one of the biggest singles from the album so its all the same yet another good relationship lmfao for the and final time and lol wtf does that have to do with anything the moment yg says something bad or does something drake doesnt like hell come out with a i bigged you up when you were nothing type line just like he did with meek come on man try harder
hiphopheads,not_removed,where
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was on their biggest single from their debut album same thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really dont get the life in shambles part of his post tho like at all he even said it was smart
hiphopheads,not_removed,when did i say he was a sociopath lol and with being on all these new rappers debuts along with being a wellknown culture vulture it doesnt take much to add to see hes not doing this shit for the kindness of it he basically said it in charge up for christ sakes
hiphopheads,not_removed,boi you jumping to conclusions
hiphopheads,not_removed,you can look out for your career without being a culturevulture
hiphopheads,not_removed,doesnt matter that its from a diss track thats my point the moment he doesnt like you anymore hell diss you with i put you on type shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats prolly about girls
hiphopheads,not_removed,you think hes talking about buying purses for male rappers lmaoooo
hiphopheads,not_removed,next is gonna be i bout this one a rari
hiphopheads,not_removed,this line is about girls rofl
hiphopheads,not_removed,i never said it was to get something from them just to diss and hold it over them
hiphopheads,not_removed,not all the artist came to drake he came to then a lot of the times
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive explained it a ton of times man he uses it after to shit on you and hes also a culturevulture
hiphopheads,not_removed,where am i mad at though
hiphopheads,not_removed,they can take away our bars but they cant take away our graaahs
hiphopheads,not_removed,my idol
hiphopheads,not_removed,no shit if drake never blew up he wouldnt be buying him a ferrari neither
hiphopheads,not_removed,but whats wrong with remixing thats a completely normal thing to do to remix hot songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes he is the only person to remix those songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt deny it i admitted i was wrong in another comment well not really wrong they released a car with like an owl on the carpet and some stuff like that no serious ovo branding on the outside of the car so really its just a normal ferrari pretty much but yeah the fact that they did it doesnt mean its isnt something unusual for them to do
hiphopheads,not_removed,issa knife
hiphopheads,not_removed,can you explain why putting on new artists that he thinks are talented is a bad thing literally all of these artists benefited from having him on the record and are doing well now
hiphopheads,not_removed,i guess i didnt realize how big thank me later was either way drake has been the hot feature for a minute tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,ugh no he had a huge mixtape cosign and a gold debut album by then he was and had been in the game for like two years lmao definitely not a position to deviously play all these new rappers for his own benefit god damn you drake haters with turn anything against him
hiphopheads,not_removed,you sound confuse plenty of those guys you listed have various songs and even possible mixtapes together thats not something that can be debated and again those few rappers you listed are no where almost every freshmen rappers that made list and again this can also not be debated every freshmen rapper since would be a long list the vast majority drake has never collaborated with
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes still got money rolling in every day hes probably made that back already if not more you must also not be able to grasp how much is its probably like most people giving somebody a gift who said he does this all the time too
hiphopheads,not_removed,tossed one of my raris to one of them starvin artist bought a broke nigga a ferrari like he was bitch lmfao im cryin i actually want this diss to happen
hiphopheads,not_removed,sorry dude youre wrong and wayyyyy overreacting savage can tell him to fuck off and hell be fine the chance of drake saying that are extremely slim
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont see why buying a ferrari for a young artist youve been working with a lot is seen as such a bad thing cant it be that he that he just appreciates what savage is doing and would like to build a relationship with the dude every move drake makes gets shit on in this sub he could donate mil to schools in africa and yall would say hes trying to ride akons wave and hes a culture vulture for it
hiphopheads,not_removed,he used their flow on their song fuck man game must be the biggest culture vulture ever then because he does this shit all the time but i do think that whole situation was a bit suspect i dont see how any of this has to do with culture at all if you want to accuse him of biting then do that but migos flow and the cha cha beat are not culture
hiphopheads,not_removed,cha cha doesnt sound anything like hotline bling besides the tropical vibe the melody and lyrics are completely different
hiphopheads,not_removed,drakes rap doesnt sound anything like migos and hotline bling sounded completely different from cha cha
hiphopheads,not_removed,im giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming youre implying that since youre either saying that or saying drake just buys everyone ferraris because money isnt a thing to him which is even more retarded
hiphopheads,not_removed,still a winwin tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,where in my comment did i say he was
hiphopheads,not_removed,well no shit who would
hiphopheads,not_removed,chainz has been in the game for a while bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,but versace was a single for yung rich nation it wasnt on the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,so like drake you think a feature on a drake album doesnt help at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil wayne is on the debut of yg chainz rick ross playaz circle lloyd juicy j jay rock gucci mane chamillionaire etc jayz is on the debut of foxy brown another level jermaine dupri timbaland angie martinez pharrell the neptunes beyonce young jeezy bun b kendrick lamar big l mic geronimo lil kim puff daddy mase dj clue ja rule lil cease sauce money ms jade and lupe fiasco theres nothing wrong with being on peoples debuts i listen to a lot of new hip hop and if i was in drakes position id probably collab with a lot of people theres no evidence that hes a culture vulture more than anybody on this subreddit
hiphopheads,not_removed,so drake shouldnt defend himself if someone badmouths him
hiphopheads,not_removed,if he was only using these people to pump and dump them than he wouldnt keep making music with them
hiphopheads,not_removed,he hops on a lot of albums of guys who are starting to pop travis drake future frank
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not on their debut album their biggest single from their debut album was either pipe it up or one time im not sure but my moneys on pipe it up
hiphopheads,not_removed,because he sounds unnecessarily angry about it for no reason
hiphopheads,not_removed,so he should have sat back and taken it
hiphopheads,not_removed,ahhh yes the embodiment of of the femlae gender from the energy video
hiphopheads,not_removed,and when has he done that to anyone specifically
hiphopheads,not_removed,but how is that a bad thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,he uses it after to shit on you how many times has he done this did he provoke it hes also a culturevulture why
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea im sure drake is doing this so if sometime in the future he has a beef with savage he can use this against him god damn dude thats stupid as shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,complaining about drake fans when plenty of non drake fans are calling you crazy writing this whole conspiracy just because drake annoys you
hiphopheads,not_removed,straight up
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol wayne literally remixed dozens of top charting songs on his way to a cemented era of goat work i guess he was just riding a wave when he made the upgrade u freestyle and the throw some ds freestyle drake doesnt even do popular songs he brings underrated music to the mainstream migos is a very popular name now and its not an accident
hiphopheads,not_removed,then your argument is baseless
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah they aint
hiphopheads,not_removed,not the biggest fan of repeatedly getting shot in east atlanta and nearly dying on my birthday i think id pass
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a bad thing because hell do shit like after hes like a record label giving a new artist something to help boost them up then calling it back out later as look at all i did for you plus hes a culturevulture
hiphopheads,not_removed,the fact he was changes nothing he had been in the game for years at the point for a stan you really dont know shit lol i know what i speak on you need to do more research before you start typing
hiphopheads,not_removed,ill repeat none of those artist are on all of the others albums but drake and i never said all the freshmen i said almost all the biggest ones which is true by that long list i put up
hiphopheads,not_removed,shit i forgot the my
hiphopheads,not_removed,no not at all drake could end his career i think we both know that and i dont really like drake and if savage ever went at drake he definitely would
hiphopheads,not_removed,he just appreciates what savage is doing and would like to build a relationship with the dude what is this love and hiphop drake has a history of this shit and hes definitely not doing it out of kindness
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah if the game does it then hes a vulture too the whataboutism in this thread is crazy culturevultures copy what makes a smaller unique artist unique then brands that to their already established bigger audience who dont know about the original which is what drake did multiple times
hiphopheads,not_removed,the rhythm for drams single cha cha loosely recreates timmy thomas single why cant we live together with sound effects from various video games whereas drake who admitted he was inspired by cha cha didnt just hop on drams beat and credit him instead hotline bling directly sampled thomas original record drake found a way to hop on another persons wave without giving credit legally drake hasnt done anything wrong here but ethically its looking a little shady
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes stole the migos flow on several songs and ive explained the cha cha remix thievery a bunch of times so check my comments for that one
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt say that either i said drake makes plenty of money so if he wants to buy a ferrari for someone he can he doesnt need a lifetime commitment of friendship nor does he need to do it out of the kindness of his heart maybe he just wants to flex really though who cares get off the computer and spend your time reading a book instead of posting stupid ass comments go lay down and listen to the new aap tape just quit being a bitch ass hater
hiphopheads,not_removed,the dude didnt say anything about drake he literally mentioned his name ugh okay
hiphopheads,not_removed,until he comes out later and says i made you big
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly so how am i crazy for saying he does this shit as a move dude thinks hes the new jay far from it and jay has been known to make moves like that for decades just never took it so far as to be on every fucking new rappers album
hiphopheads,not_removed,no duh but he was wayyy less popular known as tity boi chainz wasnt even a thing and part of the playaz circle he didnt get mainstream popularity til boats which is when drake hopped on
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah not possible chainz is a years old
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think it still counts it was right at the cusp of their debut into the industry and was a single for their debut album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i do think it would help but lets not act like drake isnt a popstar dude kanyes a legend and has classic albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre reaching with that wayne list but regardless youre just showing how wayne and jay sort of did it too doesnt make it any better jays been accused of that shit for years and all youre doing is proving its probably true drake is a humongous culture vulture look at dram and thats just one case
hiphopheads,not_removed,he shouldnt do shit for someone and then hold it over their head later but thats beside the point that hes just a culturevulture
hiphopheads,not_removed,he pumps and dumps small artist unless they gain some success regardless he still tries to lil bro every upcoming artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,future is part of the dungeon family and when did he work with drake besides that you have named artists
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay their debut single than which versace was httpsenwikipediaorgwikiversacesong that better for you
hiphopheads,not_removed,where is the anger in the post man like he isnt swearing or using caps or calling names he said drake wasnt the only one doing it he just commented the situation lol like i know you said you dont like drake but you sound like you are desperately trying to defend him
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a metaphor and its not a metaphor for being a sociopath backpedaling not doing something out of kindness doesnt mean youre a sociopath youre exaggerating what i said
hiphopheads,not_removed,when did i say he gave a fuck about my opinion the question is do you think i give a fuck about yours if not then why are you commenting and drake could use you as a fluffer on his tour bus in between groupies
hiphopheads,not_removed,never said that i said he does shit for people and then just holds it over their head later which is exactly what he did with meek and hell do the same thing to anyone else if they criticize him or get int a beef
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think its a coincidence he hopped on almost every debut of artists who were likely to become his contemporariescompetition
hiphopheads,not_removed,meek mill comments above come on now
hiphopheads,not_removed,because hes a culturevulture
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive quoted this shit like a million times by now done doing favors for people cause it aint like i need the money i make off a feature i see you niggas having trouble going gold turning into some so and sos that no one knows regardless of if he provoked it it just goes to show thats what hell do the moment you turn against him or say something bad about him and hes a culture vulture because he hopes on new artist waves and steals their uniqueness to use for his own benefit
hiphopheads,not_removed,when did i say thats the only thing hes probably doing it for shit yall get sensitive when people talk about aubrey
hiphopheads,not_removed,what conspiracy lol yall big up what i said then try to act like i said it what i said is not wrong you really dont think if savage and drake beef drake wouldnt use the fact he bought him a ferrari in the exact way i say he will please man this shit is easy
hiphopheads,not_removed,he legit made makonnens entire career man tuesday wasnt popping until drake came in with a verse
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres no argument ferrari made an ovo car i doubt it thats unusual for them to do well they did heres proof oh cool they did still bizarre thats it
hiphopheads,not_removed,serious question can you give me an example of him calling in a favor for someone he helped out a lot i dont really know what you mean tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmaooo that tweet could literally be about anything and anyone for any reason the culture vulture argument makes no sense the guy is bigger than anyone for his own culture please explain how hopping on a remix of equates to him stealing from that culture
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay link me some drake tracks from
hiphopheads,not_removed,not every one but i dont think its a coincidence hes on almost every and up freshmans debut nope you said something different not too long ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,no youre delusional drake hasnt ended anyones career yet ppl who are smart about it like the weeknd have take advantage of drake and kept theri distance drakes snakiness isnt a secret
hiphopheads,not_removed,come the fuck on man a whiny line about buying a ferrari is not going to end his goddamn career x has million plays on spotify you seriously think all his fans are gonna be like welp drake made a negative comment about buying a ferrari never listening to him ever again hell no savage is an xxl freshman has close industry ties with people like future and metro he is going to be absolutely fine dont overestimate drakes power the people drake appeals to and the people appeal to are very different getting year old white girls to say fuck savage isnt going to change the fact that is hot and as long as his music stays high quality hes not going to lose his career especially not over line from drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake has a history of this shit give me an example of him doing favors for someone and then using that to manipulate them later its not like these guys are signing anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,you clearly dont even know what culture means
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao you should be blaming drake for biting timmy thomas then after all he wrote the melody not fucking dram
hiphopheads,not_removed,ahh gotcha so because drake used the same sample hes stealing someone should tell pusha t that travis stole from him with mamacita and someone should tell chance that both chief keef and now aap mob have stolen from him
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea i saw you cha cha post and ill give you that one still dont think people would have made the connection if he didnt originally title it cha cha remix but yea that was kinda lame i will disagree with you on the migos thing he doesnt sound like them at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont understand why he cant express his opinion here about an artist being a hater and expressing an opinon are different haterness implies consistency if this guy has consistently hated on drake then its fair to call this hating otherwise what hes saying is completely legitimate
hiphopheads,not_removed,when has he ever done that
hiphopheads,not_removed,the issue is this has literally never happened lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know why youre acting like that scenarios played out multiple times or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,why are you so angry about it though thats the one part of this im not getting
hiphopheads,not_removed,true i do agree drake is a culture vulture
hiphopheads,not_removed,im
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok and you act like everyone thats ever been on a kanye album is now a superstar
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre reaching with that wayne list i dont think its possible to be reaching all of those are debuts that waynes featured on doesnt even count him hopping on nikes for wale when he was buzzin jays been accused of that shit for years and all youre doing is proving its probably true accused of what shit keeping his ears to the streets adapting doing features isnt a bad thing id say its a good thing i like rappers who do features drake is a humongous culture vulture no hes not humongous culture vulture can you tell me what a culture vulture is is kendrick a culture vulture for doing a track with fredo santana or hopping on classic man or remixing awolnation and tame impala and foster the people or working with yg meek mill and aap rocky at the same exact time drake did
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes never done that and you just keep reusing that dumb meme
hiphopheads,not_removed,rick ross capital cities ilk money as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol real her listen to take care its this alright underground album not many people have heard it
hiphopheads,not_removed,he doesnt even say anything about how he helped meek there
hiphopheads,not_removed,saying he regrets doing him a favor is not holding something over someone in any way plus it was a fucking diss track lmao hes a snake for talking shit to a guy who was trying to end his career you are delusional with hatred for this guy to make stuff like this up
hiphopheads,not_removed,in the end he help put a lot of rappers on or atleast pushstart their career so whats the problem here sure he benefits from it but its a two way street they both get the benefits id love for drake to hop on one of my songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats wrong with adapting himself muscially to what people want to listen to
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know whats supposed to be incriminating there if youre planning on beefing with someone in the future why would you collab with them and hes a culture vulture because he hopes on new artist waves and steals their uniqueness to use for his own benefit what drake album sounds like anyone else id say all drake albums sound like drake he collaborates a lot but other artists clearly benefit more from that than he does seems like he does it mainly because hes a huge hip hop head
hiphopheads,not_removed,you referenced the meek verse as the only time hes done that and you used some cryptic ass tweet
hiphopheads,not_removed,barack gonna drone strike this niggas house
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know theyre like but i always get so uncomfortable watching their videos because they just look way too young to do the stuff they do
hiphopheads,not_removed,obama would make him disappear
hiphopheads,not_removed,why isnt he trynna get with one of the baddies in their music videos edit a word
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably because getting something easy isnt as fun as getting something challenging and powerful
hiphopheads,not_removed,dreezy is dope if you havent heard her collab with gucci that she just put out you need to check it out its great
hiphopheads,not_removed,the gucci collab is dope i also love her track with dej loaf serena her forthcoming full length is going to be pretty hot i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i fucked with that beat switch up so god damn hard but i feel like the album sort of trailed off as it finished sort of fizzled out rather than ending with a bang none of the songs were bad by any means but i wish it wouldve kept the feel all the way through
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was so hyped but it was incredibly average its fine to listen but nothing really stands out i really enjoyed the track with big time watts rip
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just started the album karat jesus definitely wowd me dope as fuck intro edit also the album art for this is hilarious lol really digging the beats so far in this
hiphopheads,not_removed,listening right now and i love it im on amnesia
hiphopheads,not_removed,karat jesus is so fucking good
hiphopheads,not_removed,really good album amnesia and alexys bang hard the lyrics are preety solid that oj simpson line on alexys had me dying overall solid
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo wtf this album is on apple music but isnt even on the new music lists at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,did anyone catch that mike jones line in carat jesus its around seconds in
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant stop listening to amnesia 🔥 🔥
hiphopheads,not_removed,you cant post the initial reactions discussion thread until hours after the album drops you posted this like hours after
hiphopheads,not_removed,fave beat so far a lot of these are surprising me vibing w the vocal tones in phone lit and andrea
hiphopheads,not_removed,my bad dawg
hiphopheads,not_removed,today
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,lets hope
hiphopheads,not_removed,source
hiphopheads,not_removed,wow you really showed him
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol stop being such a loser stan drake doesnt even know that you exist
hiphopheads,not_removed,his discography is solid af hater
hiphopheads,not_removed,of course
hiphopheads,not_removed,listening to ones music and being a fan of ones music is two different things
hiphopheads,not_removed,fiya
hiphopheads,not_removed,it sure is a shame this isnt getting as much traction here this album is really something good esp those who need those jdilla type albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i just got around to this record and its fantastic i think tutankhamen was a bit better but that project was very strong so no shame in that there are some great cuts on here and nothing struck me as a dud during my first few listens
hiphopheads,not_removed,dope song from a dope project ive been listening to comfortzone a lot lately in anticipation for his upcoming tape saba is a really talented artist he kinda reminds me of a young andre in a few ways
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats mc tree up to lately
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really really love saba i didnt know anything about him other than a few of his features until i saw him live earlier this month but ive been playing comfortzone nonstop since im so hyped for the new project hes crazy talented and seems like an awesome guy
hiphopheads,not_removed,same here i just got sooo into him the last few weeks he has a new song called world in my hands on spotify that is greaaaaaaaat too
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn hes been going in with these singles
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really hope this isnt just a generic hype up song like hes been making i want some vintage logic bars over something soulful
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,he said he might make albums one full of bangers and another sort of like up or tits
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok dis hilarious fr tho rest in peace geraldo man
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think of this everytime i see logics name
hiphopheads,not_removed,the itunes version has a different two lines in the intro just thought it was interesting
hiphopheads,not_removed,but for real thats from when he recorded his verse for rap monument dont know who the blonde woman is
hiphopheads,not_removed,nope no fans here hes pretty unpopular
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,my students start singing raindrop drop top during class they act like their student teacher dont know nothing about hip hop smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,their big singles kept em afloat imo launched into stardom with versace and hannah montana first fight night pipe it up handsome and wealthy were like the first wave after that you can probably throw bitch dab in there but it only got like hits on yt while their big stuff got at least one time say sum and cocoon all got big and had pretty popping music videos then bad and boujee got big quavo also had some good features on stuff during that time pick up the phone and oh my dis side were both pretty poppin too he was also on champions with good music which was pretty big also people actually kinda liked their mixtapesalbums even though they were never huge enough to have a vaguely cult following because they make so much turn up music people are just kind of down with the migos regardless
hiphopheads,not_removed,meme power the whole raindrop drop top bs gave them enough visibility for their song to be recognized in the main stream
hiphopheads,not_removed,versace versace versace versace
hiphopheads,not_removed,they were on after they released versace
hiphopheads,not_removed,versace hannah montana china town to fight night handsome and wealthy to pipe it up spray the champaign to look at my dab say sum to bad and boujee call cast tshirt kelly price honestlythey never died off with their singles every year they had singles i think that memes really impact songs more now uzi also had hype and the song is very melodic and sounds different than theyre other songs theyve definitely matured their sound and improved lyrics quavo also had been working heavily solo and had that interest from people too hes kinda part of travis clique now too i honestly think the song was bound for some sort of success but they also capitalized off of it and made a much much much bigger splash legal issues didnt seem to get in the way because they came up with legal issues so it was surprising along the way
hiphopheads,not_removed,xanax
hiphopheads,not_removed,when they met jim harbaugh at michigan
hiphopheads,not_removed,made good music with consistency
hiphopheads,not_removed,get em teach
hiphopheads,not_removed,been a minute since iv heard fight night gotta listen to that tape again
hiphopheads,not_removed,you can probably throw bitch dab in there but it only got like hits on yt while their big stuff got at least theyre the ones who made dabbing as popular as it became through that song so id definitely include it made much bigger waves than handsome and wealthy
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is pretty accurate theyve always been pretty big down in atlanta and got played all the time and had a pretty straightforward rise without losing any steam their last year to heavy mainstream has been a combination of being everywhere in music dabbing and bad and boujee and the media picking them up
hiphopheads,not_removed,good point do you think quavos rise as a solofeature artist also propelled the group
hiphopheads,not_removed,i tell them i knew who migos was before you little kids could pronounce bad and boulje
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah lol migos are coming to my hometown this summer and of ppl i know referred to them as he so i dont think the general population is aware that quavo is a migo
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha we should do an experiment to see how many firsttime migos listeners can accurately guess the amount of members in the group
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean is takeoff even in the group anymore
hiphopheads,not_removed,my two roommates just found out theres of them and that quavo is part of migos i was driving the other day and just understood their name migos amigos fuckin blew my mind
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruh he had the hardest bars on culture
hiphopheads,not_removed,bpt in a nutshell
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought offset went to jail did takeoff also spend time in prison
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know but i feel like hes left out of a lot of songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes not into doing features i heard he likes to stick by the usual crew
hiphopheads,not_removed,i guess thats fair
hiphopheads,not_removed,took a history of hiphop course with wonder as my professor in college just last year these were the assigned texts race reform and rebellion the second reconstruction and beyond in black america —manning marable thats the joint the hiphop studies reader ed —ed by murray forman mark anthony neal hiphop revolution the culture and politics of rap —jeffrey o g ogbar the hip hop wars what we talk about when we talk about hip hop —and why it matters—tricia rose
hiphopheads,not_removed,bad tag this came out a year ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,second from the right is mixedbyali to kendricks right looks like flylo i dont theink the rest are anybody important probably just his homies i was doing the same thing with the tpab cover when it came out but that ended up being no one famous either edit or do you think they are trying to look like these artists thats an interesting take
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah thats what it looks like to me as well i saw the future lookalike and great value j cole and thats what i thought immediately
hiphopheads,not_removed,im pretty sure these are kendricks homies mackwops there and jay rock is on his right even with the obvious last supper allusion i dont understand how the painting portrays the idea that his fellow disciples should be parodies if kendrick is living out his last supper im sure he would want his homies there instead of actors portraying other rappers also kendrick is pretty cool with j cole and q why would he be mocking them
hiphopheads,not_removed,those are literally people kendrick knows not rappers hes parodying lmfao mackwop and jay rock on his left ali is on his right hes not parodying anyone if he wanted scholboy q hed put the real schoolboy q in his video dude
hiphopheads,not_removed,im glad you brought it up cause in the other thread no one mentioned it and i was like hmmm am i really the only one who noticed each character looked like a rapperartist i pretty much have the same list as you although for a minute i thought the dude with the white glasses looked kinda like gucci mane
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes talking to mumble rapper to be humble so i do think he is doing a parody here to the right looks like kodak then could be daveed diggs ill be surprised tho i dont think he would put schoolboy
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i think hes parodying them in this shot a lot of the song seems to be him taking shots at rappers out there right now telling them to sit down be humble this looks like some of the rappers hed be taking shots at
hiphopheads,not_removed,i disagree given kendricks track record and the amount of effort clearly put into the production of this video i dont see why theyd take an image as recognizable as the last supper and fill it with randos not meant to represent anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,ill take an l here and will admit i didnt know what mackwopjay rockali looked like it didnt seem like too much of a stretch given the content of the song
hiphopheads,not_removed,those arent characters those are his freinds
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is like the sixth time this has been posted those are all his friends he references quite a few of them in his songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,right it could go either way his friends at the table with him or his friends appearing to look like certain characters in the video shoot
hiphopheads,not_removed,hate when you guys says dont up vote when its clear you want an up vote
hiphopheads,not_removed,following
hiphopheads,not_removed,great postfind
hiphopheads,not_removed,eminem vs lil uzi vert lets put this to bed who ya got
hiphopheads,not_removed,it may seem close now that desiigner is in the spotlight but unless if he can actually put out an amazing album soon its going to be obvious in years that future is leagues ahead of desiigner
hiphopheads,not_removed,personally i like desiigner more than future desiigner has this wild crazy energy that i enjoy
hiphopheads,not_removed,this isnt really a conversation or argument has released loads of material the other copied the first guy once and went to number you cant even really say how good or bad desiigner is as hes only released track
hiphopheads,not_removed,lyrically i feel panda is pretty complex
hiphopheads,not_removed,he just released a mixtape tho aside caliber the mixtape sound more like bobby shmurda and chief keef than future
hiphopheads,not_removed,to be fair without this song nobody would be able to make a hit single that compares pandas to cars
hiphopheads,not_removed,my thoughts on
hiphopheads,not_removed,who are you supposed to be
hiphopheads,not_removed,the potato
hiphopheads,not_removed,opinions on an album i heard through a live stream through an xbox on tv speakers
hiphopheads,not_removed,someone get this man a cd drive
hiphopheads,not_removed,the album has not been leaked its just a periscope stream the guy streaming seems pretty chill but has no cd player its kinda funny he really wants to leak it but has no means to thanks macbook air i stopped watching because i want to hear cdq the first listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont see the point of downloading leaks anymore when they are so close to the release and having apple music makes me lazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,track two is straight george clinton edit track three is also straight george clinton when was the last time a mainstream artist really dabbled in funk
hiphopheads,not_removed,ah shit been waiting to hear this hows the quality
hiphopheads,not_removed,does he have an android phone if yes shouldnt he be able to rip the to the xbox hdd then transfer it to his phone then upload it
hiphopheads,not_removed,morning my love
hiphopheads,not_removed,gone now
hiphopheads,not_removed,xbox rip for life
hiphopheads,not_removed,broadcast is dead now
hiphopheads,not_removed,this isnt just dabbling this is gambino doing his best pfunk impression to varied results
hiphopheads,not_removed,tpab still brazy to some extent
hiphopheads,not_removed,k dot kinda started the wave back up
hiphopheads,not_removed,not a legit leak yet tbh its a periscope of dude playing the album on his xbox no download or anything as of yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not that bad actually expected it to be shit but its listenable edit yes i was talking about actual sound quality not the quality of the music i expect everything bino releases to be dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,xbox one doesnt let you rip music to it only play right off the disc also thered still be no way to transfer from the xbox to his phone
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats pfunk im trying to find music similar to the singles binos released would that be it
hiphopheads,not_removed,still brazy is gfunk
hiphopheads,not_removed,give me an example of common doing pfunk please ill wait
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk why u getting donwnvoted pretty sure he was talking about the fidelity not bino sucking guys
hiphopheads,not_removed,fr thats wild trash you used to be able to do it with the
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikipfunk is the psychedelic funk of parliament and funkadelic both headed by georege clinton if im correct if youve been to a black cookout youve heard this music lol clintons solo work has some hits too while parliament is more straight forward funk funkadelic dabbles more in psychedelia if you like this sound check out some of kendrick lamars stuff from his untitled mixtape snoop dogg yg erykah badu you should check out the song that redbone replays called id rather be with you by bootsy coolinsthe uncle of snoop i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,g funk comes from sampling parliament p in p funk is parliament so
hiphopheads,not_removed,eh it reads off a flashdrive and in this day in age who needs more i havent ever owned a cd besides
hiphopheads,not_removed,whoops thought he was going off the pfunk thread but yeah i guess either way gfunk pfunk is still funk yall right and now i like reading funk funk
hiphopheads,not_removed,real talk ronda doing no press was a fucking huge mistake now that shes lost the general public is clowning on her if she just came out and said she was in a bad mental state after her first loss she wouldnt be getting efukt so hard rn but she did it to herself so gj ronda youve taken a ton of ls tonight
hiphopheads,not_removed,rip ronda
hiphopheads,not_removed,he really jinxed it with this song
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely one of my favorites off of the perfect love tape and man that fight was so tough to watch ronda just got her shit rocked didnt look mentally prepared at all and nunez just whooped her shit hope ronda can come back from this and hope luv is rage drops soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,why was everybody so high on ronda anyway
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,the only song from this mixtape i still listen to
hiphopheads,not_removed,not so much haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,hold on let me think of a good response to this aaaaaaaaaaaaaahahhhahahahahahah
hiphopheads,not_removed,it doesnt really matter whether a fighter does press or not during the diaz vs mac press conferences diaz was practically nonexistent only chiming in with i dont give a fuck or we will see motherfucker he really shouldnt have been there some fights can be hyped up if a fighter is not doing media obligations ronda earned in purse tonight so that is one w under her belt today
hiphopheads,not_removed,i am glad nunes dealt with her before cyborg i think we would have witnessed a death on live tv
hiphopheads,not_removed,she had already lost before this song
hiphopheads,not_removed,because the general public has absolutely no clue what makes a fighter great they just know who wins and thats it it was like when tito ortiz was the champ when the ufc was first purchased by the fertitta brothers he was beating up on tomato cans before chuck liddell and randy couture stepped on the scene at lbs me personally i didnt see much in her due to her weak striking and one dimensional ground attack it was a matter of time before she faced someone with better striking and good enough takedown defense to stop her takedowns holly did it pretty well and nunes never gave her a chance to even attempt a takedown for what shes done all the women at owe her big time she pioneered bantamweight mma for women on the biggest stage the ufc but i do feel the sport has caught up to her which was one thing she had over everyone at one point
hiphopheads,not_removed,she was funny and cool in interviews and was good at making her competitors seem like crazy psychos
hiphopheads,not_removed,she was a girl who won and was not as ugly as the rest of the girls also her whole shtick resonates with all the girls who pretend to be tough
hiphopheads,not_removed,casuals believed the hype
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know most disagree but its my favorite uzi tape tbh erase your social i can drive million of us youre lostfire from front to back
hiphopheads,not_removed,you tried
hiphopheads,not_removed,it do not matter
hiphopheads,not_removed,man that just isnt true diaz has highlight reels of all the hilarious stuff him and conor did and like you said diaz was at a press conference ronda didnt even do one
hiphopheads,not_removed,come back and win like you never lost
hiphopheads,not_removed,because her competition was fucking trash except miesha tate
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with your first paragraphs not the third the tito analogy is fantastic she didnt pioneer anything she was the one the ufc selected to be the face she was giftwrapped a legacy she didnt pave the way or anything dana white deserves the credit if you want to credit anyone he did all the matchmaking and promotion
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly diaz was just being diaz and that played to the camera he showed up for media because he knew conor was big money and he opened up a fucking goldmine for himself when he beat conor the first time and now imagine how much hell rake in for a fight
hiphopheads,not_removed,if ronda didnt exist dana wouldve kept the ufc a mens club only there are multiple times hes said this people wont give her the credit she deserves because of how she fell to rock bottom sort of like how tyson fell to rock bottom
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive been saying that since she showed up to be honest never was impressed
hiphopheads,not_removed,its the truth though miesha was the only one that people really considered great the rest were fighters who had one foot in and one foot out none of those early fights she had were against anyone with legitimate futures in the sport
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats because dana can be dumb as fucking rocks when it comes to booking he didnt snag rousey because she was this undeniable force of nature that was so amazing she blew the doors open she was a pretty face that he could market a lot more easily than someone like cyborg who actually would have earned the accolades i never liked rousey from day one it was obvious dana built her up like tito by promoting her as some unbeatable legend and making sure her competition was weak until she ran into her chuck liddell he used her for ppv money never like a real athlete
hiphopheads,not_removed,well zingano tkod nunes and rousey beat zingano in like seconds
hiphopheads,not_removed,when dana grabbed rousey rousey was the best thing at the only fighter that wouldve given her problems was cyborg who doesnt really fight at ever she was the champ at strikeforce and then became the champ again in the ufc at the time there was simply no better mma fighter at her weight class so to say shes nothing but a pretty face is going wayyy too far and im a person who was never a fan of rousey
hiphopheads,not_removed,and i am shes got a hell of a judo pedigree i dont mean to sound like i think shes some bum off the street its more like i hate her attitude the domestic violence story pissed me off and the fact that she was promoted like the greatest female athlete on the planet felt like a huge spit in the face of women in nonmma sports who were competing up against decades of champions rather than in a brandnew division in a young sport
hiphopheads,not_removed,zingano has also gone on a two fight losing streak while nunes has improved greatly from two years ago when she lost to zingano like i said a lot of the women at or in general have one foot in and one foot out
hiphopheads,not_removed,shes not nothing but a pretty face but her marketable image went leagues in giving her that push that dana did maybe he really couldnt find anyone to give her a challenge but watching her fights and i remember her in strikeforce it was pretty obvious that she was a judo fighter who was gonna get dismantled as soon as anyone with a standup game fought her and thats exactly what happened i dont buy the best thing at argument anyway because its not like dana was somehow contractually obligated to make sure the superstar was in bantamweight just makes me think of tim sylvia champ because there was no one better around at the time
hiphopheads,not_removed,it just seems a little revisionist to discredit zingano like that finished both tate and nunes then lost to ronda and pena we cant just retroactively say that these women have foot out the door hell alexis davis has a black belt in both jj and bjj i think its more likely that ronda is not viewed as an immortal by her opponents anymore rather than these very decorated women actually being cans
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was widely accepted by various mma websites with ranking systems that she was the best thing at from you dont have to buy into anything its just fact you can choose to deny facts if you want but its not wise pretty faces also dont go on to defend their world title times though i will agree she was one dimensional which was going to be her demise in the end
hiphopheads,not_removed,id say zingano was all in two years ago but losing the way she did to rousey can break you mentally at this point losing to pena who many believed would lose to zingano is almost the figurative nail in the coffin particularly at her age of disregarding zingano the rest of rondas career consists of fights against fighters who arent even in the top anymore with most of them not even in the top at her weight class that speaks volumes as it shows the people she fought didnt grow with the sport that in my mind is the very definition of one foot in one foot out a very similar sentiment that even tate has expressed when she retired if you dont grow into a better fighter over time that means you arent dedicated
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably my favorite song on iiidrops
hiphopheads,not_removed,can anyone name the producerbeat in this feel like ive heard this beat somewheremaybe curreny anyway jpurp did his thang on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,purple
hiphopheads,not_removed,this guy has serious potential for a mixtape that was quality stuff
hiphopheads,not_removed,has to be tied with cornerstore for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,cornerstone is my favorite track from iiidrops but morning sex is

hiphopheads,not_removed,of december when it hit the midnight ill be coming like santa bangz going in with absolutely no regard
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you havent heard it youve got to listen to conways album reject its really good and was extremely overlooked
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes im so pumped for new czarface ive been listening to every hero needs a villain a lot lately to get ready for this this album is probably the one ive been most excited for so far this year deck and eso go off each other so well over beats
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit this is hot
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is very dope i see the whole album is on youtube any idea when it officially releases
hiphopheads,not_removed,just finished my first listen and its really good its a really quick album only minutes but thats not necessarily bad as it doesnt over stay its welcome and remains fresh throughout what really impressed me first time around was beats i think its the best produced of the three albums the beats sound fresh and modern while still retaining that comicbooky boom bap style
hiphopheads,not_removed,friday
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not out yet tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,well the full album is on youtube now
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh word i though it was still coming out early next year gonna have to give it a listen in the car tomorrow
hiphopheads,not_removed,i loved yes lawd outstanding piece of work from paak
hiphopheads,not_removed,i had no idea they even had a friendship to begin with i thought thug was always tryna get his attention and it was a awkward semi beef between the two since he came on the scene
hiphopheads,not_removed,this makes me happy
hiphopheads,not_removed,this seems lit af makes me want be there goin buckwild in the crowd
hiphopheads,not_removed,this crowd not nearly hyped enough for thug coming out ik its but this is around the time that video of kanye singing this came out and shit song was big as fuck
hiphopheads,not_removed,same here i follow young thug closely and i had no idea this clip existed makes me sad of what could have been if it wasnt for the beef they had
hiphopheads,not_removed,if that tracklist was correct then yt wouldve been on on the song grindin so yeah seems they were cool back then
hiphopheads,not_removed,god damnit could you imagine a youngxwayne full mixtape like blow waynejuelz but better haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,the featuring drake grindin or a different song
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah thats right thats right
hiphopheads,not_removed,remix of grindin it supposedly featured thug and young jeezy edit also rich homie quan claimed to be an unlisted feature on it as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,wingstop fat boy need a ten piece
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song is perfect hip hop for me the way kendrick kills the games first verse but then the game comes back and absolutely murders the third verse the fucking badu sample the fucking switch to kendricks vocals becoming the backing for the games verse its insane all of it
hiphopheads,not_removed,god that fucking erykah badu sample is too perfect every time
hiphopheads,not_removed,gunshot always gets me at the beginning

hiphopheads,not_removed,daaamn daniel
hiphopheads,not_removed,that tamy lahren bit lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love that jayz appreciates italian cinema for the record fellini is one of the baddest directors of all time
hiphopheads,not_removed,king push when
hiphopheads,not_removed,before reasonable doubt dropped the jury hung this might just be my favorite jay z line ever that triple fucking entendre
hiphopheads,not_removed,jays flow on this song is so good its simple but the way he says my tenure took me through virginia gets me every time
hiphopheads,not_removed,my brick talk is more than obvious its ominous
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,need more dahi x hov in my life
hiphopheads,not_removed,was this just a random single or is it supposed to be part of pusha ts next album
hiphopheads,not_removed,gooogles your friend bruhhh
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is such a great song on my rotation currently
hiphopheads,not_removed,smh i missed this track its gorgeous
hiphopheads,not_removed,king push is anonymous for kingpin
hiphopheads,not_removed,not a fan of either artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude this is really one of my favorite beats what are some other notable songs by dahi i should listen to so i could hear more like this
hiphopheads,not_removed,lupe fiasco chopper
hiphopheads,not_removed,dahi got a album coming soon as well will be a blessing
hiphopheads,not_removed,dude i am so hype im so ready for a masterpiece
hiphopheads,not_removed,keep grinding
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,i second this
hiphopheads,not_removed,jay z the meme rapper
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly i thought it was a pretty dope line
hiphopheads,not_removed,fbi keep bringin them all white vans through
hiphopheads,not_removed,dam that was tamy all along fuck it this song is soty
hiphopheads,not_removed,hung jury jewellery hung is a double am i missing one
hiphopheads,not_removed,hov really has a thing for dropping amazing triple entendres brooklyn go hard i jack i rob i sin aww man im jackie robinson cept when i run base i dodge the pen pressure too much green you cant talk in my hue
hiphopheads,not_removed,can you explain
hiphopheads,not_removed,jay is too good he got push on this one imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,no one knows but its provocative
hiphopheads,not_removed,i believe all of the singles that have black and white album cover and side tape drug dealers anonymous circles hgtv freestyle are singles for his next album
hiphopheads,not_removed,mind if i ask why
hiphopheads,not_removed,money trees is a must i also really like the outro from dark sky paradise from rodeo and u with me off views theyre all pretty dope imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,casey veggies she in my car is probably my favorite beat by him
hiphopheads,not_removed,also cinderella by mac miller
hiphopheads,not_removed,worst behavior drake my type of party by dom kennedy travis scott and i think he did the sample part on big sean idfwu he also produced a couple songs on wales last album i think helium balloon god smile and another song
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly tree of life by absoul is a great one he didnt produce the main song but he dropped a simply but fire beat for the pt at the end
hiphopheads,not_removed,his work on tetsuo and youth
hiphopheads,not_removed,madonna adoration and tron are all even better
hiphopheads,not_removed,rise and grind lets get this money can i get a yee yee
hiphopheads,not_removed,the ambidextrous line is so hard it deserves a damn after it anyway
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea especially with it coupled with the next line it works with the whole theme of the track
hiphopheads,not_removed,mods keep bringin them allmighty bans through if yall dont stop with these lyric chains
hiphopheads,not_removed,mods
hiphopheads,not_removed,yup her to this track lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol was it actually hahahahahaha this makes the track
hiphopheads,not_removed,def tabetha prob got mad af lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,a hung jury or deadlocked jury is a judicial jury that cannot agree upon a verdict after extended deliberation and is unable to reach the required unanimity or supermajority basically meaning one is a play on court lingo because the court couldnt convict someone without reasonable doubt is jewellery hung meaning he was on an album cover with a chain his homie let him wear before he ever dropped reasonable doubt is that before he dropped reasonable doubt the jury the hip hop fans and critics were unsure about jay z
hiphopheads,not_removed,before rd the album came out people werent sure about hov as a rapper before rd in the context of a trial was presented in a case the jury was hung meaning it was on guiltynot guilty before rd the album dropped the jewelry hung meaning he had money even without rapping

hiphopheads,not_removed,youre not suppose to ask how
hiphopheads,not_removed,i prefer west coast rap and trap music
hiphopheads,not_removed,whaaat dude those are all some of my favorites especially this dude is talented
hiphopheads,not_removed,the outro from dsp is so amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn cant believe ive never heard of him those are all great tracks does he have any beat tapes
hiphopheads,not_removed,wasnt more heavy with mike dean
hiphopheads,not_removed,chopper by lupe fiasco
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,calm down carlton
hiphopheads,not_removed,ahh gotcha i think i always thought of and as and kinda but i see it now good explanation
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks i didnt get the last one before because i didnt put the jewelleryjury thing together
hiphopheads,not_removed,dahi is one of the best producers in hip hop rn hes criminally underrated though he deserves to be up there with metro in terms of producer superstardom
hiphopheads,not_removed,look up thc they also have a hand in these songs and a lot of dahis work youll like them too
hiphopheads,not_removed,he worked on dark sky too damn this my favorite producer now 😳 btw everyone should go re listen to dsp that album was slept on hard except the obvious hits
hiphopheads,not_removed,he has instrumental album toys weird but cool stuff also check out his wikipedia page for all production credits
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats this from
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant we do without both
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean its a hiphop forum where else are we gonna have some lyric chains
hiphopheads,not_removed,i could see that
hiphopheads,not_removed,go fuck urself bud ignorant ass
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think hes underrated lol if he had a beat tag everyone would know who he is you can tell which beats he produces just listen to the drums 🤓
hiphopheads,not_removed,well this is my issue how was i supposed to know who dahi even was search who produced xxx everytime i hear a good beat more producers need recognizable tags
hiphopheads,not_removed,its slept on for a reason its a decent album for sure but hip hop had so many better releases
hiphopheads,not_removed,i got the keys
hiphopheads,not_removed,probably on the other of subs lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,was just really worried i had missed an obvious third meaning after having listened to this track a few hundred times lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,man thats honestly probably costing him mad money like if metro didnt have a tag he wouldnt be so big but because he does he can probably make guap off solo shows and appearances
hiphopheads,not_removed,isnt underrated lmao he gets kits directly gifted to him from kanye himself
hiphopheads,not_removed,maybe this is selfish of me but i cant stand producer tags its pretty much the worst part of the song every time
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont know man i was just saying dahi is really good cause i love dahi
hiphopheads,not_removed,bless
hiphopheads,not_removed,less is more my guy 💯
hiphopheads,not_removed,dahi probably just likes the be more lowkey peoples personality are a big factor
hiphopheads,not_removed,fsmh tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,just like all aspects of music if theyre used correctly theyre dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree music is an art form i have a major respect for hip hop producers but it can majorly ruin a song to the point where i dont want to listen to it hearing producer tags all over it
hiphopheads,not_removed,blesss ftfy
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think you are both a bit right is very underrated in the general public just cause he doesnt really work with anyone outside of ovo but also hes very known and respected inside the music world to the point someone like kanye is a peer and both are considered tops in the industry in production
hiphopheads,not_removed,more people know who is then metro thats a fact idk the fuck youre on about
hiphopheads,not_removed,you are very wrong on this metros tag becoming a meme cemented his popularity
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree about the whole general public stuff but you were talking about that guy who was discrediting just cuz he said kanye sends him drumkits i think you took it the wrong way i dont think he was saying oh kanye is so great that he just gifts lesser people stuff i think it was more regarding how big is in the industry that kanyesomeone that he has said in the past has influenced his work and many people strive to work with will give drumkits to him this is not whole songs or instrumentals but like small elements of tracks that could make songs better when uses them right many people have theyre own drumkits and pride themselves on how unique theyre drums are so kanye being in a relationship where hes sending drumkits to shows that hes has enough respect for him as producer to just send him drumkits rather than whole beats
hiphopheads,not_removed,to repetitive for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,the goat
hiphopheads,not_removed,my favorite song on the mixtape along with sias satisfied
hiphopheads,not_removed,the one on his left cheekbone is yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,issa knife
hiphopheads,not_removed,the only confusion is that the members only logos crack in the heart is more rounded off and even disconnects towards the middle but his face tat seems different
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpsinstagramcompblgbrwgdvjk
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol seriously though
hiphopheads,not_removed,like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,you can edit your comments by pressing the edit button next to save its just a shitty tat its obviously meant to be members only
hiphopheads,not_removed,leaning lean lean lean lean leanleanlean i have made this same comment every time this song is posted
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song started a fucking legacy i love you young thug no joke im glad im living in a time where i get to see him thrive and develop
hiphopheads,not_removed,this the song that got me to really keep checking out young thug thug was a great project that i never hear too much about anymore
hiphopheads,not_removed,first thugga song i ever heard
hiphopheads,not_removed,are you smoking penises
hiphopheads,not_removed,no lie its still my favorite young thug project i got love for everything else but thug was where it all started for me and there are just anthems that ive carried with me stood the test of time i guess always have fun with each listen if youre reading this and are new to thug loved all his recent work i implore you to listen to thug
hiphopheads,not_removed,smoking a fat ass penis rn bro
hiphopheads,not_removed,i got barter and rich gang tha tour as my top now its gonna be my though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wish i could get paid to smoke fat penises
hiphopheads,not_removed,im convinced roy is the most talented man in ovo aside from drake himself he sounds like the king of pop himself sometimes and just reeks of potential i think he might be able to fill the void left by the weeknd in drakes camp to be completely honest im not calling roy a weeknd clone or anythingi just think the talent level is similar roy is only years oldwhich i think is the same age the weeknd dropped house of balloons while this tape isnt at that levelit shows an immense amount of talent that i feel will make roy huge
hiphopheads,not_removed,one of my favorites of definitely recommend if you want to get into his music
hiphopheads,not_removed,personally i think this is a great project and one of ovos best albums released so far roy grows from where he was a year ago with exis coming in with some catchy hooks great moody lyrics and sounds and some amazing production still cant find the personnel credits yet gwan big up urself and how i feel are solid tracks but i unfortunately played them out quite a bit before this dropped in anticipation of some new roy woods why premiered a couple weeks ago on ovo sound radio and ive also been playing it on loop as well but glad to have a cdq version other than previously heard songs some stand out tracks include first sonic boom a strong transition from his previous ep into waking at dawn sets the mood quickly with his moody and hollow sounding singing you love it is another stand out track with some of his signature quick rapping and some more quick singing during the choruses the last one that has really caught my attention and im guilty of overplaying it already is down girl this song encompasses everything thats great about roy woods music and is extremely catchy i think this shouldve been a lead single and probably should be pushed byovo to get some radio play as much as i like the subject matter and how he showed his singing ability i wish i got some hard stuff such as unleashed from exis or his guest verse on by tripsixx thankfully he seems to just be getting started in his music career still just years old and has plenty of time to experiment with different sounds i was looking forward to this project with high anticipation and excitement and i have to say it exceeded my expectations and then some this year and past month especially has been busy with so many new music releases fortunately i believe waking at dawn wont be overshadowed and i hope roy woods gets a ton of exposure from it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i loved this project was surprised there were no features especially no drake feature which can be a good thing but i think it was a good move by roy and ovo roys got so much potential i cant wait to see his future
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a very good project very smooth with heavy nighttime driving vibes easily has the best voice out of all the ovo recruits and has that star potential that the weeknd had with the trilogy even if roy hasnt put out anything thats as good as trilogy yet definitely one of ovos best projects and im looking forward to what he puts out in the future standouts you love it how i feel
hiphopheads,not_removed,on his first fulllength release bramptonborn ovosigned rb singer roy wood brings exactly whats expected of him waking at dawn is perfectly titled and exactly the right time to listen to his music following in the paths carved by labelhead drake and fellow canadian the weeknd roy crafts a nice project that any fan of rb should check out sonic boom on the intro roy sings a single verse and lets the hook do most of the talking the sparse beat captures the themes of the lyrics perfectly you love it a more conventional rb sounding type beat on this track roy raps instead of sings and i feel like his flow is very reminiscent of a softer less shouty version of denzel currys i liked the shoutout to drama on this track gwan big up urself the albums second single brings a bit of a tropical feel roy sings mostly in jamaican patois and theres a nice chill beat in the background roys accent is already very toronto so this track makes a lot of sense how i feel one of the best tracks and the first single the delivery on this track is awesome i love it so much the beat has a bit more of a dancey feel making me think majid jordan influenced this song at least a bit down girl another one of the best tracks one of the catchiest hooks and prehooks this one is a fucking jam good girl with the bad fat ass got me feeling like a nerd with an asthma attack is straight up savagery this could be a radio single if ovo pushed it i only wished it was a bit longer switch roy raises his voice on this joint the prehook is so dope roy lets his feelings out which is funny considering jealousy from his last ep got me this is the song that reminds me most of exis but even then i dont feel like it wouldve fit there this song is dope even if its one of my least favourites why this murdaproduced song premiered on the last episode of ovo sound radio and i think its a good song menace super chill song this one feels like you could just relax to it while driving this one has hit potential as well she knows about me cool outro track again he references a song from his last project in this case go go go the production on this is so smooth great way to wrap up the album in conclusion i think this is one of the best albums ovo has put out yet perfect length tons of replay ability ive listened times in between canada day celebrations with my family and some of the best cover art ive seen its not a perfect project though all of the songs feel a bit short with most coming in around minutes long i also wish that roy had a couple of features on here a track with ramriddlz or uzi couldve served this project well roy woods has a promising future and ill keep listening to what he puts out fav tracks how i feel switch down girl least favs got me roy woods waking at dawn ovo sound warner bros utu pbrb trapb pop
hiphopheads,not_removed,we already got summer poppin pnd droppin roy droppin majid jordan droppin ob droppin not to mention me droppin
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes got a lot of potential but his writing is not all the way there also i was hoping for more upbeat tracks
hiphopheads,not_removed,roy did not let down at all exis was my favorite non album project from last year and i was very curious to see the direction he would go this tape is exactly what i was hoping for and the mix of hard hitting vocals and beats with smoothness is so damn good i cannot wait to see where this kid goes he had so so much potential
hiphopheads,not_removed,gwan big up yourself roy woods for this great ass album prob one my favorites if not favorite album so much i just get chills when he start sounding like mj really hope blows the fuck up cause he definitely has the potential
hiphopheads,not_removed,unreal his voice is so damn powerful continuing to be my favorite rb artist out currently down girl might be my favorite roy song
hiphopheads,not_removed,really really good roy is super talented production is excellent front to back roy sounds brilliant in terms of voice and flows best songs for me are sonic boom switch and got me gwan big up urself and how i feel are also both still terrific and were excellent in their role as singles and representing the general sound of the album this project showcases a lot of woods talented and why people should be getting pretty excited about him ive been following his career super closely since it began and will definitely be continuing to do so my only wish is ovo would push their artists a bit more drake hasnt even tweeted or instagramd anything about the album yet it doesnt look like its going to get the exposure it deserves i see the comments sticking up for ovo and talking about its one of his first releases and stuff but that doesnt excuse the fact that its probably going to move like first week when it could easily be pushing starting to feel like ovo dont know what it takes to be a successful record label for all the shit people on here give tde about delaying projects and stuff they do a much better job generating hype and exposure for their artists hopefully drake and co learn with time anyway check out this project if you havent listened yet one of the best of the year for me so far
hiphopheads,not_removed,see dvsn
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i think depending on how sounds roy could be the next big thing off that label and start to overshadow pnd
hiphopheads,not_removed,im convinced roy is the most talented man in ovo aside from drake himself he sounds like the king of pop himself sometimes and just reeks of potential i agree what i think makes roy so different from others in ovo is his aggression when he starts half shouting the pre hook on switch it hits you right in the gut like you can feel his fustration on the track he also sounds much more at home on the dancehall type stuff than drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,does he self produce his stuff
hiphopheads,not_removed,if were talking voicesound id agree but imo party is more talented in light of his production flows writing for drake rihanna bieber etc all that roy definitely has the best sound though
hiphopheads,not_removed,roy woods is like billion times more talented than bryon tiller imo but ya i agree
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre tossing the word underrated very loosely here how can you underrate someone that has only one full length major project out dont get me wrong im enjoying this project and exis has been on repeat for a while but roy still has time and room for growth of his talent and fanbase
hiphopheads,not_removed,poor ob will never drop
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake is more concerned with having his squad play supporting roles than their success no one can be allowed to come close to eclipsing drake by any means and i firmly believe an artist like roy has that kind of star power
hiphopheads,not_removed,really underrated
hiphopheads,not_removed,dvsn is a duo and arent very interesting the ep they dropped earlier this year was actually pretty good but they dont stand out enough amongst all the other rb acts these daysincluding their peers majid jordan
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree what i think makes roy so different from others in ovo is his aggression when he starts half shouting the pre hook on switch it hits you right in the gut like you can feel his fustration on the track same with get you good w the i know that im young but im just being honest part
hiphopheads,not_removed,nahh
hiphopheads,not_removed,how are they not very interesting when their album was pretty good to me they are a breath of fresh air their sound is heavily influenced by late early rb both their vocals and production stand out from many rb artists
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah the vocals and production are good but theres not a lot of personality there
hiphopheads,not_removed,fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,book of soul by absoul absolute heart wrencher
hiphopheads,not_removed,agreed
hiphopheads,not_removed,musikal has the dopest production
hiphopheads,not_removed,dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,percent man
hiphopheads,not_removed,beating drake must be so crazy for him
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats actually pretty dope hope it makes him more confident in his upcoming releases and he tries something new
hiphopheads,not_removed,a great day for canada and therefore the world
hiphopheads,not_removed,cuzzi bitch i loved his song roses boinks so hard in the whip apparently boinks even harder in canada
hiphopheads,not_removed,neat anybody know who he was up against
hiphopheads,not_removed,so incredibly happy for him deserved
hiphopheads,not_removed,not a dig on jazz cartier but it always seems like canadian awards shows give the award to whoever decides to show up at the event
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love the song one day
hiphopheads,not_removed,the legend grows
hiphopheads,not_removed,well deserved congrats mate
hiphopheads,not_removed,this actually seems like an award show with interesting winners and nominees
hiphopheads,not_removed,fwiw i thoroughly enjoyed hotel paranoia much more than i did views he definitely deserved it more than drake did
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you didnt give me the ol parenthesis with canadas grammys i would have had no idea what this ish was
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is like winning an olympic gold for the dash
hiphopheads,not_removed,they rarely give it to drake iirc junos are not a popularity contest like the grammys
hiphopheads,not_removed,his next release is pretty much finished at this point or at least it should be considering it was meant to be out two months ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,want him to return to his first sound and not the sound on hotel paranoia
hiphopheads,not_removed,red alert too
hiphopheads,not_removed,there are a lot of boinkers on that album tbh i assumed people on here would have received it well but it seems like its generally disliked
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt expect to beat drake but yall been snubbing him all night jazz
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty sure he was against drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats why i did it fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah its more like winning a juno award for best rap album cuz thats what it is thats a huge milestone for a canadian rapper to achieve dont be a fuckin asshole about someone elses success
hiphopheads,not_removed,no way that would be really cool its more like fattest person
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake is still by far the most accomplished canadian rapper lmao who the fuck is downvoting this the dude has a billboard record over the fucking beatles foh
hiphopheads,not_removed,according to what
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like on his first album he had a really clean sound that defined him as an artist a few of the tracks were heavily houstontrap inspired but he made them his own not to mention many of the tracks were very pop rnb influenced but he did a really good job bridging the gap between them and hiphop hotel paranoia started off really strong but slowly became really grimey and beyond repetitive the beats were consistent but the whole middle of the album almost felt like the same track regardless i did enjoy a few tracks here and there hopefully his next album explores some new territory and tops what he had to offer last year
hiphopheads,not_removed,well shit i hope kaytranada took the breakthrough category even though hes been shining a few years now
hiphopheads,not_removed,ayyyy andy shauf in a category with tory lanez thats definitely one i didnt expect
hiphopheads,not_removed,and the rightful album won for once nice
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,of course theres not debate hes also my favourite what does that have to do with my comment tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,you mean sells the most
hiphopheads,not_removed,him
hiphopheads,not_removed,shut up its not the same sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was a good break down some of the middle tracks are pretty repetitive and boring i had never listened to his earlier stuff so hotel paranoia was my first time hearing him and i liked most of it i think he did a pretty good job mixing rapping with poppycatchy hooks and his singing is pretty decent either way im hopeful for his next album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think hes broken through now though cementing himself equally as a hiphop producer alongside his dance credentials but yeah i kinda agree ive been a fan of kaytra for years on soundcloud since he revolutionized that scene
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think he won best electronic album for
hiphopheads,not_removed,eh both album were pretty disappointing jazz didnt have the best canadian rap album last year
hiphopheads,not_removed,man you really hate drake idk whats worse your warriors stanning or your drake hate
hiphopheads,not_removed,jazz is really awful man hasnt even got his own sound biggest biter in hip hop rn
hiphopheads,not_removed,im saying drake has the benefit of historically making good music as well as being immensely popular just because drake wins a grammyjuno doesnt necessarily mean someone else was more deserving
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah thats what accomplished means
hiphopheads,not_removed,uh no i mean he has by far the most impressive discography in what universe is this even debatable
hiphopheads,not_removed,you seem to be quite updated about his album releases good thing too liked his black and misguided track on the hotel paranoia
hiphopheads,not_removed,when did he say it was supposed to be out months ago
hiphopheads,not_removed,also good
hiphopheads,not_removed,who do you think should of won i really liked tory lanez album but i dont know many other canadian albums off the top of my head
hiphopheads,not_removed,do you follow this nigga across subreddits
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would take jazz over drake any day too
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree but a lot of the time there is better rap music coming out of canada that they give it to whereas the grammys generally only nominate and award the most popular albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,how can an opinion not be debated lmao nothing but closed minded individuals
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes been saying stuff on snapchat for awhile about it being nearly done or stuff im not really certain how specific he got but i know snapchat is the source here
hiphopheads,not_removed,all the big canadian releases i can think of in were disappointing jazz drake the weeknd pnd tory all didnt come through heres projects that werent disappointing to me from canadians allan kingdom northern lights shad adult contempt
hiphopheads,not_removed,hold up torys was straight trash the album was a big let down from all his singles
hiphopheads,not_removed,um i see him here and rnba all the time i dont try to look for this comments
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive seen him on like every drake thread in the last month or so with that meek mill flair and his sour attitude
hiphopheads,not_removed,whoop sick burn
hiphopheads,not_removed,make an argument then i could use a good laugh today
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought allan kingdom was from minnesota
hiphopheads,not_removed,whatd you think of night lovells album last year
hiphopheads,not_removed,jazz is not a big release lol lets not get too hipstery here
hiphopheads,not_removed,have never heard of the other two can you give me some comparisons i might sus them out when i have time
hiphopheads,not_removed,hell to the no was straight fire and i told you was amazing too
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean i think classified or maestro fresh are head and shoulders above him in terms of pure skills as rappers
hiphopheads,not_removed,because yours is such a good argument lmao i also needed a laugh thanks for that
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes from winnipeg i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,he was born and partially raised in winnipeg
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think it has some really good songs but overall its not amazing
hiphopheads,not_removed,homie just won a juno we dont have to pretend he a nobody
hiphopheads,not_removed,was a good amount worse than the first one imo and i told you was way too long and i only enjoyed about songs off of it tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait was an album i thought it was a mixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay but were talking about making great rap albums not being good at rapping
hiphopheads,not_removed,can you give me a list of songs or albums to listen to by these guys i have never heard of them
hiphopheads,not_removed,i had literally not heard of a juno until i saw it on his live instagram feed
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like the first one better but the second one was still amazing dopeman go lick x drive you crazy new yearauce super freaky anyway i told you had some decent songs and some fire songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea my bad it was
hiphopheads,not_removed,they kinda go hand in handgo listen to some classified and tell me he isnt a better rapper and makes better album you cant tell me stuff like a song overcrowded more life playlistmixtape is a great rap album
hiphopheads,not_removed,hard to be hip hop class ft maestro that aint classy classified fall from paradise classified unexplainable hunger classified ft royce find out classified unsual ft joe budden listen to beatin it that one is especially dope watch the live performance his most recent commercial success is no pressure ft snoop dogg and filthy with a dj premiere beat both from his most recent album gratefull i could list his whole discography honestly but my personal favourite are self explanatory grateful handshake and middle fingers hitch hikking music and boycotin the industry he produces all his beats or almost all of them to
hiphopheads,not_removed,are you a canadian bc theyre literally the canadian grammys like just bc youre domestic and dont know what the mercury prize is doesnt mean it wasnt a big deal when skepta won last year
hiphopheads,not_removed,so yes torys album ity was straight trash and a huge let down from anything hes ever done
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol more life is drakes worst album idk why youre starting there
hiphopheads,not_removed,name any drake album i can come up with a classified album that is just as good
hiphopheads,not_removed,hell yeah man tipper is dope surprised but happy to see this here
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is the best quality available until the proper release apologies
hiphopheads,not_removed,fire ive been a huge fan of olukara and sophie meier for a while dope song
hiphopheads,not_removed,put a lot of sweat tears into this one wit some very talented people i hope yall enjoy it hny
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt catch this live but the twitch chat was god awful during rtj crowd was super dead here too i dont think gamers and hip hop mesh well
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk i wanna support it but damn after mins i was like wtf am i watching this is pretty bad i dont even mind the song no matter how many times its played
hiphopheads,not_removed,was that tony hawk who introduced them
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao it was micheal phelps
hiphopheads,not_removed,how can it be wrong its their opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont particularly agree with the list but like utomstaysbased said its their opinion i love jay z in my top but i can see how someone else would dislike him and not even add them on their list i wouldnt even consider putting logic in my list but i can understand your friend putting him on their list and even putting him above jay z
hiphopheads,not_removed,logic is in the top but young thug and vince staples didnt chart
hiphopheads,not_removed,cuz young thug isnt h isnt capital in schoolboy q
hiphopheads,not_removed,the list was based solely on who they like listening to the most this list has been a huge topic of argument today so i want to leave it to yall to explain what needs to be done feel free to leave your own too
hiphopheads,not_removed,im sure they could pull something good together different isnt always a bad thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh hell fucking no
hiphopheads,not_removed,terrible
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty awful as they have completely different styles and mac miller is actually good and makes original sounding music
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought their roles on camera were great and they meshed well i could picture mac on white iverson and i could picture stoney on we
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol ignore the troll guys
hiphopheads,not_removed,jfc its not like their styles would mesh together in any way im not a troll because i hate an artist you like
hiphopheads,not_removed,it is if you purposefully mention how trash you think he is every time hes mentioned
hiphopheads,not_removed,people in this thread agree with me so
hiphopheads,not_removed,no they just say they dont know if theyd enjoy a collab album
hiphopheads,not_removed,which was also my answer when the other comments include oh hell fucking no and terrible they agree with me
hiphopheads,not_removed,your answer also included bashing post with the and mac makes original sounding music lets not even get into your post history when it comes to post
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok but you didnt have to include the post malone diss like you always do either
hiphopheads,not_removed,wonder if this means both parts will be included would probably be weird to hear panda in a different song on the radio for people who havent listened to pt before
hiphopheads,not_removed,father stretch my hands
hiphopheads,not_removed,controlla too nice
hiphopheads,not_removed,father stretch my asshole
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant wait for my theater friends to ask me if i know who this nas guy is lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,bustas verse on my shot was amazing imo bustas features on atcq and this make me want to go listen to his stuff but ive never really checked him out before edit also how have i not heard of snow tha product before this she killed immigrants
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely didnt go into this year expecting one of my favorite mixtapes to feature kelly clarkson ben folds jimmy fallon ja rule and ashanti
hiphopheads,not_removed,nas black thought common and ortiz came through but i cant get enough of this regina spektor track
hiphopheads,not_removed,wellwhat a day for hip hop guys
hiphopheads,not_removed,goddammit chance why you keep coming in when im chopping onions ಥ‸ಥ
hiphopheads,not_removed,chance on the dear theodosia reprise is so damn lovely
hiphopheads,not_removed,washingtons by your side is amazing wiz destroys it and it is a fantastic twist on the original the new cabinet battle is definitely cut from the musical and it is excellent too but im biased as i crave more linmanuel overall a great mixtape with several reimaginations of the original songs worth a few listens even if you havent listened to the musical
hiphopheads,not_removed,this mixtape is like things at once your best chance at liking it all is knowing hamiltons music first that being said here are my thoughts most of these features absolutely made the songs their own and killed themnas busta watsky sia spektor llmind ashanti dessa wiz legend common chance some of them were just alright nothing really special alica keys jill scott jperiod and some fell flat or were annoying jimmy fallon and jesus christ this wasnt funny or good all in all there is some serious quality from about of the artists on the album and if you like hamilton this is a definite listen if you dont like hamilton and id first say give it a chance before you hate it listen to the rootsbusta version of my shot nas wrote my way out wizs washingtons by your side and the rootscommons who tells your story
hiphopheads,not_removed,holy shit wiz banger out of nowhere
hiphopheads,not_removed,as someone whos primarily a hiphop fan but also likes hamilton a lot too i thought id throw my opinion in i really couldnt care less for most of the cover songs they have some good moments and its nice to hear what other artists bring to the table with the original songs but for most of them i find myself thinking why arent i just listening to the original from the obc recording and i honestly dont think someone who dislikes hamilton songs is going to suddenly change their opinion just because its sia or john legend singing it now where the mixtape really shines is with the remixes i feel like most hiphop fans have to concede that at least some of the beats from the original musical are good or at least interesting so hearing other rappers going in with their own verses over those beats is awesome it definitely hits the spot for any hamilton fan whos in the mood for listening to hamilton songs without having plot and historical facts thrown in their face the entire time apparently theres going to be a hamilton mixtape volume in the distant future i hope that if that still ends up happening lin goes more along the lines of my shot with the roots and busta and less along the lines of a modernized kelly clarkson version of its quiet uptown
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruhhh i thought this was a charles hamilton mixtape i was so confused lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,chance nas busta wiz were spoiled
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope this album doesnt get overlooked because of all the new music my shot is fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,i havent seen anyone saying anything about dessa killing congratulations shes signed to the label doomtree and is an amazing vocalist and im really happy to see her here with so many heavy hitters i hope if you dont know her this song makes you check out all of her stuff super powerful and im proud to see her here amongst some of the greats
hiphopheads,not_removed,i completely understand how all these features are getting people excited and understandably so but you guys are sleeping on my man residente calle on immigrants heavy the man has got so much skill and his political chops are as strong as ever i understand if one doesnt understand spanish im blessed being a native speaker but you should really check out the lyrics on genius residente speaks from the heart and kills it as always httpgeniuscomknaansnowthaproductrizmcandresidenteimmigrantswegetthejobdonelyrics
hiphopheads,not_removed,wiz really cant control himself with the weed references
hiphopheads,not_removed,this was actually really really good
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok dis hard
hiphopheads,not_removed,bro fuck yes linmanuel is the goat
hiphopheads,not_removed,someone hit me up when it on spotify
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like this is going to get a lot of people into hip hop or more into hip hop i might be biased because i hang with a bunch of white college students being a white college student myself who are really into theater generallyhamilton often most of whom also listen to a little bit of hip hop stoked to hopefully see more of those people exploring the artists featured on this
hiphopheads,not_removed,anyone been to the play they just announced a san francisco run and i believe la would it be better to go on blindly
hiphopheads,not_removed,black thoughts verse on my shot is adapted from his ilab freestyle
hiphopheads,not_removed,nonstop eating
hiphopheads,not_removed,with res you can listen to the full playlist from
hiphopheads,not_removed,youll be back is fantastic jimmy sounds like bowie lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,lets bring turdcuttergroovin into the century
hiphopheads,not_removed,its good but really only because the source material is incredible i dont see any reason to listen to this over the original cast recording though i do love chances song
hiphopheads,not_removed,checking instagram earlier questlove said that this mixtape was the original idea and it was only later did lin manuel think about making the play this may not be news to all but to me it is and i think that is incredible
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not sure why hamilton is so popular or what the hell the point of this is but it has some awesome features so ive give this a listen
hiphopheads,not_removed,so is this mixtape a bunch of artists covering hamilton songs or is it more like a bunch of artists interpreting the song differently just wondering as i know nothing about the musical hamilton
hiphopheads,not_removed,jill scott kills it on say yes to this
hiphopheads,not_removed,i enjoyed it all especially ashanti but damn i was not expecting regina chance to make me cry
hiphopheads,not_removed,nas was a perfect fit for wrote my way out the remixes on this are super good
hiphopheads,not_removed,my mom is so psyched
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive held off on the soundtrack because i want to go see the play when i get a chance did the same with book of mormon does this mixtape contain anything that pertains to the play or any songs in the play thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,someone get immortal technique to do his thing again
hiphopheads,not_removed,havent heard of this before just started all i gotta say is thanks fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,the streets arent ready for this
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw hamilton about two months ago and the soundtrack is the only music ive been listening to since then here are some of my thoughts history has its eye on you john legend in his own right did a great song but i hate when the melody of a cover song is changed it isnt really a coverits an entirely different song its a really good song but different quiet uptown overproduced poppy hogwash seriously the beauty of the original was its simplicity the song wouldve been better a cappella dear theodosia sung really well i thought it was excellent but its a duet i was waiting for ben folds to sing alexanders part and it never came so what started out as a great song led to disappointment helpless awesome it was appropriately adapted from the original with enough originality that it seemed like a fresh updated song wait for it probably the best song on the originalseeing it live oh my godi was blown away usher sang it well but did not explode like it was on stage overall id stay im really disappointed
hiphopheads,not_removed,why aint daveed diggs on this
hiphopheads,not_removed,everybody is ignoring the return of knaan
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn thought it was a new charles hamilton mixtape for a sec
hiphopheads,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment i dont listen to much of snow tha product but i remember this song featuring cyhi was in my rotation for a while a couple years back the songs he used to do on snl weekend update in the style of insert artist here were always solid he can musically imitate almost anyone i also recommend his song idiot boyfriend the video has a young zooey deschanel if you like snow also check out her socal counterpart gavlyn im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch ill keep this updated as long as i can httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get me on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
hiphopheads,not_removed,as much as i cant stand the hamilton phenomenon i must say its pretty clever to make a song about immigrants and have it feature snow tha product
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk why i cant stop laughing at the title
hiphopheads,not_removed,theater dude and hhh here we do exist in large numbers
hiphopheads,not_removed,god damn i relate to this comment so much
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey at least theyll get interested right
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wonder how many theater kids have checked out clipping because of daveed diggs and then moved on to death grips and gotten noided
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw him at lollapalooza a few years ago and the next week my friend texted me and was like holy shit nas just put out a great album its on spotify turns out it was illmatics anniversary reissue
hiphopheads,not_removed,i cant wait to have friends
hiphopheads,not_removed,my girlfriend is the theater friend for me and would actually ask that haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,that last sentence in your edit sounds so wrong lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know that verse had way more fire than i would have expected and made me curious what hes up to on his own these days no album for years and the last one got bad reviews ho hum
hiphopheads,not_removed,my personal favorite busta albums are the coming and ele extinction level event
hiphopheads,not_removed,check out his mixtape return of the dragon the abstract went on vacation
hiphopheads,not_removed,busta and nas on the track dont get carried away lmk what you think
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you like snow also check out her socal counterpart httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhrrvvtvjle
hiphopheads,not_removed,seriously when i saw ashanti feat ja rule i expected my balls to shrink back up my voice to go octaves higher and pimples to start growing back on my face
hiphopheads,not_removed,and watsky
hiphopheads,not_removed,regina spektor is dope though she is definitely my favourite pop artist
hiphopheads,not_removed,are they all in one song
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep hamilton mixtape awaken my love and new cole im not going to get any work done today
hiphopheads,not_removed,his singing voice is so fucking pleasant
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think washingtons on your side was for the hip hoprap crowd who got into hamilton it felt more like those genres than the other songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,linmanuel is all over the moana soundtrack not especially what this sub is about but its very him
hiphopheads,not_removed,cabinet battle is definitely built on tupacs hail mary
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought the fallon version was good it plays up to the hokey out of touch white guy role
hiphopheads,not_removed,i disagree the jill scott one was so smooth the point of view of the song was inverted and it had that old school rb feel
hiphopheads,not_removed,as far as covers that were not good at all i straight up despise ushers version of wait for it
hiphopheads,not_removed,what is hamilton
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly its the only track i was worried about not a fan of whiz material but its so far the only song ive replayed three times in the first listen dope track
hiphopheads,not_removed,andra days burn is crazy good
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel what you are saying but i really like the kelly clarkson version of the song the biggest disappointment for me was ushers wait for it i think it is because it is my favorite song from the musical and he cant match the energy of the original anyways i am glad that this mixtape exists i dont think it will replace the original soundtrack for me but there are some real great songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,potentially unpopular opinion i dont think sia is a good fit for satisfied ive listened to it a bunch of times and still have no idea what emotion if any shes trying to conway
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive definitely had a few people admit they prefer the kelly clarkson cover of its quiet uptown just because its a familiar voice in pop format
hiphopheads,not_removed,what happened to him
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol this wont get overlooked
hiphopheads,not_removed,theater kids will make sure this doesnt get overlooked
hiphopheads,not_removed,came here to say something similar doomtrees one of my favorite collectives her album castor the twin is one of my favorites thrilled she made it on the mixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,dessa is great and youre right she killed it lin had dixons girl on his playlist of songs that influenced his writing during the musical you can definitely hear it in some of the female casts songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,you act like there was any possibility of this being bad the original soundtrack is already great and the released singles were all fantastic
hiphopheads,not_removed,my girl was in musical theater in hs and is in acting school right now and she loves hamilton but doesnt listen much to hip hop she liked mbdtf on her first listen so maybe hamilton helped her out somehow
hiphopheads,not_removed,you better buy your ticket the moment you finish reading this sentence
hiphopheads,not_removed,the sf and la production is a touring show so itll be going all over httpwwwhamiltonbroadwaycomtourphp
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not really something you can just go see on a whim at least on broadway they released tickets for augustnovember and already the only ones left are to
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw it and knew nothing going in was absolutely blown away by the entire thing incredible show
hiphopheads,not_removed,its outstanding ive had some people recommend listening to or reading the lyrics before the show so youre not as focused on the words and can enjoy the entire musical production i saw it without doing so and didnt really have any trouble with the lyrics although i can definitely see why its recommended to read beforehand i would absolutely recommend going
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw it its probably the best play ive ever seen in my life and ive seen a good amount of plays i had heard some of the music before hand but seeing it done live was amazing i think youll enjoy it either way but it is kind of fun to be able to singrap along a little bit
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive been as a hip hop fan first and theatre kid second it was amazing definitely go if you can cop a ticket
hiphopheads,not_removed,i saw it in chicago on the night the cubs won the ws its amazing and that was one of the best nights of my life
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt realize he could sing like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think id listen to the whole song long thing much but theres definitely songs from it ill be listening to for a while
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah hamilton was originally just a concept album in fact lin refers to it being a concept album at his white house performance
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you see hamilton youll realize why its so popular
hiphopheads,not_removed,its basically our generations rent
hiphopheads,not_removed,just listen to the soundtrack man i was hooked immediately
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant answer your first question as i havent seen it or listened to the soundtrack before ive just heard it was good for a musical as for your second question my understanding is that linmanuel miranda the mind behind it is a huge fan of hiphop so id assume he made this because he loves the music and wanted to further drive his own hit project into the genre further away from the musical sort of like the actual hamilton play being a musical album with hiphop elements with this being a hiphop album with musical elements someone who is more knowledgeable on the play can correct me if im wrong though
hiphopheads,not_removed,its part that white people have very little experience with hip hop and part that the show is just good on its own merit plus theres a ton of hype behind it
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly the music in hamilton constantly underwhelms me especially given how much better daveed diggs thomas jeffersonmarquis de lafayettes other music is
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres direct covers remixes and completely new songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep its a mix of covers remixes with different rap verses and newunreleased songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,this feels like an insult am i reading that wrong
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes there are multiple songs that are practically complete covers of songs there are multiple songs that are remixed versions of songs from the show and there are multiple songs that are songs cut from the broadway production if youre wanting to stay pure and not hear anything from the show before seeing it id avoid this mixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes there are a lot of straight covers of songs straight from the musical that said only a few actually spoil anything in the show and thats putting it mildly for the most parts without context you wont really have any idea of how the covers actually pertain to the story of the show
hiphopheads,not_removed,honestly unless you already have tickets or some sort of plan to see it soon i would just listen to it youre going to be waiting a long time and since its sungthrough or rapped through as it were the soundtrack is the entire musical minus one very short scene but do whatever you want im just saying youre missing out on greatness and will be for a while haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wish he was on this too especially on cabinet battle as jefferson at the very least
hiphopheads,not_removed,can you not stand it simply because its popular or have you actually listened to it and dont like it
hiphopheads,not_removed,and knaan i dont know how this subreddit feels about him but it makes so much sense to have him on that song
hiphopheads,not_removed,dozens of us
hiphopheads,not_removed,yep haha same here or at least when i was in high school i was defo the only hip hop fan in the program tho and it felt like everyday my senior year someone would ask me if ive heard ofliked hamilton
hiphopheads,not_removed,represent
hiphopheads,not_removed,theatreopera hhh member here
hiphopheads,not_removed,i am you
hiphopheads,not_removed,no we have to make fun of the ignorant and make sure they feel stupid for not knowing everything
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh yeah im not shit talking them or anything at all hamilton might not be my cup of tea but if people start to dig the genre bc of it then fuck it yknow one love
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres an art school in socal and literally all the theater kids listen to death grips there even before hamilton
hiphopheads,not_removed,with pleasure
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i realized it after i posted but eh its funny haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,she gets the job done
hiphopheads,not_removed,ill have to check em out lots of suggestions here so clearly theres a lot to go through haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,he dropped a pretty good mixtape last year
hiphopheads,not_removed,ill have to check them out among the many other suggestions haha thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,will do theres a lot of suggestions here but ill get to it soon enough thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,will do that title is weird enough for me to look forward to it haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn nas verse was amazing busta sounded great too
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely a similar style i like snows voice a bit more but both a great
hiphopheads,not_removed,watsky and what sounds like a kazoo in the same track
hiphopheads,not_removed,nas is on wrote my way out with lin manuel and dave east but my shot features black thought ortiz anthony hamilton edit aloe blacc and busta who also killed it common and black thought actually are together too on who tells your story
hiphopheads,not_removed,even though it isnt hiphop i think john legend deserves a mention
hiphopheads,not_removed,i am going to be out of commission when comes out but their new songs are great out of so i am kind of worried
hiphopheads,not_removed,smoke dza x pete rock too
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao at these passive aggressive comments damn lovely fucking pleasant
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh trust me ive had that on repeat since i saw the movie too especially him in the credits version of youre welcome besides moana was a pretty fantastic movie my favorite disney movie since mulan
hiphopheads,not_removed,thought it was great for sure just not a stand out to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely fair opinion especially given that leslie odom jrs version is so great
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait for it is one of my favorites from the show so i was really looking forward to hearing usher singing it god damn was i let down i feel like usher halfassed the fuck outta that song and did it no justice dear theodosia and the reprise and burn are really the only direct covers i like
hiphopheads,not_removed,none of the covers were any good wait for it was probably the best but it was basically a worse version of the exact same arrangement as the original so why bother listening to a strictly worse version
hiphopheads,not_removed,a musical about the founding father alexander hamilton starting mostly black and latino actors with a large number of the songs being rapped its been dominating broadway for over a year at like record setting levels and wiped the floor with everyone at the most recent tony awards
hiphopheads,not_removed,hamilton is a broadway musical by lin manuel miranda it uses a mixture of hip hop rampb and rap to tell the story of alexander hamilton one of americas founding fathers it is widely acclaimed for being revolutionary no pun intended as a show which is nearly entirely made up of people of color and for its music there is a soundtrack to the musical which is on every streaming service last i checked that is incredible on its own as the story has almost no dialogue spoken all of it is rapped or sung if youre not looking to devote hours without convincing id say check out the first songs alexander hamilton guns and ships and nonstop to get a good sense of the music if you like that definitely listen to the whole thing it is probably my favorite album i listened to this year
hiphopheads,not_removed,to add some more context theres a lot of people saying that linmanuel is gonna be a legend in the future
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah there was no way for usher to surpass leslie odom jr
hiphopheads,not_removed,whats wrong with it
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive listened to it about times already i love phillipa soos version too but goddamn this girl killed it
hiphopheads,not_removed,its really the only cover i like along with chances dear theodosia everything else is lackluster and i rather just listen to the obc
hiphopheads,not_removed,i actually love the usher wait for it way more than i expected to favorite song in the musical too but something about the way he did it was just a nice take on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,sia was absolutely brutally bad on satisfied took one of my favorite tracks and made me skip it halfway through terrible tone and weird annunciation
hiphopheads,not_removed,he went crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,dessa would absolutely kill it as angelica in a movie version
hiphopheads,not_removed,i liked all the original content but honestly was not struck by covers the cast versions will always be better than a cover by a famous artist especially because youll have context in the musical for songs like its quiet up town
hiphopheads,not_removed,i had the opposite take i had no idea how this possible could be bad given the source material and the features but basically all the covers fucking butchered the original songs only decent tracks were my shot write my way out and who tells your story imo just a lot of horrible out of place over emotive singing some really amateurish beat flips and sample use even producers i generally like such as illmind just fell straight flat take a break interlude sounds like some soundcloud producers first attempt at a sample flip with the most generic rap drums in the history of the genre behind it who tells your story was the quality i was expecting an interesting twist on the original song a very good use of the sample and nice verses by all involved instead we got messes like ashanti and ja rule on helpless or wiz on washingtons on your side really really let down
hiphopheads,not_removed,got a link cant find it with a search
hiphopheads,not_removed,jimmy is actually very very talented theres an interview with louis ck and himself i think where he was auditioning for a movie that louie was directing and he was doing a bunch of different impressions
hiphopheads,not_removed,the songs he used to do on snl weekend update in the style of insert artist here were always solid he can musically imitate almost anyone i also recommend his song the video has a young zooey deschanel
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea for sure
hiphopheads,not_removed,or as a hiphophead just give the soundtrack a listen hamilton the musical is something new in musical theater and its not only new its good it uses hiphop and rb to deliver its story of the founding fathers from the voices of a mostly black cast and finally it appeals to a lot of different audiences because its doing a lot of things its telling a great story its educating its paying homage to great hiphop rb as well as musical theater its also got a great and patriotic message it directly references a lot of classic hiphop tracks like the ten crack commandments it has a deep respect for the history of the genre referencing multiple eras styles of production and flows all seamlessly wrapped into a wonderfully crafted story if youre a fan of musical theater you will also find many references and homages to some of the great musicals and thats just the music and the story it tells which doesnt include the amazing visuals and visual story telling as well as the choreography and every other piece of stage craft that goes into any musical
hiphopheads,not_removed,alright you convinced me link to buy tix
hiphopheads,not_removed,white people
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is good though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like its important to understand that its not gimmicky the show is built around hip hop and rb and using these styles adds to what the show has to say about race and our nations history the show is filled with subtle nods to classic songs fron different eras of hip hop from crack commandments to lose yourself most importantly the hip hop is actually good daveed diggs is amazing on washington on your side if you want a good example the album is up for streaming on spotify and its incredible
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive just heard it was good for a musical rolls eyes
hiphopheads,not_removed,hip hop is pretty new in being combined with musicals as a main focus at least and hamilton does it pretty well with a lot of talented artists in the original cast daveed diggs comes to mind this might be a push into a less mainstream form of hip hop because the stuff on hamilton is pretty vanilla as far as tempo instrumentation pretty much everything else goes but i havent listened to it yet i mean i assume theres a reason its so popular i have an opportunity to buy tickets this month so i might be able to see not even guaranteed i can buy them tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like dismissing the musical as white people having little experience with hip hop is a huge disservice to the show its an incredible show and its not really a novelty or culture clash that makes it that way
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know plenty of people of color who love the musical i do think that its partially the novelty factor but it stands as a great hiphop musical
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love the show but ive definitely seen too many comments from white people on social media talking about how theyre so glad hip hop is being used to tell more positive messages implying theyve bothered to check out a remotely significant amount of hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel you ive tried listening to the soundtrack multiple times and my wife loves it but she loves musicals and doesnt like rap much im the exact opposite i think hamilton has great moments where it focuses in on the rap aspect and forgets it is a musical but when it walks that tightrope of having these like big show tune songs with rap in it i just kind of cringe at times because it sounds awkward to me but every time i say something negative about hamilton i automatically get down voted so it is what it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,direct covers remixes demos completely new songs and songs that are reminiscent of ones on the soundtrack but not quite the same if you want to be exhaustive haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,my mom is excited for this mixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,an insult to whom
hiphopheads,not_removed,great thank you for the input exactly what i wanted to know
hiphopheads,not_removed,great thank you for the info
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have listened to it and the production of it is weak and corny and the lyricism and flow feel forced and awkward its a complete fumbling of a decent idea in my opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,sub used to like him until his last album and his disappearance from music
hiphopheads,not_removed,ugh i remember kids like you from high school who considered anything outside of hiphop whack broaden your catalog man
hiphopheads,not_removed,how is it corny
hiphopheads,not_removed,you sound so fun to be around with
hiphopheads,not_removed,dozens
hiphopheads,not_removed,i remember one of the people in my company sent me hamilton and was like i heard you like the rap whaddya think to be fair i enjoyed it and really like hamilton to this day
hiphopheads,not_removed,httpiimgurcomciehvuljpg
hiphopheads,not_removed,hamilton shows how hypocritical a lot of hip hop fans are and its really frustrating theres been rude comments here about how fans of hamilton dont know anything about rap and theyre ignorant like dude of you dont know shit about musical theatre i hope the musical theatre fans that try to get into rap dont run into people like you guys youre doing a disservice to the genre when you act like that but still want to bitch about people not understanding hip hop or respecting the genre
hiphopheads,not_removed,really cant take a joke huh
hiphopheads,not_removed,it sounded like it was a joke chill
hiphopheads,not_removed,sorry bro i wasnt trying to make fun of them at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,do you know the temperature of the suns core no haha loser
hiphopheads,not_removed,check out guns and ships
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont listen to much of snow tha product but i remember song featuring cyhi was in my rotation for a while a couple years back
hiphopheads,not_removed,i only found the song because some guy did a breakdown of nas verse something about the theory behind it being absurd great track glad you liked it
hiphopheads,not_removed,so watsky
hiphopheads,not_removed,i do not believe anthony hamilton appears on my shot
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean awaken my love isnt really hiphop either
hiphopheads,not_removed,to me the best songs are the ones that were reinvented with new verses or new ideas i wish more artists took liberties
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think the only way to make the mixtape version of wait for it a standout would have been to completely reenvision it because leslie odom jrs version of the song is so damn phenomenal anything in a similar style is just going to sound like karaoke good karaoke for sure usher has talent but it just pales in comparison imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,it doesnt seem to be a popular opinion but i also really like the fallon cover obviously he doesnt hold a candle to groft but im a big fan of the new arrangements
hiphopheads,not_removed,i actually really liked both versions of dear theodosia and i thought fallons version of youll be back was kind of fun
hiphopheads,not_removed,it didnt win scenic design though so its understandable if people dont want to see it ireallywanttoseeit
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn its been there for over a year i was lookin at buying my sister some tickets but then prices too high
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk its obviously less authentic but i would never expect a project with black thought common nas and john legend to be bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,i like some of the covers not better than the originals but they are damn good and when my family is sick of me listening to hamilton i can play these and theyll ve none the wiser
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn you didnt like wizs part i thought it was pretty good i get what youre saying about the production though i was listening on some actually good headphones today and it honestly sounded a lot worse than when i was listening to it last night i still think it was overall pretty good but maybe thats because im not as familiar with the original soundtrack i listened a few times and enjoyed it though i didnt go into something called a mixtape expecting it to be really cohesive or anything so it was less disappointing for me when you had guys like ja rule coming in sounding completely different than anybody on immigrants or jill scott you could easily tell who put more thought into their parts though so it makes the lows really stand out
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was for the dana carvey show
hiphopheads,not_removed,is there a way to see it yet like a vod or official recording id love to see it live but im poor
hiphopheads,not_removed,i got u bro paypal me and a copy of you passport and ssn and maybe i can find some no guarantees
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh my sweet summer child
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres a bootleg out there fam and itll eventually be on some streaming service in good quality according to linmanuels hints
hiphopheads,not_removed,just stream the album its available on spotify and its fuckin great
hiphopheads,not_removed,no i dont think thats why its so popular keep trying though
hiphopheads,not_removed,its going to age similarly poorly once the novelty of rappin founding fathers wears off its super wack in a specific way that its sort of socially acceptable now but as values change itll be brought down by its inherent wackness imo at least
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i wasnt trying to imply it was gimmicky my first statement was me just saying straight up what ive heard about it and from what ive heard its good i just havent had the time or motivation to listen through it yet i was more focused on answering as to why he would make this mixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah like compared to other musicals many people were enjoying this one more whats the problem
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres a bunch of other hip hop musicals and none of them took off like this like there was a pac one before this
hiphopheads,not_removed,obviously the show has won a ton of awards but the hip hop factor is a massive reason its so popular
hiphopheads,not_removed,i certainly disagree
hiphopheads,not_removed,splendor misery is like halfway to being a broadway musical tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,see that would be awesome tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,need me some scifi life extending technology cause thats something i wanna see
hiphopheads,not_removed,directed at hamilton like only moms like this ya know calling it lame but i wasnt sure because maybe his mom just likes good music
hiphopheads,not_removed,alright well i and many others disagree but youre entitled to your opinion the one thing i would say is that you need to remember its a musical first and hiphop second
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont even get what youre saying when you say the production is weak and corny the music was done by an objectively talented tony award winning composer
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao lets drop buzzwords to sound legitimate
hiphopheads,not_removed,not liking hamilton doesnt mean you dont have a broad catalog but its a cute ad hominem some of us love hip hop for what it is and what its done as well as loving other genres and forms of art for what they are sometimes mashing shit together works at other times its corny af but people wont acknowledge it for whatever reason if youd like to go catalog for catalog for rights to comment on the hamilton mixtape and musical id be happy
hiphopheads,not_removed,every single hardcore hamilton fan ive met in real life is unbearably obnoxious
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah word i think i said this below but even if hamilton isnt my cup of tea i still respect what its done for hip hop and shit love how lin is unashamedly a fan of the kind of hip hop a lot of people would typically be put off by yknow im sure a lot of people out there have watched one of his interviews then gone off to listen to like mobb deep or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think my issue and at least some of the people heres issue with hamilton is not that the music isnt awesome but rather that people use hamilton as an example of exceptional hiphop because it doesnt talk about drugs guns hoes etc will hamilton and this mixtape get some musical theater people to check out hiphop sure but i cant stand the people ive already heard saying that theyd actually listen to and like hiphop if it were all like hamilton instead of about being dumb and committing crimes
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont get that type of attitude if someone wants to get into the music that i like i gladly introduce them to more stuff because there is nothing in it for me to be elitist about it and besides were all clueless about some of these things like id embarrass myself if i tried to talk about theatre and musicals but hopefully if i was talking to the right people they would have been cool about it
hiphopheads,not_removed,the funny thing is understanding musical theatre will lend you a better understanding of music than the other way around i didnt appreciate hip hop as much as after i immersed myself with the all star hits like wicked book of mormon lion king and even legally blonde but of course niggas here wanna be cool and not listen to anything that has musical in the title not realizing its actually harming their continuous learning of music
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah but rap is actually good
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats nice i feel like i should be cruising around with the window down right now but its waaaaaay too cold for that
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre right i meant aloe blacc i had hamilton on the mind
hiphopheads,not_removed,if hhh can post about blonde all the time then we can post about awaken my love ps i love blonde and copped the black friday vinyl
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree although its more accepted in to completely change verses in rap than it is with purely vocal songs i like the ones that made it their own quite a bit but ill be damned if sia didnt kill it here and hers was a bit more true to the source
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont like chances voice so while the arrangement was nice the fact that reprise is entirely based on him sing basically is a dealbreaker from the start the first dear theodosia was fine but nothing close to the original fallons version is fine in a gimmick sort of way the type of thing that is fun for a skit on his show or something but not as an actual song
hiphopheads,not_removed,my dad actually just managed to get me and him good seats to see it next september and i really dont know what to do with myself until then
hiphopheads,not_removed,how does he write like hes running out of time
hiphopheads,not_removed,i didnt expect it to be bad lol we all good
hiphopheads,not_removed,im not making complaints about the mixtapes cohesion i mean it follows fairly closely to the storyline of a broadway play not sure how much more cohesive you can reasonably get than that im making complaints about its quality washingtons on your side is better than your average wiz verse but he still came with some of the most predictable wiz lines of all time coupled with the lamest most obvious twist he could have put on that chorus
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah thats it thanks for the spotify mirror edit for the ctrlf crowd
hiphopheads,not_removed,no official recording unfortunately so your best legal way of experiencing it is listening to the cast album and using your imagination to fill in whats missing
hiphopheads,not_removed,k
hiphopheads,not_removed,lin has confirmed that there is a recording of the original cast performing the show but it will be years before we see that unless you live in nyc and are studying something relevant to theater then you can go to the library where its available and request to see it the business of live theater is very conscious of limiting competition a college program near me recently had to abandon the show they were planning because it was returning to broadway meaning the price of being allowed to perform it would be astronomical since hamilton is still on broadway and has a travelling show a chicago show and a london show in production it will be a long time before that recording becomes available
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree i find the hamilton circle jerk funny and i feel like history will not be good to it its gonna age horribly since its just very corny
hiphopheads,not_removed,i misunderstood when you say it had good music for a musical that sounds negative like saying youre cute for a black guy i see what you mean though i am unrolling my eyes
hiphopheads,not_removed,because those werent that good its pretty simple linmanuel miranda is one of the best songwriters period right now not just anyone can take a rap musical and make it work
hiphopheads,not_removed,let us not forget about carmen a hip hopera
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly because the hip hop in the show is really really good not because white people dont listen to much hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,have you seen it lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah the fact that hip hop fans dont see theyre doing literally the exact same thing when they say fuck musicals but hamilton is pretty good is incredibly annoying
hiphopheads,not_removed,id say its a little different because theres often an element of think because hip hop is black music it must be about violence drugs sex etc i do agree that more hip hop fans should give musical theatre chance theres some brilliant lyricists at work
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think it forgets that it is one either but what im talking about is there are times like duel commandments where it focuses in on the rap aspect and i think its one of the great moments for me but then there are other moments where the rap meeting with the more musical broadway aspect i feel doesnt mesh well i never said it had to be one or the other
hiphopheads,not_removed,i read it as a fact facts arent really insults they can be either encouraging or discouraging because of how telling they are about the underlying truth but theyre still facts his mom is excited about the hamilton mixtape
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmm out spit nas
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank u for being the only sane people in this thread lol the whole thing seems like its built of the novelty of mixing hip hop wow black people and history wow so patriotic rather than any actual good lyrics the lines are so fucking cheesy
hiphopheads,not_removed,every hardcore fan of anything is unbearably obnoxious see kanye stans
hiphopheads,not_removed,hamilton is one step away from nerdcore hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive already heard saying that theyd actually listen to and like hiphop if it were all like hamilton instead of about being dumb and committing crimes and those people are ignorant great that has nothing to do with hamilton if linmanuel miranda heard someone say that hed chew them out and you can open a dialogue with those people i dont know if youve tried
hiphopheads,not_removed,but rather that people use hamilton as an example of exceptional hiphop because it doesnt talk about drugs guns hoes etc theres a song about alex being disloyal and getting finessed
hiphopheads,not_removed,agreed i would add that theres often an element of racial bias in these views of hiphop because of people assuming that because its black music it must be about violence drugs sex etc and thats why i think that type of ignorance about hip hop is a little worse than the ignorance about theatre even if the racial bias isnt malicious or intentional which it most often isnt in life in general
hiphopheads,not_removed,but rather that people use hamilton as an example of exceptional hiphop because it doesnt talk about drugs guns hoes etc say no to this is a song about hamilton cheating on his wife and the ten duel commandments is all about the process of having an illegal duel theres still violence and sex in hamilton its just handled very tactfully theres nothing wrong with that you cant really say people like hamilton because its hip hop that doesnt talk about guns when hamiltons claim to fame before this was getting shot in a duel
hiphopheads,not_removed,musical theatre fans have much less of a chip on their shoulder youd be fine hip hops fans have gone through decades of it not being considered a legitimate art form so people have become jaded and elitist
hiphopheads,not_removed,not that deep at all fam
hiphopheads,not_removed,or musical theater sounds like corny bulshit
hiphopheads,not_removed,til that all rap is actually good and all musical theater isnt
hiphopheads,not_removed,got tickets for july a few months back and now im just lost
hiphopheads,not_removed,i meant its quality varies too much shouldve said consistency instead of cohesive this sub just uses that word so much it got stuck i thought it started off really strong but then the jimmy fallon track was just whack alicia keys bored me ja rule was grating on his track and looking back there were a lot more lows than highs i didnt think many of the tracks were particularly bad just unimpressive after i let it sit for a whole day the really good tracks make the boring jill scott alicia keys etc tracks sound worse than they actually are imo honestly i was more impressed by wiz cuz i almost never listen to him so i dont really know what a good verse by him sounds like this was above average than the usual stuff i hear from him at least
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats what makes me sad about plays is that you gotta be willing to drop a lot of dough to see it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i appreciate your insight thanks for clearing that up for me
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats the point i was tryna make
hiphopheads,not_removed,they also didnt take off because they didnt appeal to bougie white people like hamilton does look its black people playing the founding fathers how cute and wholesome
hiphopheads,not_removed,to be fair in the heights also by lin manuel miranda was pretty good too
hiphopheads,not_removed,its about white people sure but theres only one white actor in the play where the characters were all actually white so that might take away some of the safe access youre talking about
hiphopheads,not_removed,ah yeah youre right would be dope to see a performance of it even if it wasnt broadway
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah thats why i asked i didnt want to unfairly attack himher
hiphopheads,not_removed,i meanyeah kind of we sure as hell arent talking about a grammy
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol why are you being downvoted using tony award winning as a justification for something hiphop being good is a complete joke and proof of how misdirected this whole hamilton hype is the fucking grammys cant even get hip hop right the heist vs gkmc as one of many glaring examples and we are supposed to think this is hot cus the guy won a tony and knows the most obvious golden era rap albums as anyone who grew up in nyc at the time black white or orange does in years people will be embarrassed to have given hamilton all this love
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a musical about the founding fathers it is nerdcore still respect it though
hiphopheads,not_removed,i may have phrased my post poorly but i dont blame hamilton for ignorance being present i just have mild resentment for it being a tool for ignorant people to put down a genre of music thats rich in personal emotional content id be lying if i said my shot werent my jam
hiphopheads,not_removed,the ten duel commandments is an homage to the ten crack commandments as well
hiphopheads,not_removed,and thats why i think that type of ignorance about hip hop is a little worse than the ignorance about theatre even if the racial bias isnt malicious or intentional which it most often isnt in life in general im not disagreeing with anything you just said it just amuses me how hip hop fans expect people to really dig into the genre to find stuff that they like and they claim people are ignorant if they dont do so however they rarely extend that same courtesy to other genres of music rock every so often musical theatre fuck no which is odd because when it comes to storytelling clever lyrics wordplay etc theyre actually very similar but you wouldnt know that if you didnt give it a chance
hiphopheads,not_removed,to dive in a bit further i think the critique against hip hop is that it glorifies casual sex violence etc whereas in hamilton hes not being lauded as being a player the affair undermines and exposes him and highlights his arrogance the violence too comes at a cost and burr isnt a hotshot for winning the violence is portrayed as getting in the way of hamilton achieving more
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha theres corny bullshit rap out there too dont get it twisted
hiphopheads,not_removed,sounds about right
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh sorry
hiphopheads,not_removed,see and its this type of ignorance which is why i cant help but laugh when hip hop fans complain about people not respecting the genre whilst being so elitist and downright dickish to other genres why does everyone that likes hamilton have to be a bougie white person
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats a very good point
hiphopheads,not_removed,and sometimes those rap verses dont mesh well in rb songs and some do im not saying it has to be strictly one or the other im just saying the parts i feel it focuses on the rap shine for me the song where jefferson and hamilton basically rap battle was great the first song before the ending part was great but sometimes i just feel it doesnt always work
hiphopheads,not_removed,she courted me escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner thats when reynolds extorted me for a sordid fee i paid him quarterly i may have mortally wounded my prospects but my papers are orderly ughhhhhhh
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah hamilton is absolutely nerdcore but its done well enough to get away with i
hiphopheads,not_removed,i completely agree with you as a fan of musical theatre aspiring actor and hip hop im feeling a little resentment on both ends because i have experienced what youre talking about and it does annoy me but im also getting annoying by the hip hop fans that want people to be super open to their genre but talk shit about musical theatre or even talk shit about hamilton because bougie white people like it and its corny both sides are fucking stupid as hell
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive had a passing interest in hip hop for years via guys like flobots astronautilus and doomtree hamilton has helped turn me onto a lot of guys like riz mc and helped turn my ear towards flow its definitely helped me press deeper into the genre not just put it down
hiphopheads,not_removed,cabinet battle has cuss words drug references and even a not so sneaky diss to jefferson regarding slavery
hiphopheads,not_removed,the thing is people detract from hip hops messageimportance because they hear one nigga or bitch and tune the rest out nobody really has a warped view of theater like that maybe of theater kids but not plays themselves a lot of people just havent exposed themselves to musical theater as opposed to people who hear hip hop on the radio in passing and assume its a trash genre about flaunting your wealth
hiphopheads,not_removed,did the man who invented college go to college
hiphopheads,not_removed,hey man i listen to a lot of genres and im an elitist dick about all of them dont try to pigeonhole me here
hiphopheads,not_removed,eh no it really doesnt
hiphopheads,not_removed,it seems a lot of people seem to be talking about the show and have not actually listened to it how shocking
hiphopheads,not_removed,nobody really has a warped view of theater like that and thats just simply not true theres people here talking about how musicals and hamilton are just for bougie old white people a lot of people just havent exposed themselves to musical theater but they have a perception of what it is ask someone to sing broadway and theyll put on a deep baritone and start singing a fake showtune thats not what every musical is like
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol fair enough doesnt make you said any less ignorant
hiphopheads,not_removed,the flow internal rhyme and the lyrics themselves are just really cheesy and irritating to me what rap do you normally listen to for perspective
hiphopheads,not_removed,welcome to reddit lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,people are talking about the fans though not the show everyone realizes that linmanuel miranda isnt racist in the least and probably is a big hip hop fan people just resent the whole well i usually hate hip hop but hamilton is amazing crowd ive run into a few people like that personally and it can be frustrating when theyre outright dismissive of the whole genre otherwise though ive also met plenty of fans who arent like that at all of course its the same sort of hate resentment people have for macklemore or watsky fans macklemore is probably the best example too since he pretty clearly has an appreciation for hip hop in the way that miranda does hes just in his own space its the subset of generally ignorant fans that people resent even if it somehow spills over onto the artist sometimes you dont need to have listened to the show to dislike that sort of fan im not saying there arent plenty of equally ignorant hip hop fans the other way either just explaining the sentiment
hiphopheads,not_removed,or it shows that no ones actually making the claim op is saying
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with you to an extent check my reply to the other guy who replied to me i dont feel like typing it out again
hiphopheads,not_removed,very true but cheesy isnt really a death sentence the same way pointless braggadocios brutish are for people who dislike hip hop one is saying yeah this isnt for me its too corny and the other is saying this is bad music with a bad message
hiphopheads,not_removed,how is what i said ignorant hamilton tickets are like a million bucks broadway as an institution is largely run and funded by and for bougie white people hamilton is no different
hiphopheads,not_removed,no it really isnt dude you obviously havent listened to it stop digging this hole
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i think thats totally fair as a lover of both rap and musical theatre i just wish people were a bit more accepting on the hip hop side because as fans of a genre that has been dragged through the dirt for decades i expect us to be better than that
hiphopheads,not_removed,who
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was expecting this to be wack it was content lyricism delivery beat however i could dig waste of a good beat sounded like a year olds first freestyle

hiphopheads,not_removed,clickbait title bruhobviously it worked and obviously i was overexaggerating
hiphopheads,not_removed,ppl generally have an expectation for a song thats posted by unknown artists i felt that it was far beyond whats expected from one of those pplthe title was meant to bait to you come listen and it worked
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree without the title you wouldnt have gotten the upvotes you have
hiphopheads,not_removed,nope
hiphopheads,not_removed,no they arent lmao just this guy
hiphopheads,not_removed,the fun threads are always deleted

hiphopheads,not_removed,bucket list is probably my second favorite album of the year right after blonde side note you might was to repost this at a different time it probably wont get much attention this late at night and you should post it as grown adolecense yes feat saba or the mods might take the post down and im sure the rest of the sub would love to hear this song
hiphopheads,not_removed,cool af
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats cool as shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,would it be too personal if i asked how much the price was

hiphopheads,not_removed,dont fall for it
hiphopheads,not_removed,lyric chains suck
hiphopheads,not_removed,lyric chains are for year olds
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant even spell it right gj
hiphopheads,not_removed,i posted it like that with and it got no love so i took the post down and made this one i dont wanna be too much a pest to the forum and keep reposting the song but if you think that will help itd b awesome if you posted it for me when you think it would prosper lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,lowkey yea lmao the price is the least important part anyway haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,i will say tho its nothing too bad not like i dropped hella racks on it
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you for asking it
hiphopheads,not_removed,its like as of this summer this guy probably paid less since he met him and spoke with him it may be higher now that bucketlist is out
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,max dude i srsly been appreciating all of the support recently need to catch up with you me and miguel will definitely down for an existential conversation or some shit lol also apologetically white is the most accurate name ive ever seen on a forum lol

hiphopheads,not_removed,yeai dont necessarily thinks its beyond your wildest dreams but i think it was a really good song so i talked it up
hiphopheads,not_removed,fun threads
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont like lyric chains but banning things because theyre annoying is really dumb not to mention this is a music related subreddit some lyric chains are completely natural and not annoying in the context
hiphopheads,not_removed,so does lil yachty but they still let his shit in here
hiphopheads,not_removed,and default subs
hiphopheads,not_removed,care to explain why whats so wrong with em
hiphopheads,not_removed,u know im playing baby but godfrey can eat a dik fr
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol its no problem ill try and remember to post it tomorrow
hiphopheads,not_removed,sorry ive gotten curious about guest verses since seeing a video by genius on ig about how much kendrick charges per verse and how much he possibly made this year just off that im on my phone ill try to post it if i find it edit video in question httpsinstagramcompblrfjqsjqqf
hiphopheads,not_removed,so how much
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you for coming through
hiphopheads,not_removed,just curious how do you know this
hiphopheads,not_removed,absolutely my man im for real proud and pumped for your continuous moves being made lets absolutely link up some time
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol and thanks i thought so too
hiphopheads,not_removed,haha senior chance was always rapping in the hallways and shit he paved the way for jones artists
hiphopheads,not_removed,is it gonna be posted on the same soundcloud i really enjoyed the song
hiphopheads,not_removed,looking forward to it
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah until you seem them in every thread then youd change your mind
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyre corny and stupid and the most unnecessary form of comment in existence
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol thanksill deadass message you about it or something if need b haha
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like this video isnt very accurate with how me much he made i dont think he wouldve charged kanye or any of his close friends
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive seen the video lmaohe charges nowhere near what kendrick costs lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,from some quick googling it looks like he was charging back in so i wouldnt be surprised if its higher now
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have friends in the industry who have artists that either will feature or inquired about featuring him
hiphopheads,not_removed,yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah man thats the difference between you and me i dont take this website seriously enough to advocate banning something just because it annoys me thats what self centered douchebags do
hiphopheads,not_removed,says youi think theyre pretty funif executed properly
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol turns out i was completely wrong anyway glad your song is getting attention its really dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah their own statement towards the end kinda makes the whole video lose any validity but non the less it still had me wondering
hiphopheads,not_removed,that would be absurd if he did but maybe one day
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh thats pretty cool ive always thought being in the industry would be interesting getting to speak with so many artists and stuff like that
hiphopheads,not_removed,also anywhere to buydownload
hiphopheads,not_removed,or people who want to look for quality comments about music they enjoy and listen to instead of lyric chains that expand over a page for no real reason
hiphopheads,not_removed,na theyre objectively stupid and if you think theyre fun you must be incredibly boring
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah its dope man if you want you can pm me about how to start to get involved
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,uhhh we working on something ill get back to u
hiphopheads,not_removed,just dont look at that fucking thread then dumbass theres a reason you can minimize a chain of comments with a single button i dont think a lyric chain or two will throw a wrench in your noble search for quality comments
hiphopheads,not_removed,awesome man this is definitely going in my playlist excited to hear more work
hiphopheads,not_removed,im sorry you feel that way and have a hard on for lyric chains for some reason part of the problem with what youre telling me is that its impossible to tell if theres a lyric chain before opening the thread
hiphopheads,not_removed,hella heat soon
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is an old travis leak sounds way better
hiphopheads,not_removed,ty is one of my favs artists out right now all he puts out is fucking gold cant wait for campaign
hiphopheads,not_removed,when you see fresh and travis but its not birds
hiphopheads,not_removed,was just listening to the leaked version today between this and tourist its interesting to see how travis distributes his music
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like sometimes mike dean or whoever goes overboard with the effects on travis songs i prefer the leak tbh ty dolla sign is good but i think travis did it better when he did the whole song by himself how does that work did he just rerecord the stuff travis did and travis let him have the song or what i was really annoyed with the final version of wonderful the original version with just travis was so much better wish theyd release a cdq of that version
hiphopheads,not_removed,the production on this is unbelievable
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok that outro is crazy though
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,man both the singles this album are so repetitive but theyre so damn catchy as well really enjoying this production i wonder if the success of work inspired others to utilize that songwriting philosophy in the poprb lane
hiphopheads,not_removed,i have listened to the leaked version of this song so much honestly one of my favorite travis songs just for the melody and the flow i am liking this version as well birds hype is real
hiphopheads,not_removed,enough to hold me over til birds tmm
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is so lit i have two boners
hiphopheads,not_removed,how long does it usually take for an album to become illegaly available asking because im doing a school project about pirating dont pm me links pls
hiphopheads,not_removed,at least travis is still making bank even if his tracks leak
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,yooo i felt like i just had one of the best eargasms ever listening to this the multiple changes in the beat and the infectious melodies from both travis and ty had my hand ever my mouth the whole track the leak is peanuts compared to this one
hiphopheads,not_removed,i prefer the travis leak tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is dope but i would have enjoyed it more if ty only rapped over the parts where travis was mumbling in the original leak would have liked first verse much more if travis did the whole thing
hiphopheads,not_removed,hitboy production thoooooo
hiphopheads,not_removed,the opening womp beat gently tingles my ear hair and it pleases me
hiphopheads,not_removed,the og leaked version of this is still in rotation for me tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,such a lazy track afterparty sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah this is dope the raw leaked version was getting pretty popular so wouldnt be surprised if this is at least somewhat of a hit smart move by ty too
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah im with you the leak was really simple in terms of production but that made it standout it was evident it was really barebones but this final version feels like it has a bit too much going on i definitely prefer the leaks intro to this one and im not sold on the outro man i wish i could see what travis would have done with it but overall its not too bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,same free tc was pretty good just some filler
hiphopheads,not_removed,man i been fucking with him recently what would you say is his best project havent checked any out yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive been waiting for mins where this shit at
hiphopheads,not_removed,the sauciest man right here
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree i respect mike dean as a producer but especially in this the echo is just kind of annoying and theres sooo much of it
hiphopheads,not_removed,ugh i had finally gotten over wonderful being ruined in the official mix but you just reminded me the original was way better before the weeknd hopped on and travis had his vocal mixed all funky
hiphopheads,not_removed,hasnt been that long
hiphopheads,not_removed,all of the singles off of campaign have been lazy to me
hiphopheads,not_removed,the intro lord knows stretch she better cant stay like i do insert girlfriend controversial opinion ty dolla ign is the new rick james fight me
hiphopheads,not_removed,paranoid ep is the best work ever
hiphopheads,not_removed,you can tell hes great based on all the different responses you should just really check out his entire discography hes a singer so he always sounds good and his music is super easy to get into
hiphopheads,not_removed,free tc is his most complete work
hiphopheads,not_removed,airplane mode
hiphopheads,not_removed,beach house ep easily
hiphopheads,not_removed,not supposed to come out tonight will likely drop around wav radio episode tomorrow
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive been waiting for five minutes bitch ive been waiting for months
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol i see trab i will talk about trab foh
hiphopheads,not_removed,you lame bro go home
hiphopheads,not_removed,or they were poorly shared when sold and ended up leaking
hiphopheads,not_removed,the original wonderful track had me hyped for so many months and once the cdq came out i was so sadstill listen to the live version i hope when left cheek right cheek comes out it doenst get the same fate as wonderful
hiphopheads,not_removed,rick james rick james was a bastard though ty may or may not have made some mistakes but hes never raped and tortured a woman insofar as i know
hiphopheads,not_removed,years
hiphopheads,not_removed,im a bot if you have any suggestions you can message my creator here
hiphopheads,not_removed,what
hiphopheads,not_removed,fixing wolves
hiphopheads,not_removed,may have something to do with the license for it expiring today a year since it came out right maybe they forgot to reup it
hiphopheads,not_removed,still up in the uk edit just checked on the spotify api it has these listed as the available countries which i think is everywhere with spotify except the us ad ar at au be bg bo br ch cl co cr cy cz de dk do ec ee es fi fr gb gr gt hk hn hu id ie is it jp li lt lu lv mc mt my ni nl no nz pa pe ph pl pt py se sg sk sv tr tw uy

hiphopheads,not_removed,kush and oj acid rap dbr detroit friday night lights live love asap nostalgia ultra

hiphopheads,not_removed,coloring book welcome to forever
hiphopheads,not_removed,faces
hiphopheads,not_removed,its ok but possibly the most overrated tape ever on this sub honestly its about songs too long
hiphopheads,not_removed,i really appreciate lowercase calling me gay in a private message
hiphopheads,not_removed,never knew how good this guy is live legit sounds like a studio recording
hiphopheads,not_removed,im never going to get to see a dipset reunion show 🌊🌊🌊
hiphopheads,not_removed,to me it actually doesnt have as much replay value as nothing was the same or even iyrtitl of the album are basically drake covers of weeknd songs i think his other albums even views are more original and will stand the test of time more than take care
hiphopheads,not_removed,take care doesnt age well at all its just such a good album an outdated sound the same with nwts that felt like a project recorded and sat on for a while iyrtitl feels more original than views for me people will look back on last spring and summer and the way that tape changed the culture and that is what drake will be remembered for imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,part is my fav its worth listening to the others though i think theres or something
hiphopheads,not_removed,part is the most popular part is my personal favorite
hiphopheads,not_removed,bro hes copying desiigners style

hiphopheads,not_removed,a p r i l s t
hiphopheads,not_removed,you should know that top likes to talk in multiple tweets shouldve waited until you saw all of em
hiphopheads,not_removed,congratulations
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes average also this is gonna get removed save it for the daily discussion thread
hiphopheads,not_removed,how fucking lit is this hes trying to push more futuretravis skott kind of sound in to russian rap and the genre is actually blowing up thing is though when you rap about pussy money etc in russian it sounds really corny to russian speaking people but they are getting more and more used to it which is great cus i see alot of potential production is fucking nuts
hiphopheads,not_removed,i would pay a great sum of money for a mad sweatshirt album
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know this is posted too much but i love this song so much ill hit it with the upvote
hiphopheads,not_removed,tbh this song got me into doom as soon as i heard it madvillany finally clicked and im listening to doomsday now
hiphopheads,not_removed,that artwork is fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks havent heard it before it this
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn that acid burn when it clean ya i still miss being a senior and performing at all those open mic events high schools eyes closed seeing arenas
hiphopheads,not_removed,im always impressed if i see people perform a song without the beatmelody not only is it harder to time the flow but it also takes way more courage and confidence may not be a big deal thinking that chance has performed in front of many sold out crowds but back then he hadnt yet but you could feel his confidence nonetheless
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is my fav chance song and its so rare to find go vids of him preforming him thanks for posting this
hiphopheads,not_removed,fun fact he never went back to school
hiphopheads,not_removed,you can just tell chanos personality from this super great vid he just laughs off forgetting part of the third verse this is perfect
hiphopheads,not_removed,but just remember that i did this

hiphopheads,not_removed,bones is so fucking consistent especially for how often he releases shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,where is a good place to start with bones ive heard a select few tracks that i really like but he has so much on soundcloud i never know where to begin
hiphopheads,not_removed,great as usual
hiphopheads,not_removed,bombsinthelunchroom is fire
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you run the beat through a visualizer it shows
hiphopheads,not_removed,yourmusicsucksandyoulooklikeadickhead

hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,uifuhadazuneihateyou would probably agree with you
hiphopheads,not_removed,the amount of times hes said kek on twitter is pretty high when he gets on his rants also im pretty sure he even says it out loud during one song from
hiphopheads,not_removed,no
hiphopheads,not_removed,its cause all his shit sounds the same lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,just do powder its definitely his most welcome put together project that gives a full look at his style minus the awesome jazzy uncle ricky cuts on his other tapes
hiphopheads,not_removed,start with his tape with xavier wulf then just listen to the rest of his shit from there all his shits good
hiphopheads,not_removed,deadboy mixtape very cohesive and consistently good sixteen calcium timesharecondominium are my favorite songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol at everyone giving you like all his albums powders a good start bte but honestly you could probably jump into any album and if you like it youll like the rest of his shit if not you probably wont
hiphopheads,not_removed,paid programming and useless were pretty good but im a pretty recent fan so i dont know all his albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to rotten my favorite and his best project imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,wtf lol did she miscarry or something i dont get it
hiphopheads,not_removed,ifyouhadazuneihateyou
hiphopheads,not_removed,everyalbumhasaninterludesothisismine
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuckin love that title orderwhatyouwantiwilltakethepepperonisoff
hiphopheads,not_removed,ay yeah i do bones song titles are great
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol like what he mainly talks about suicide depression fucking girls and doing drugs and thats okay its his lane but nothing substantial
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont see a problem
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not true at all
hiphopheads,not_removed,waaaaan
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol seriously every comment was a different album but thanks im gonna check out all his stuff
hiphopheads,not_removed,you got it actually its become infamous as the worst strip from the worst webcomic ever made
hiphopheads,not_removed,spooky black destroyed this
hiphopheads,not_removed,my roommate has a zune he still uses it every day so fucking smug about it too
hiphopheads,not_removed,zune was tight i got one in high school for like bucks because some kid wanted an ipod shit made my life coming from an ipod shuffle
hiphopheads,not_removed,hahaha
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay you clearly dont listen to bones too funny
hiphopheads,not_removed,it honestly is though its just up to you how you take it good or bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,its pretty true even though he has variated from his style in the past most of his songs sound similar to this i like his style so idc but if i listened to him adamantly enough i feel like i would eventually tire over how similar the vast majority of his music is once again i like him probably one of my most listened to rappers right now and god damn does he have a lot to listen to but i can see someone saying its all similar
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn yeah nothing else made sense lol but yeah definitely a weird pointless comic lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol i do listen to him and xavier and kenshin and its true bones doesnt rap about anything substantial
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol those songs deal with the exact same shit depression shit like that bones is one of the most dimensional rappers to ever grace a mic
hiphopheads,not_removed,its just straight up not true he has plenty of variation in his discography httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfjqfbuwlyzg httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfjqfbuwlyzg httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdpgxyxwhczm httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnklkscobbi httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuebqpjvihm he certainly has a sound but that doesnt mean variation doesnt exist his most recent albums useless and notably both feature huge departures from his normal delivery style
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats actually just your opinion mate substantial is entirely subjective but honestly very very few of his songs are about fucking girls and the only drug he talks about is weed so im still finding it a little hard to believe youve heard more than a few songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah youre right there is variation but for me personally as a fan of bones for years now his music is beginning to stagnate cause i dont feel like it varies enough to stay interesting maybe just me though all opinions and such
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah theres variation but its always in the same way and that memphis stuff he made as tha kid isnt what he makes now its literally brooding melancholy bass soft singing that rapid fire flow he does the slow deep voice or screaming sometimes a jazzy beat its always the same to me and i disagree his last tapes are all the exact same sound from youshouldhaveseenyourface all the way up its just that moody internet music shit again i mean at least he has a defined sound but it got old to me at least chris travis and xavier wulf have genuinely explored different sounds on almost every tape instrumental wise
hiphopheads,not_removed,do you fanboys who come in and post a dozen links to win an argument actually think youre changing anyones mind its pretty much the worst online debate tactic ever
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol substantial is not entirely subjective the fuck you talking about kendrick lamar raps about substantial shit wiz khalifa does not its simple believe what you want he has very few songs about fucking girls but almost every verse of his has a line like im with your bitch she in my crib and we smoking weed and if you think the only drug he talks about is weed than youre the one thats not listening lol but thats his lane
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes kind of right though ive heard every bones tape since creep and he pretty much always raps about the same shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,bro i dont need to open my mind i already listen to bonesxaviers my favorite tho but lets not pretend like hes rapping about important shit
hiphopheads,not_removed,beats calling dudes fanboys basically saying im stubborn lazy so fuck those links
hiphopheads,not_removed,no it is there are plenty of people who could give a fuck less about conscious rap thats not substantial to them there are also plenty of people who dont relate to lyrics about depression and suicide thats not substantial to those people but there are people who have depression anxiety etc who relate to those songs deeply substantial to them people who live a life of drugs and bitches will find that songs about drugs and bitches are substantial
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah bones has really started to stangate like we get it man you use the fucking internet you smoke backwoods and rap we already fucking know say something else
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i mean he only has one concept album the subject matter doesnt differ drastically but my argument is that he raps about a lot of things people would consider substantial
hiphopheads,not_removed,it really doesnt though heres barely related links to prove my point
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol nah thats not how it works i dont relate to volunteers in africa but atleast they are doing something substantial i dont relate to common but his music is important and substantial to hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,and you saying that he can make meaningful music isnt gonna change the fact that hes just another soundcloud rapper albeit a popular one
hiphopheads,not_removed,his music does not vary links of different sounding songs barely related cheap tactic bro youre retarded
hiphopheads,not_removed,jesus fucking christ do you ever not start a post with lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah bro in the context of music substantial is subjective dont make me screenshot the dictionary definition of the word either cuz that would not work in your favor
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is a hill you really want to die on huh lol lol lol ok lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,roasted
hiphopheads,not_removed,the point can be made with or songs whenever someone floods a thread with links its a shitty debate tactic of just overpowering someone with way too many references to make it look like youre right
hiphopheads,not_removed,noooo dont do it you madman anything but the definition lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,it would break you so i will spare your soul tonight
hiphopheads,not_removed,im convinced you cannot convey a message over the internet without expressing how hilarious it is to you
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank you oh merciful one lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,youve said that already my g stop stalking me you weirdo
hiphopheads,not_removed,stalking im looking at my comments to see community interaction — good to see youre consciously omitting lol and lmao from your dumb ass tirades now you fucking idiot
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol stop stalking and dont respond weirdo
hiphopheads,not_removed,im from australia and i think the main problem is that our accent really doesnt suit rap at all thats why we have plenty of good singers because singing hides the accent sure it sounds cool when talking but over a beat it sounds so weird and corny it just doesnt work imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,hilltop hoods were fun back in the day
hiphopheads,not_removed,we got some good producers at least bruh
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont really like australian rap at all but im from perth and recently made a demo ep with my mates and rapped over four original beats my voice doesnt really sound aussie and ive gotten shit for copying the us style before but meh i naturally rap with this accent plus i hate how my voice sounds if i rap with a thick aussie accent heres a link to the demo ep bear in mind i dont really know what the fuck im doing let me know what you think
hiphopheads,not_removed,okay i think the biggest problem is how unaccepting this country and the fans of this genre are to experimentation the only mainstream rappers here are ones with god awful generic pop hooks and poppy beats nothing else gets popular its sad
hiphopheads,not_removed,hilltop hoods
hiphopheads,not_removed,iggy needs to make a comeback
hiphopheads,not_removed,abab rhyme schemes and signature stfu thats not why australian hip hop is bad
hiphopheads,not_removed,im pretty sure koi child is australian and theyre pretty good theyre jazz rap though so i dont know if thats what youre looking for
hiphopheads,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment httpsyoutubecomwatchvikdpbnjhok not really a fan of traditional aussie hiphop but i feel like a lot of the newschool australian rap is just people biting a specific american artist and putting an aus spin on it so many dudes popping up that either sound like joey bad httpsyoutubecomwatchvlxranbqybow you arent looking hard enough manu crook i am d cult shotta im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
hiphopheads,not_removed,what are you talking about some quality aussie hip hop right here
hiphopheads,not_removed,hip hop originates in american ghettoes it comes from struggle and capitalism foreign hip hop is usually garbage because the artists havent struggled like americans do australia is a rich socialist country where racism is socially acceptable and who treats the natives of the land like subhumans unless an abo starts rapping the best you can hope for is someone who poorly goofily emulates american artists ala iggy azalea there is no australian equivalent of atlanta there is no city in australia like oakland hip hop thrives in these cities because there is little else to do and when you have for example oakland which is mostly extreme poverty but then theres south oakland which is mansions you drive minutes and youre in san francisco which is almost all rich people you think man if i work hard enough i could be super rich too it creates a hunger to do better to get out of the bring scary conditions of your neighborhood
hiphopheads,not_removed,become the t pain of australia and just do dope hooks for mainstream artists to gain popularity
hiphopheads,not_removed,i said it below but i feel like it can be overridden if the mc has a personality and has the right beats i dont hear an accent in sampas music for example my problem with her though is her live performances are better than her actual music due to the whacked out mixing even baroremi dont really have an accent theyre just not lively enough to override what accent you can still hear
hiphopheads,not_removed,for boombap and jazzinfused shit yeah outside of that i havent heard any beats from the scene that are lively and have some actual energy
hiphopheads,not_removed,manu crook not a big trap fan but holy shit that pretty much tops it for the best ive heard from this country a flow a decent beat no monotonous accent great find
hiphopheads,not_removed,i feel like it can be overridden if the mc has a personality and has the right beats i dont hear an accent in sampas music for example my problem with her though is her live performances are better than her actual music due to the whacked out mixing even baroremi dont really have an accent theyre just not lively enough to override what accent you can still hear which is just their style
hiphopheads,not_removed,that begs the question is there an audience for an australian rapper that makes the type of music that we all like here with a flow and no grinding accent our sub darlings like the ones i mentioned in the post would america or places like this sub pick up music like that or would it get swept aside is it being swept aside i just wanna hear something that isnt god awful out of my own country as a big kanyekendrickdoomcommonjaylupecudi whatever the fuck fan give me someone that can do it like them that at least isnt american something different ive been wondering this for a while and i conclude that there just must not be a marketfanbase for it
hiphopheads,not_removed,me and my team tough like figaro sick doom reference if i heard right that marcus cut is dope as fuck and b wise isnt bad either great music vid
hiphopheads,not_removed,you make some good points but i mean chances dad worked for obama during his election kanye wasnt necessarily lower class and neither was drake their dreams music and aspirations werent born out of the hood struggle like nas kendrick or big l or something the former two speak on violence in chicago but it hardly defines them artists i think were passed a struggle story and i dont think you need one to say something meaningful kid cudis kanyes dropout lupes food and liquor or simply make great music mbdtf hypothetically if an australian rapped over soulful chancecolekanye beats without a monotone voice or boring flow it cant be that bad im thinking its just not happening because there isnt an audience for it and yeah racism is quite acceptable here its pretty terrible and ive gotten into many fights myself over people being racist but lets not act like racism isnt a problem in america too everything youre saying is right but its not exclusive to just us
hiphopheads,not_removed,you drive minutes and youre in san francisco which is almost all rich people you think man if i work hard enough i could be super rich too it creates a hunger to do better to get out of the bring scary conditions of your neighborhood eh theres some pretty awful neighbourhoods an hour outside of sydney some places you wouldnt want to walk around at night theyre the cheapest places to live and thus are riddled with drug addicts im not rich in the slightest more middlelower but the effect youre talking about is present here too if someone walked into the sydney city after living in mt druitt or some drugged up place like that they might gain the hunger you speak of
hiphopheads,not_removed,i agree with certain points but i think the main problem is as op saidthe australian accent its just hard to pull off rapping in an accent where its hard for people to take seriously no offense to australians but their accent is too goofy for rap edit whoops i meant to mention the user kova instead of op
hiphopheads,not_removed,dopamine trials mphazes i am not even that huge of an aussie hip hop fan but there are a producers that can make literally anything
hiphopheads,not_removed,i just dont think there is unfortunately im just so sick of lazy pop rap songs in the aussie mainstream we could be way more than this i like the way briggs uses his accent its very commanding and brooding that sort of style works way more for us aussies
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is how bad oakland is just for comparison im at my friends apartment his dad owns the entire complex we drive across the street to pick something up because we rarely go to that neighborhood our car is not recognized and we are immediately approached by multiple people claiming they will hook us up with stuff if we go inside their house this is a robbery scam while my friend who has lived across the street from this neighborhood his entire life keeps telling me how sketchy this neighborhood is and how we need to get the fuck out of here living in these neighborhoods make you feel hopeless and trapped of course struggle exists everywhere but it is a very specific different struggle in america because we have the richest people in the world living here while also still having insane poverty also the highest prison population besides china doesnt help
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think its the accent persay but more an underutilisation of vocals theres zero energy or liveliness in any australian hiphop its all monotonous with zero concept of flow hence my use of chance as an example first and foremost because hes got energy hes got a personality go back and listen to chances tape something like nostalgiamissing you where his signature voice is absent i enjoy it but its a great example of what personality and expression can do to vocals because he sounds very rough on the mic and it almost sounds nothing like a chance song because hes not capturing anybodys attention if he stuck with that same voice i doubt hed be kanyes best prodigy and famous as fuck right now and i say that with probably being my favourite chance project
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah yeah you make a great point but i just dont think the struggle if you want to call it that impacts as much on whether the music is good or not it did in the but not so much now i mean drake is top of the game at the moment with no struggle story fake jamaican accents and ghostwriting for fuck sake he isnt dropping gkmcs or tpabs but somehow hes atop of kendrick right now thats the game right now its very very different
hiphopheads,not_removed,alright i just finished listening to nostalgia i get what you mean now his delivery in this song compared to his newer stuff lacks energy personality he would probably be just another average rapper if he didnt change up i changed my mind youre totally right about the underutilisation of vocals
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake is popular because suburban white males are hip hops biggest demographic and they relate to him hes nowhere near as good as kendrick raps about bullshit uses new artists for his own gain ilovemakkonen was better off independant the drake cosign ruined his career steals music hotline bling is a pretty blatant rip off of drams chacha and he has this tendency of being a fake thug im not a drake fan nor is anyone i know who is seriously into hip hop save for one dude whos a suburban white male lol however one thing ive noticed about drake is that he is extremely knowledgeable about even obscure hip hop stuff hes a huge mac dre fan which is weird because mac dre isnt really known very well outside of the bay and once referenced an obscure song click era soulja boy song in a song im not saying struggle is necessary for great music to be made it just makes it more likely take two dudes tell them to write a song put a gun to one of their heads and tell him you wont feed him if the song isnt great put the other one in a nice soho apartment with plenty of food see who writes the better song
hiphopheads,not_removed,fair point its the same thing with every rapper that first album is always going to be the hungriest once theyre pent up in mansions its different kendrick lives in a house outside of la probably why he still sounded hungry on tpab whereas drake in his million dollar mansion hasnt made a great album yet
hiphopheads,not_removed,hahaha for what it is take care isnt so bad i wouldnt call it great but its definitely good kendrick big thing is that he is from compton and still associates with people who still struggle and get killed by gang violence in compton he feels like the only person who can save the city he grew up in which has always had a gang violence problem
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i dont mind a few songs here and there but ill never actually connect with drakes music because it feels impersonal especially now that we know he doesnt write his own shit i know its kendricks whole thing with compton but it also helps that the man is nothing short of a musical genius nobody can put together an album like him from this generation nobody comes close
hiphopheads,not_removed,im from ct and no offense but youre not my favorite from here
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think lonny x probably is the biggest rapper in the state ive never heard of you
hiphopheads,not_removed,anoyd is the best new artist from ct
hiphopheads,not_removed,it just dropped
hiphopheads,not_removed,its been out for a fucking hour what the fuck hahaha
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn chill tf it literally just dropped wait a fucking minute damn let people actually listen to it
hiphopheads,not_removed,pretty great debut i still hold a special place in my heart for cilvia demo so this doesnt necessarily surpass it to me but i think with a little more time it will begin to grow on me some of my favorites were da squaw wats wrong stuck in the mud a lot aa and dressed like rappers
hiphopheads,not_removed,nigga thats why its first impressions
hiphopheads,not_removed,first impressions are later tf
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah it just dropped like literally an hour ago this aint twitter calm down
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn you should definitely listen to better than so is peep the aprocalypse
hiphopheads,not_removed,peep the aprocalypse is a great mixtape joey doesnt cary the tape because everyone from pro era contributes some dope ass verses and kirk and chuck have some great beats too
hiphopheads,not_removed,that was the first one i heard by joey and its great not jonin on any of the other projects im just saying thats my fav and peep is probably my second favorite out of beast coast along with evermore and betteroffdead
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah it is they all put in their fair share might be too much to ask for but i really wish pro era underachievers and flatbush would make a collaboration album kind of reminiscent of peep
hiphopheads,not_removed,stop trying to be eminem
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i usually dont for that reason just was feeling the beat today
hiphopheads,not_removed,you
hiphopheads,not_removed,hmmm is this gonna drop before or after turbo grafx or the songs he has with thugger
hiphopheads,not_removed,big if true
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah alright with frank dropping friday i really dont give a shit about kanyes false promises anymore
hiphopheads,not_removed,if your reading this its heartbreak
hiphopheads,not_removed,a kanye x drake album could potentially change the world
hiphopheads,not_removed,lmao kanye x drake and chainz x drake tapes announced on the same day shits crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,if this is trueoh my good lord apple x tidal baby
hiphopheads,not_removed,kill me right the fuck now bc im not strong enough to handle this
hiphopheads,not_removed,is going to be lit
hiphopheads,not_removed,hes gotta finish his album with chance while hes at it lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,or good ass job
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think the chainz drake thing was a full project just a song off chainzs tape
hiphopheads,not_removed,definitely makes more sense but a new album is still very exciting always puts out quality music consistently
hiphopheads,not_removed,this song is a mother fucking classic got a dark skin friend look like michael jackson got a light skin friend look like michael jackson who doesnt know those bars i remember my dad driving me around and id be switching between hot and power tryna here this song on the radio it also got me to download limewire and start collecting songs i liked yeezy i love you and bruh twista rips this shit apart
hiphopheads,not_removed,she got a light skin friend looks like michael jackson got a dark skin friend looks like michael jackson
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hadnt realized this was a twista song until a couple weeks ago how does everyone feel about the kamikaze version vs the dropout version i love the extended part right before twistas verse and prefer the outro on dropout but i could see myself preferring a shorter version sometimes i have a constantly changing favorite kanye album usually between dropout mbdtf but ive been listening to so much dropout lately and my love for this track has grown so much
hiphopheads,not_removed,idk man i just dont get how anyone can think college dropout isnt kanyes best album
hiphopheads,not_removed,never heard of him
hiphopheads,not_removed,the extended interlude to twist verse gets me so hype everytime
hiphopheads,not_removed,cause mbdtf exists
hiphopheads,not_removed,fr no contest either
hiphopheads,not_removed,because mbdtf yeezus and lr exist
hiphopheads,not_removed,not saying much
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah any real hiphop head knows college dropout destroys mbdtf
hiphopheads,not_removed,what style of song and rapper was white
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah it was a black dude and the style was similar to denzel curry
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats not a
hiphopheads,not_removed,did him dirty went through the reviews for his other tapes real quick and they dont seem to really appreciate them too much either
hiphopheads,not_removed,after more than a dozen releases meek mill is really just a struggle rapper that made it if he started from the bottom now that hes here what else does he have to say wow lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,its pitchfork are you guys really that surprised
hiphopheads,not_removed,surprised they didnt give it a like every other meek project higher than tho i think its unfair to suddenly turn on meek for not evolving on this project this is its unfair to expect it to not be a continuation for a meek mill project this is top tier imo only thing id put in front of it is i want meek to make these street tapes because i feel like if he branched out thatd just mean more pop songs rather than more introspective shit so dude doesnt fuck with meeks antics since dwmtm but at least hes not a drake stan like im sure a lot of writers are review is written fine i just disagree with the sentiment
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is an these critics
hiphopheads,not_removed,its a this is far below what i give it
hiphopheads,not_removed,they haters its at least and and should be in contention with still brazy for aoty
hiphopheads,not_removed,time will tell if meeks legacy outlasts the embarrassing drake episode its amusing how they attempt to align the readers opinions with their own meek will outlast drakes legacy for the simple fact that he writes his raps drakes legacy has been annihilated whether you think he won the battle or not edit you can downvote me but it doesnt change facts drake will be forever a fraud he spent years trying to build up his fake persona views was going to be a hiphop album in the wake of the exposal he had to switch it all out for pop
hiphopheads,not_removed,but the thing is who cares about pitchfork reviews
hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck corny ass pitchfork
hiphopheads,not_removed,i thought this album flowed so nicely between bangers and more down to earth tracks having not listened to any of his other projects i would give it an however based on his more popular tracks it does seem like he sticks to the same subjects on each album so for some it might be getting stale
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wouldnt even give it a
hiphopheads,not_removed,for those unaware every other meek mill project pitchfork has reviewed was given a lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont mind so much that he keeps his flow the same way as ive come to expect that from a meek mill track and so hes is something ill turn to if i need a pump up track or a good album to work out to the problem i have with this album is that he seems to be rapping about wraiths on every track maybe its just that that word in particular stands out
hiphopheads,not_removed,its true though its just the same shit on different beats with a couple decent hooks
hiphopheads,not_removed,absolutely savage but they have a point you can only talk about your rollie and coming up from nothing so many times
hiphopheads,not_removed,theyve been reviewing him since the first dreamchasers and they gave all his project good scores and solid reviews i expect another good review
hiphopheads,not_removed,what does this even mean they are one of the most highly respected music critics
hiphopheads,not_removed,i know they cover like synth pop and experimental jazz
hiphopheads,not_removed,exactly at this point drake had expanded on his sound in three separate installments meek sounds just the same as day to me and that doesnt show longevity
hiphopheads,not_removed,no its like a its nothing new repetative and the same shit meek has been doing since hes one of the least innovative rappers in the game right now nikki has a more progressive sound than meek does right now
hiphopheads,not_removed,i give it an
hiphopheads,not_removed,its over what i gave it
hiphopheads,not_removed,did you read the review
hiphopheads,not_removed,man do you even listen to meeks music this was definitely underwhelming and he didnt even top dwmtm
hiphopheads,not_removed,imo maybe
hiphopheads,not_removed,drakes legacy has been annihilated how many records did drake break with views
hiphopheads,not_removed,all opinions aside you a fool if you believe that
hiphopheads,not_removed,has the legacy of these artists been annihilated nas big l ghostface killah kurupt lil wayne snoop dogg odb the fact that drake didnt write a fifth of his rico verse isnt going to end his career the idea that drake doesnt write any of his music is silly especially considering he writes for others
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think his legacy has been annihilated but i do agree with everything else
hiphopheads,not_removed,in that case drake will be the fraud that broke tons records and was the winner of one of the most notable rap beefs of recent memory
hiphopheads,not_removed,nigga you are out of your mind
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,you dont other people do
hiphopheads,not_removed,if nothing else that demonstrates how fucking ridiculous it is to mark albums on a point scale or like realistically from like it is extremely statistically unlikely that an artist would release five projects of exactly the same quality
hiphopheads,not_removed,
hiphopheads,not_removed,but meek didnt really mention rollie that many times on
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is rap you can do that forever
hiphopheads,not_removed,all that means is that they had a broad horizon and that theyre gonna hold the albums they review to the standard of what good music is in general not just what good hip hop his in relation to hip hop
hiphopheads,not_removed,they cover more than mbdtf and tpab
hiphopheads,not_removed,why bring up drake he said nothing about drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake had expanded on his sound in three separate installments you realize how pretentious that sounds views is all covered ground for drake except for the jamaicaninfluenced stuff which can be traced back to find your love and take care pretty sure had the same complaints for it
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont care for your opinion
hiphopheads,not_removed,when have you ever seen anyone discuss the pitchfork review outside of the score
hiphopheads,not_removed,still better than anything else ive heard editanything released this year by any artist you fanboys
hiphopheads,not_removed,so they were off to your standard
hiphopheads,not_removed,but in the future people wont only remember him for views and iyrtitl it will also be isnt that the dude with ghostwriters
hiphopheads,not_removed,i disagree personally i made the argument when this album dropped about how i didnt like it because it didnt expand or even really improve on meeks sound its just all over again imo and i had a guy try to defend that saying like yeah but i dont always want artists to work on their sound thats why this is great or some shit like that which leads me to believe that more people than me saw this album as just the same shit as the last ones whether that meant it was for better or worse
hiphopheads,not_removed,its not unlikely that an artist releases several releases of the same quality
hiphopheads,not_removed,they are pointing out that you kind of cant sure you can do that and maintain relevance but if youre looking for critical acclaim youre not going to get it from that
hiphopheads,not_removed,word meek isnt anything like drake a better comparison would be someone like big krit big sean rick ross j cole not every artist has to be drake or kanye or kendrick
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was simply drawing a comparison i can say the same about lil wayne tha carter i to iii have very different sounds as you progress through them you can argue that the overall sound of hip hop was changing at the time but still wayne took advantage of it you can say the same about really any artist in the game thats continued to grow ti jeezy chance etc all of these guys had one sounds or style with their first album and then had expanded or refined it by their third or fourth album i dont see that same progression with meek mill
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wasnt including views but thank me later nwts idk how its pretentious to acknowledge the man expanded his sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,and i dont really care if you do
hiphopheads,not_removed,im naive
hiphopheads,not_removed,better than
hiphopheads,not_removed,comparing to his not pitchfork
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah dude eazy e never wrote his own shit and hes an icon i guarantee you that the whole ghostwriting thing may have slightly tarnished like of drakes name but this man will have a legacy that far surpasses meek mill thats a fact drake will be remembered for being the first truly emotionally vulnerable successful rapper meek will be remembered as the gangsta that got bodied by a singin nigga
hiphopheads,not_removed,kanye has ghostwriters too its amazing how dense you are to think drake is the first rapper with writers you try to make it seem like everything drake has put out was written by someone else when really it was maybe or so songs on a throwaway cd that happened to go platinum no one cares about ghostwriters
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think hes looking fro critical acclaim hes not reaching the blogger crowd hes not going for a grammy he knows what he is and does it well
hiphopheads,not_removed,check da edit
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake aint easy e
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont think eazy is considered an icon by himself nwa is but not just e and if you think thats how meek is gonna be remembered your just hating tbh
hiphopheads,not_removed,speak for yourself i give kanye and dre a pass because the are two legendary producers and contributed heavily to the rap game while drake has done nothing but be popular people care about ghostwriters when the person who has them does nothing else but spit someone elses rhymes
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok but this is a blogger site and they are saying that is why they are giving it a low score does meek care probably not does pitchfork yes
hiphopheads,not_removed,true since port of miami hes changed but since deeper than rap hes been doing pretty much the same thing and i fuck with his albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,not saying he is but drake can get there in his own right
hiphopheads,not_removed,nah man eazy e is considered an icon in his own right alongside cube and dre albeit he doesnt have the legacy as pac or biggie but he still gets the respect and honestly what has meek really done to make an impact on hip hop the man has like three or four really major hits the majority of which feature drake im not saying the man gives poor quality music by any means but hes really not any kind of next level artist i just think he gets more credit than he deserves
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol drake also created a sound that people are now mimicking feel how u feel but the numbers show ppl dont care about ghostwriters and as i said the few songs that were ghostwritten dont erase his catalog
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake isnt responsible for all these singing rappers sure tpainye started it but drake revolutionized it
hiphopheads,not_removed,drake doesnt make next level shit either but everybody here thinks hes the second coming of christ
hiphopheads,not_removed,the man has like three or four really major hits the majority of which feature drake depends what you determine as a hit
hiphopheads,not_removed,all i said was speak for yourself a lot of people care about ghostwriters and who is mimicking drake hes one of the biggest culture vultures in the game hes the copycat here lmao
hiphopheads,not_removed,responsible no influenced maybe but hes not responsible for shit ye is responsible for that started and revolutionized that sound
hiphopheads,not_removed,lol what hes not christ but drake by far will be remembered for making his own lane in the hip hop game similarly to kanye this man was really the first successful middle upper class emotionally vulnerable confessional rapper to do what he does you dont have to like his music but his accolades dont lie i dont think theres any rapper aside from jayz that has as broad of a fan base as drake and he did it all without ever once talking about selling drugs or killing people which is the main stereotype of hip hop that in itself is a massive feat
hiphopheads,not_removed,dreams and nightmares rico amen war pains
hiphopheads,not_removed,you just compared drake to jay lmao im done
hiphopheads,not_removed,all eyes on you is his biggest song
hiphopheads,not_removed,i compared fan bases my nigga not their music or quality of content you gonna sit here and act like suburban white moms know who jayz is but not drake
hiphopheads,not_removed,you dumb as fuck smh
hiphopheads,not_removed,oh shit you right that one slipped my mind
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres no arguing w you fam so were just gonna agree to disagree lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,if you say so
hiphopheads,not_removed,wait think i found it fuck all that talk and lets do it i think
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love this little project very dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love ty but this track was much better when it was just travis on the beat
hiphopheads,not_removed,for real why the fuck do the mods keep taking these posts down this should be up top
hiphopheads,not_removed,because his lyrical content on the tracks he has put out shits on about of other rappers out right now
hiphopheads,not_removed,everyone wants what they cant have
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to better in tune with the infinite and abracadabra hes a really special lyricist insanely talented he writes incredible shit also his mysterious status is intriguing and his story of being homeless in new orleans to marrying into one of the worlds wealthiest families is special too
hiphopheads,not_removed,because he makes great fucking music and his lyrics are insane
hiphopheads,not_removed,exhibit c gives him a lifetime pass
hiphopheads,not_removed,yo so michael tolle man totally deserved
hiphopheads,not_removed,is it really the most successful i really dont think it is
hiphopheads,not_removed,its more that forbes recognized em for me but theres an argument there yea
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wouldnt have made that claim but come to think of it i cant think of a more successful indie rap label of this decade maybe strange music actually thats the only one that comes to mind
hiphopheads,not_removed,heres minei update a lot lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats perfect just followed thanks
hiphopheads,not_removed,theres a bunch its not as simple as you want though least wasnt for me try fl studio free version i think studio one has a free version they both have limitations if your serious about it take your time and learn to do it right pays off
hiphopheads,not_removed,fl studio or audacity
hiphopheads,not_removed,fl studio basic tutorials
hiphopheads,not_removed,thanks i just downloaded fl studio it seems pretty confusing but im def going to take my time with it hopefully create something neat
hiphopheads,not_removed,you are a life saver thanks so much
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love the way peep is getting proper video production now on his music videos a sign of progression on his part
hiphopheads,not_removed,what did you guys think about tracys manga
hiphopheads,not_removed,lil tracy is wild
hiphopheads,not_removed,say what you want but this dude is discount uicideboy
hiphopheads,not_removed,underwhelmed by my first listen honestly couple solid new tracks
hiphopheads,not_removed,it was ok all the old tracks already released ended up being my favorites
hiphopheads,not_removed,he sounds nothing like uicideboy
hiphopheads,not_removed,nothing like b my dude completely different sounds nobody sounds like peep
hiphopheads,not_removed,ive literally never heard anybody say that and i cant disagree harder peep is soft guitar beats with layered singing vocals sb is memphis styled sample beats that go hard as fuck with faster rapping usually
hiphopheads,not_removed,yea felt the same way its a tape to put on in the background thats for sure ive always maintained that tracy is better as a feature
hiphopheads,not_removed,bruhh this guy is biting rubys singing so hard i dont even know where to start
hiphopheads,not_removed,thank god
hiphopheads,not_removed,i mean brennan savage sounds almost exactly like him and looks just like him
hiphopheads,not_removed,noodle head
hiphopheads,not_removed,steal yes laptop thats about the only way
hiphopheads,not_removed,and get paid to give it back
hiphopheads,not_removed,fucking dentist aint a doctor
hiphopheads,not_removed,wish he did a part two crazy this tape is three years old now
hiphopheads,not_removed,i was super depressed back when this project came out and used to listen to it all the time now i cant go back to it because it brings me back to those feelings too it was a tight project tho
hiphopheads,not_removed,in that last song he went fucking off
hiphopheads,not_removed,delusional thomas stays in my rotation mac comes with some crazy bars on tracks like larry and melvin but honestly theres not a bad track
hiphopheads,not_removed,for some reason i missed this tape it has so drugish sound from the preview
hiphopheads,not_removed,really wish we got more of this stuff there are some serious bars on here and the production is so grimy
hiphopheads,not_removed,i wish there was a version with his normal voice
hiphopheads,not_removed,in that last song he went fucking off
hiphopheads,not_removed,presses play gunshots kids giggling oh its of these albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,no hummus with that
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant stand that chipmunk voice effect good songs that would be better without that stupid voice
hiphopheads,not_removed,mac
hiphopheads,not_removed,unfortunately
hiphopheads,not_removed,almost always turns out that way unfortunately
hiphopheads,not_removed,man i hate that shit faces reminds me of my ex and its one of my favorite tapes of the last years its so dumb too cause i dont even miss her or anything but listening to that mixtape reminds me of when i did miss her or some shit stupid ass brain fuckin shit up
hiphopheads,not_removed,its some of macs best work imo some really creative albeit dark lyrics its only about minutes long so i suggest that you listen to the whole project
hiphopheads,not_removed,there is check out soundcloud
hiphopheads,not_removed,so nice you had to post it twice
hiphopheads,not_removed,not sure what that means lol

hiphopheads,not_removed,when i said i didnt like the pitch change on blonde people told me i just wasnt used to it and im like but delusional thomas is my favourite mixtape of all time
hiphopheads,not_removed,got the same shit with kauai from gambino but with driving a truck in euro truck simulator always getting pictures of trucks in my head when i listen to anything other than sober from it and it completely ruins the songs
hiphopheads,not_removed,damn i relate to this way too hard
hiphopheads,not_removed,when my grandpa died i listened to cilvia demo for a month straight i regret listening to it that much because i associate it with him and it makes me sad but on the other hand im glad i did because when i listen to it it reminds me of him
hiphopheads,not_removed,wedding always gets me in my feels man
hiphopheads,not_removed,i think he mean like this is going to be a dark trip

hiphopheads,not_removed,the question by mac miller reminds me of minecraft crazy
hiphopheads,not_removed,this is perfect
hiphopheads,not_removed,the unseen is one of my fav albums
hiphopheads,not_removed,started it if im not mistakin would slow down the beats rap over it then speed up the beat till it was just right mans a genius he says he hated rapping just saw lord quas as a challenge and that was his motivation
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love his voice but if you dislike it i cant do much to change that on the songs tell me what i dont know and from the ground he uses a more normal voice seriously though gold dust is an amazing track it and really sucks if you cant enjoy it because of the voice
hiphopheads,not_removed,listen to xxx old and atrocity exhibition all the way through two or three times
hiphopheads,not_removed,i love tell me what i dont know because of that is there any other songs you know of that his voice sounds normal perhaps if i listen to those alot his nasally voice will eventually grow on me
hiphopheads,not_removed,i hope this song isnt on the album
hiphopheads,not_removed,is this different to the earlier the hooch leak edit it wasnt leaked actually released on his
hiphopheads,not_removed,is is literally the same song lol
hiphopheads,not_removed,you still on my dick i see

hiphopheads,not_removed,fuck you
hiphopheads,not_removed,wtf is this place sub everyones talking about
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah but its like ms paint kindergarten quality im surprised grown men want to sit on discord and spend their time doing this but it doesnt hurt anyone or anything so i guess i dont know why im commenting
hiphopheads,not_removed,our sub is getting more and more like a default
hiphopheads,not_removed,try going there rplace
hiphopheads,not_removed,what do you mean
hiphopheads,not_removed,i did and still have no idea whats going on
hiphopheads,not_removed,immature shit a fuck you because the dude doesnt want to paint a pixel every mins i peeped your u and youve been here for a minute tho i apologize
hiphopheads,not_removed,cant see it if youre on mobile
hiphopheads,not_removed,ok so reddit does different shit for april fools every year and this year its rplace so its a canvas and you can place a pixel on it of any color then you wait minutes before you can place another lots of people are organizing different factions for colors and doing organized artwork on it there are little battles and alliances its pretty dope
hiphopheads,not_removed,thats where routoftheloop comes in handy
hiphopheads,not_removed,i dont care about the pixel stuff at all i dont even know how place works honestly it just bothers me when people in this sub come into threads just to call something garbage or in this case just say no if he didnt care about this he shouldve just not commented at all you know idk
hiphopheads,not_removed,its working on my mobile
hiphopheads,not_removed,yeah i guess but nothing anyone says on this website really matters so a fuck you is pretty much the same thing imo
hiphopheads,not_removed,the official reddit app yes none of the others
hiphopheads,not_removed,youre right if im being honest though i didnt think anything of the comment when i made it because i thought the post was going to be removed immediately but i guess not
