india,removed,all of these people were rulers of their states and thats how we know them not because they were soldiers firstly guru gobind wasnt the ruler of any state secondly for the rest they were rulers of their state because they were great warriors and showed great courage do you hear about the administrative skills of leonidas and alexander the great or do you hear about their conquests and battles theres others who didnt become rulers theres hari singh nalwa field marshal montgomery erwin rommel georgy zhukov sun tzu etc etc of course regardless the rules should be same for everyone including the rules of common decency like queuing up it reflects poorly on these soldiers that they pull their uniform and badge on civilians to get ahead in line it would have been far more respectful to queue up like everyone else whats the harm in that i never said anything about rules what happened in ops post was wrong i was reply to the just another fucking job comment i dont know why a discussion of jatt and rajput is relevant here historical and cultural context
india,removed,those people take on those jobs because they have no other options largely due to a lack of education or employment opportunities army officers take those jobs whilst having numerous other options they knowingly accept a profession of high danger if you said to a plumber or construction worker he could take a office job with far higher pay hed do it but like i mentioned rickshawwale who sleep on the roads and work so hard deserve more respect than a typical private sector office worker its not a clear cut issue

india,removed,attention ramblings your way mostly second hand knowledge i heard from friends who are either in services or haveare appearing for upsc so take it with a huge grain of salt now this is the most random exam in the country period anybody who appears in it tells you as much my cousin got shafted twice with pubad and only got a rank when he dropped it it is dice roll it really is how can you have any objectivity in an exam where one candidate appears in public ad another in urdu another in pali a guy i know says for urdu preparation there is only one study material which is page material and people who take urdu are supposedly to be doing well for some reason for the last few years ditto for some other wierd subjects on top of all of that weirdness there is the interviews you have no idea what the interview markings are actually based on as you might get in interviews you think you nailed it and in the ones you think you messed up your interview scores might mean you may or may not get a rank some interview boards are notorious and their biases are well known i heard interviews are simply to push some agenda i wish someone could do an analysis on the upsc data but you see a sudden jump of certain profiles in some years like sudden jump on doctors selection when board decided there wasnt enough diversity sudden jump in performance of women for gender diversity students from a particular state for past few years and so on and so forth i have known iit air and ms from us not getting rank in multiple attempts while some random ba dude getting rank in first attempt this shit is random you keep on giving this exam and suddenly one year you get a rank some people take attempt some take no one can tell you what went wrong the year when he wasnt selected or what went right when he was selected they read the same books same newspapers etc etc and got ranks when they thought they messed up but didnt get ranks when they though they nailed it it high time upsc board stop playing with kids future and bring some transparency in selection process criteria how is marking done and normalized why the scopesyllabus differs so much for different subjects etc etc i have heard of bright students driven to the brink of madnesssuicide because of this exam

india,removed,its not specific to hinduism its the self hatred that is a fad for leftists you can even see it in countries like uk or us where there is an ongoing antiwhite sentiment among the younger generation or retarded anarchists
india,removed,attacking only hinduism allying with and defending conservatives from islam and christianity defending their practices and finally trying to justify it all in the name of lower caste upliftment seems to the be new fad of leftists
india,removed,read about the effect of muslim conquest on hinduism vedas grant women a equal status to man and even in hindi mythology women is given a important status the status of women deteriorated after the muslim conquest as the invaders tend to rape womens the pardhah and goongat system originated during that period same can be said about patriarchy the most patriarch states haryana up punjab faced the most invaders and hence preferred male child which can fight and protect them
india,removed,dude do you even know how organise rss is still instead of chopping people head it choose to help people they are always there in case of natural calamities during the kashmir floods they helped muslim families can u imagine isis taliban doing the same

india,removed,if youre talking about pol yes its a cesspit as most users mention being anonymous makes you say a lot of things like fuck your mom well actually fuck her you make me want to kick her in the nuts
india,removed,i am surprised that this suggestion offended you can you are calling it shit many countries have done similar things in the past
india,removed,why you get enraged when bimaru comes up come on here is a suggestion to solve a long pending issue with a fantastically simple solution i dont buy it migration to cash rich states is okay for you but for states like kashmir you run away at mere mention of name shall i say the name of a feline species 😛😛😛
india,removed,people think you are joking but it is not a bad idea we can take note of how pakistan treated gilgit baltistan since our dear azadi friends are always looking up to pakistan in gb was nonsunni shias and ismailis then in late ziaulhuq got concerned that the shia revolution in iran would spread to gb and hence forcibly settled a bunch of sunnis in the area as a result today the sunni population has grown to from about in a similar tactic of settling bimaru people would not be a bad idea kudos for thinking outside the box
india,removed,who do you think the bro employs in kashmir ive already seen plenty of biharis in jk
india,removed,i dont want to sound dumb but are mirpuris closer to kashmiris or dogras
india,removed,china has done this in tibet and it has worked amazingly well httpsenwikipediaorgwikisinicizationoftibet once we have bimarus in kashmir the muslims majority will also lose its victim status and become an oppressor who hates minorities this will lead to loss of international sympathy for their cause we just need to make sure that bimarus have guns when they arrive in kashmir so they can protect themselves
india,removed,some countries have done similar stuff northern ireland parts of china and pok the good thing is this kind of migration ensures national unity but the cost is domestic violence or disturbance northern ireland and assam which got lots of bengali and bangladeshi immigration are examples of same
india,removed,but we want to avoid comparisons to israel
india,removed,everyone likes the occasional how to solve x thread doesnt mean we dont appreciate your posts bhiliyam keep em coming
india,removed,well dont let the door hit you on the way out
india,removed,the issue is this though there arent many jobs in jk the reason people move out of bimaru states is the lack of opportunity i for one would like infosys jammu to become a thing and have like a few thousand dweeby kids move there every year after a year or two there will be a satellite office close to the nit srinagar campus and from there who knows what will happen
india,removed,please say good bye to your indian citizenship too while youre at it
india,removed,similar discussion
india,removed,its an idea but not a practical one firstly migrants are already working in these places on construction projects of various sorts but they cant settle by owning land because nonstate resident cant own land and this wont change and settling people who are that far down the economic ladder into a service economybecause primary sectors is impractical for them becomes a logistical improbability in real terms also i am seeing a lot of xyz place did it so it must work here as well type of arguments on this thread classic mental trap dynamic esp for indians a model which works elsewhere does not necessarily imply it will work here this sort of relocation works when the area being settled by force is small in its scale in regards to population and network it doesnt work when you are supplanting over which is essentially a another countrywhich the region is in the structure of indian union formation its a collection of countries united together in a union the backlash created is real and violent and long term and you derail the original objective that you started the settlement for to begin with ie bring peace and unity iwt is very tricky its not being touched ever because its a ratified treaty meaning it has binding terms for both parties that is why ratification is knowing as the highest sovereign state tool there exists not even war is above it forced settlement might work in ladakh sector because its sparsely populated and doesnt have on ground integration issues but then again similar fundamental problems arise there cant buy land there and its not really a place which can sustain massive populations its not the swiss alps type of mountains its a very wide mix and conditions are not pleasant for people who have never seen snow in their life in places from where these settlers will be coming from not everyone can even got to visit these places for tourism let alone decide to live there and work
india,removed,iam a bit confused please clarify if iam wrong doesnt jammu kashmir enjoy a special status where indians from other parts cannot buy property there if thats the case then how can bimaru states settle there
india,removed,kejriwal is to modi what pakistan is to india
india,removed,exactly now were here for revenge make kashmir bihar again
india,removed,holy fuck that is the most stupid shit ive read this is exactly the reason kashmiris want independence
india,removed,biharis are not migrating because they dont enough space in bihar they do for jobs what are the opportunities in jammu like
india,removed,typical indian mentality of throwing garbage out of their own home into the homes of others thank goodness we have laws against this
india,removed,all right your suggestion is wrong in so many ways so unless youre a shit poster ill start explaining why this is not going to be possible chenab actually flows through areas like reasi rajouri etc which even though are a part of the jammu region they are very far away from the main city where most of the local population resides so as you suggested that they can get employed by making them build a dam they will never settle there and will move to jammu town in search of a job areas like rajouri and reasi are sparsely populated over a difficult terrain so theyll never be to find job to earn their living theyll never be able to take part in the referendum because it would require them to have a state subject which theyll never have jammu really dislikes bimaru population people of jammu are comparatively well off and the only people who live and beg on the streets are the them so theres that so i dont think youve completely thought this through
india,removed,lol people claiming to be experts should understand that our major adversary is the pakistan army not the civilian govt or the people steps such as sending actors back and canceling the treaty will not affect the military at all in fact it will only embolden their propaganda
india,removed,romantic videos
india,removed,all we really need to do is provide big time incentives for large scale industries to be set up in the state they will bring labor and all that goes with it also the exservice men idea is a good one sending just a few bimarus is just pushing them towards death
india,removed,considering voting in elections has increased significantly over last decades ill say people want this to work our friends are getting scared because of this and trying to rile up as much trouble while they still can now in the face of all of this any overreach by any side spells short term doom and long term irrelevance to the overextended this happened after kargil and were seeing it happen after punch im not saying current strategy on jk is perfect like everything else we have to understand why it developed to be like this and reevaluate it for changing times jk has already realised they have no future with pakistan they realised in and so chose to join us in and chose to go after polls instead of guns we have to remember any troublemakers are direct import from across the border even their friends in valley are scared shitless on overplaying their cards and only do so much at a time
india,removed,akhand
india,removed,he has actually asked modi to unmask pakistans propaganda on international stage and how does he want it to be done by showing proof he thinks aam junta is naive enough to believe in his good intentions while he traps and baits modi and fell into his trap
india,removed,haha jats and yadav they will get us half of pakistan which we definitely dont want
india,removed,if you cannot retaliate in racism against the whites you dont deserve to be on
india,removed,no you have not your cohesive thought out strategy has been to use as much brutal force as is required to silence the people which i must admit has been executed with great diligence and levelheadedness
india,removed,if you move to jammu i will donate few dollars for your move either do it yourself or stop suggesting irrational ideas for others and being condescending towards people calling them bimaru workers
india,removed,bimarus are a vile lot who think chanakya was born from bihar those with vested interests can easily make bimarus do bad things migration to punjab etc happened after local terror issues were well settled there otherwise bimarus wouldve easily played into separatists hands current bimaru migration is purely on basis of low class labor a maharashtra style resurgence against bimarus from other states will make things very bad even if few a group of bimarus go bad

india,removed,and dont forget the lakh cctv for women safety
india,removed,nothing to see here folks carry on the tone is pretty clear there are too many other red flags combined with this amazing reversal of fortunes which makes me skeptical the red flags which you are yet to mention
india,removed,lol at the scroll article these politicians were talking about their own constituencies and region not whole india and they were correct it can be seen that by three districts muzaffarnagar moradabad and rampur are certain to be muslim majority by in fact rampur is already muslim majority two more bijnor and saharanpur are either going to be muslim majority or else will be very close to muslim majority only two districts bareilly and meerut are likely to be hindu majority in and have been shown so by all models it is worthwhile remembering that both districts were more than per cent hindu in so the reality based on current models is that these districts will be muslim majority by not assam and bengal do have drastic changes in their demographics the author chooses to use data lets use data which i believe being current can be trusted more the most rapid rise in the share of muslims in the total population was witnessed in assam nationally percentage of muslims in total population went up from in to in assam recorded highest increase in share of muslims from of the states population to it is still higher than the national average of for the decade in three districts of bengal murshidabad malda and north dinajpur the muslim population has surpassed the hindu population the famous malda moreover if in india the hindu population has dipped by per cent in bengal it is much higher at per cent correspondingly if the muslim population has increased by per cent in bengal the growth has a higher rate per cent in bengals crore population hindus still comprise crore people or per cent of the population muslims comprise crore population or per cent compared to the census data this is slightly higher for a decade earlier the hindu population in bengal was crore and muslim population was crore bengals population then too was far lesser at crore the only thing constant then and now is the asymmetrical spread of bengals population by religion history says in murshidabad the national tricolor was unfurled two days after august for they had all but taken it that they would cede to east pakistan shows their thinking the author claims that the population of muslims would stabilize between based on data where as they are already at in so will their now decline even after having a high tfr or what this begs questions from the author the editor and the publication why did it use data while writing an article in when data was available did the bjp govt in fudge the data to show less or did upa fudge it in or are both data true and his analysis wrong why didnt scrollin fact check when toi or indianexpress could what is the reason for higher than national average growth of muslim population present in only two states of india bordering bangladesh
india,removed,he asked for data to show the population is declining ylu showed him articles which claim that hindu population was in in should have read your articles
india,removed,imams fatwa is an opinion sakshi maharajs opinion at a private function is disruptive and communal thats how it works in this country

india,removed,feminist say that women are free to wear whatever they want i would say that too but the reality is that untill we change the mindse t of boys women should actually take care of themselves now regarding self defense its very good to promote self defense among women but remember a women is no jackie chan to fight a gang of molesters herself neither is she a cyborg to pepper spray the molesters instantly taking out spray takes some time and women are physically a little weaker then men thats how god made us so expecting women to defend themselves may work in some cases and not in others what feminist argue is that in these times women should wear all those clothes and go out late at night and expect nothing to happen what they should say is that women should keep those clothes at bay for sometime till the situation improves and then they could wear them as much as they want
india,removed,out of curiosity whats ur religion lets keep that a secret check inbox
india,removed,they dont expect nothing to happen they want nothing to happen do you not understand the difference well thats a smart bunch of feminist youve met the ones ive met are like brat girls who wanted to break stereotypes shatter the glass ceiling and do away with the norms thats what i tell them dont expect nothing to happen what clothes was the victim in this video wearing she was covered head to toe should she have been in a burqa and if women start dressing in burqas years from now there will be some great magical transformation so that suddenly no woman will get molested anywhere anytime if you agree i have some wonderful destinations in the middle east i can offer you never said that its always due to clothes but sometimes it is and care should be taken until the mindsets are changed what feminists really argue is that women should be able to live their lives without constant fear of getting molested so do i but it will take some massive effort by all of us
india,removed,befaltu ka thread
india,removed,do you use saar just to look cool
india,removed,nothing much but this alone isnt the only molestation case thousands of other cases are as well youll have to look at them and then judge for yourself btw pay attention to but sometimes it is its clear what i wanted to state
india,removed,youre looping around expressing expectation is fine im just saying itll take time to change mindset and until that happens try to be safe even then incidents could happen but try to be extra cautious didnt say that the womens fault but until things change you cant expect it to not go wrong all im saying is its better to be cautious till things change ofcourse still incidents do happen but all the girl could do on her side is to take all safety measures

india,removed,now youre repeating the same thing which you did a few comments back and you expect me to do the same i think it wont be justified to talk to a person who has not enough wits to understand a simple point maybe some other day you should look at the thread again and understand the point around which you kept on looping

india,removed,from my american family he seems to be in the lead with most states being red now also his economic policy plan looks to be much much better for america in the overall run compared to hillarys fiscal monetary policy comparisions have a look yourself and please explain how donald is a slow cancer or are you just poor low class loser who cant make something of themselves donald j trumps vision reduce taxes acrosstheboard especially for working and middleincome americans who will receive a massive tax reduction ensure the rich will pay their fair share but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability to compete eliminate special interest loopholes make our business tax rate more competitive to keep jobs in america create new opportunities and revitalize our economy reduce the cost of childcare by allowing families to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes including stayathome parents read the fact sheet on donald j trumps tax policy here read mr trumps remarks at the detroit economic club and the new york economic club tax law changes the trump plan will revise and update both the individual and corporate tax codes individual income tax tax rates the trump plan will collapse the current seven tax brackets to three brackets the rates and breakpoints are as shown below lowincome americans will have an effective income tax rate of the tax brackets are similar to those in the house gop tax blueprint brackets rates for marriedjoint filers less than more than but less than more than brackets for single filers are ½ of these amounts the trump plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure maximum rate of percent with tax brackets shown above carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income the percent obamacare tax on investment income will be repealed as will the alternative minimum tax deductions the trump plan will increase the standard deduction for joint filers to from and the standard deduction for single filers will be the personal exemptions will be eliminated as will the headofhousehold filing status in addition the trump plan will cap itemized deductions at for marriedjoint filers or for single filers death tax the trump plan will repeal the death tax but capital gains held until death and valued over million will be subject to tax to exempt small businesses and family farms to prevent abuse contributions of appreciated assets into a private charity established by the decedent or the decedents relatives will be disallowed childcare americans will be able to take an abovetheline deduction for children under age that will be capped at state average for age of child and for eldercare for a dependent the exclusion will not be available to taxpayers with total income over marriedjoint single and because of the cap on the size of the benefit working and middle class families will see the largest percentage reduction in their taxable income the childcare exclusion would be provided to families who use stayathome parents or grandparents as well as those who use paid caregivers and would be limited to children per taxpayer the eldercare exclusion would be capped at per year the cap would increase each year at the rate of inflation the trump plan would offer spending rebates for childcare expenses to certain lowincome taxpayers through the earned income tax credit eitc the rebate would be equal to percent of remaining eligible childcare expenses subject to a cap of half of the payroll taxes paid by the taxpayer based on the lowerearning parent in a twoearner household this rebate would be available to married joint filers earning for single taxpayers or less limitations on costs eligible for exclusion and the number of beneficiaries would be the same as for the basic exclusion the ceiling would increase with inflation each year all taxpayers would be able to establish dependent care savings accounts dcsas for the benefit of specific individuals including unborn children total annual contributions to a dcsa are limited to per year from all sources which include the account owner parent in the case of a minor or the person establishing elder care account immediate family members of the account owner and the employer of the account owner when established for children the funds remaining in the account when the child reaches can be used for education expenses but additional contributions could not be made to encourage lowerincome families to establish dcsas for their children the government will provide a percent match on parental contributions of up to per year for these households when parents fill out their taxes they can check a box to directly deposit any portion of their eitc into their dependent care savings account all deposits and earnings thereon will be free from taxation and unused balances can rollover from year to year business tax the trump plan will lower the business tax rate from percent to percent and eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax this rate is available to all businesses both small and large that want to retain the profits within the business it will provide a deemed repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a onetime tax rate of percent it eliminates most corporate tax expenditures except for the research and development credit firms engaged in manufacturing in the us may elect to expense capital investment and lose the deductibility of corporate interest expense an election once made can only be revoked within the first years of election if revoked returns for prior years would need to be amended to show revised status after years election is irrevocable the annual cap for the business tax credit for onsite childcare authorized by sec of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of would be increased to per year up from and recapture period would be reduced to years down from years businesses that pay a portion of an employees childcare expenses can exclude those contributions from income employees who are recipients of direct employer subsidies would not be able to exclude those costs from the individual income tax and the costs of direct subsidies to employees could not be used as a cost eligible for the credit contrast with hillary clinton the trump plan protects all lowincome and middleincome americans and lowers their taxes as the tax foundation put it donald trumps plan is a tax cut for all income groups while hillary clintons plan is a tax increase on selected income groups the tax foundation determined that on average taxpayers will receive a tax cut of under the trump plan but a tax increase of under the clinton plan donald j trumps tax plan will increase the economy and grow jobs by almost million while hillary clintons tax plan will shrink the economy and lose jobs in combination with the total economic reform agenda the trump economic plan will create at least million jobs over

india,removed,if someone from another country took a look at our sub for a month then heshe would think that we live in a war torn country
india,removed,ive noticed this too of course we should not just ignore the negative happenings around us but that doesnt mean we should actively seek it imo this subreddit is doing exactly that many users here spend their entire time here starting fights and cribbing about everything this panicky alarmist attitude is literally the worst kind of attitude to have its not good for the mind or body its why im gonna actively try this year to spread positivity in here i hope you join me op and anyone else whos reading this
india,removed,most people on the internet are sad
india,removed,what does this have to do with demonetization this post has nothing to do with it and would be valid even without demonetization your dad wouldnt stop supporting if there was no demonetization also this has nothing to do with modi and people in this thread are somehow referencing him the antibakths are just as annoying as the bakths
india,removed,indians are like this only always complaining and crying ugh s
india,removed,it would take serious callousness for someone to be aware of the shit thats going around in the polity and still be happy most people here are cynics and thats how most progressive people across history have been it takes a cynic to cut through jingoistic chestthumping and see the reality as it is if we are like that i say well done
india,removed,politics we are more into politics than most people did you have look at the rall during the us elections looked like they are going to cut open their country anytime and we give more importance to politics than most so its obviously split wide open
india,removed,wodden
india,removed,you are contradicting yourself here here is a product that has a solid marketing strategy and unless it gets officially called out for fraud via some consumer case i am inclined to believe that it is legit just like the marketing and lies foreign fmcgs spread but which you seem to assume is totally and absolutely true and has expanded by leaps and bounds people clearly are picking stuff they think is good yet here you are shitting on it just because you dont like it these products are offered at steep discounts compared to other similar products the distribution network has expanded within years and they still spend way less on marketing than other fmcg companies so what i your beef here this is like some apple hater saying why are all these filthy plebians buying samsung
india,removed,because modi is pm
india,removed,another thing i have noticed is that people share news based on just reading the title they themselves dont bother to actually read whats written in the article and check if its a clickbait article where title doesnt matches the content they share this article because it resonates with their echochambers a couple of times when i asked them why have they shared it when the content and the subject are incoherent they said its not their fault as they have not written the article and so how can they be blamed for it in the past month every tom dick harry is writing articles on the current state of affairs the way reddit works is that any link is considered as a source which is kind of ridiculous since it empowers the popular opinion and furthur spread negativity
india,removed,i thought about the same thing today rindia is filled with complaints
india,removed,internet in general is not very happy
india,removed,no man i am tall wrt indian standards the guy with me was as well but i think it was because that guys friend knew what he was doing is scummy so when someone responded they realised that it was not going to end well also it was near mg road there were police like from there
india,removed,and then rant on rindia how india is a sith hole and their parents are molly coddling them

india,removed,dont think for a moment its any different in hardcore hindu settings is it really though brahmins tend to be very pious from my experience same with buddhism and sikhism rarely hear of sexual assaults by their priests it happens for sure but i feel that it isnt out of place with the general population whilst with islam and christianity it seems rife see ireland i mean the fake saints and babas most definitely but those are more like cults rather than hinduism and they should be fucking assassinated

india,removed,now they will blame it on delhiites instead of fixing their own pathetic police fuck the south of india
india,removed,im sorry but burqas have no place in any country especially india
india,removed,
india,removed,im not going to take anything you say seriously because most your comments on this subreddit are antikejriwal its obvious who owns you the duty of cleaning up delhi solely rests on the mcd not on any mla dont believe me go read up the duties of municipal corporations and the duties of mlas its stupid to say that a supreme court judge doesnt know this which only leads to the other conclusion of course such reasoning is beyond you buddy your overlords wont let you think that hard
india,removed,yes because indians are asking for a free room

india,removed,i have decided to clean the filth like you in internet so i have to step in to the shit it is my responsibility to educate the ignorant pseudoliberals ans meateaters
india,removed,right so its tots cool when he indirectly calls me an aap cultist right
india,removed,ummm ill have to look through my inbox sec
india,removed,here ya go
india,removed,sure nothing wrong with him calling me an aap cultist
india,removed,oh so im allowed to imply that hes a shill if i dont say it out loud thats cool then thanks for the advice its not exactly easy to figure out rules like these
india,removed,also i resent the accusation that im among kejriwals core support base
india,removed,calling the core support base of kejriwal anything isnt an accusation of any point given how youve already said you dont think you are a part of it hes pretty much implying that im a part of it to invalidate my points thats somehow okay
india,removed,ill show you another comment where he outright says it if youre actually being unbiased about this id like to complain about this guy he flings shit at any guy he suspects to be an aap supporter and goes for ad homenim right from the start go through his comments on this subreddit and youll see him do that very often the problem is that he often does it indirectly like he did in the first comment of his that i quoted i dont see how it isnt obvious to you sure i got pissed off but any normal person would get pissed off if he got accused of supporting a side in a discussion because hes biased i wouldnt have accused him of bias if he hadnt multiple times in the past directly and indirectly accused me of bias
india,removed,at risk of sounding like a whiny year old do i have to this shit concerns me to an extent but i honestly cant bring myself to invest much time into it i know im asking a lot from you but couldnt you look into it suo moto im also worried that it might entirely be caused by miscommunication between me and swacchreddit and if thats actually the case id have to deal with a lot more embarrassment if i actually lodged a formal complaint in modmail even right now i feel like making a new account because im worried that i could be wrong about the guy and im just setting myself up for embarrassment by complaining to you

india,removed,explain this to me again rindia you were all out with pitchforks for some dudes who threw a puppy off a roof but today i see only silence and some pitiful tries to prove this lady as a fanatic so you care about animals but only the ones which look cute to you or are you are afraid to talk against cow killings lest you be painted as a sanghi among your liberal beef eating american friends abroad which one is it
india,removed,i said it might be i dont know what i know is that this guy has shouted slogans like bharat tere tukde honge inshallah inshallah strange an atheist using inshallah he is a kashmiri and supports kashmiri separatism and terrorism this is a political issue and he is using the religious identity as well so its either a political opportunism or he is lying about him being an athiest i didnt mean to insult any practising muslim i have full respect and malice but not for this guy whether he is an athiest a believer or a pretender

india,removed,friend just posted this yesterday i was at pampore hospital along with my friends trying to assist the paramedics there around half a dozen ambulances arrived with severely injured mostly from kulgam in the afternoon doctors were trying to save a man with bullet injury in his hip he was inside the ambulance which had been attacked by government forces on the way its glass panes had been smashed and attendants inside it were also beaten up suddenly we heard intense gun shots nearby while we were trying to figure out what was going on two gypsies of government forces barged into the hospital premises and started abusing people and swinging batons on them we ran inside terrified the government forces dragged a youth from inside the ambulance and beat him in front of everyone he was bundled into the gypsy and taken away they disturbed and delayed the treatment of critically injured man in the ambulance bmo pampore and senior doctors were aghast and they went with a complaint to the sho terrified women cried and raised profreedom slogans this is limit of zulum said a terrified doctor if this is what they want to do we are going to shut this hospital said another doctor later tehsildar arrived and he was apprised about what had happened till evening over a dozen injured were treated at the hospital some with pellet injuries the injured man in the ambulance was identified as azad from shopian district he was carried on arms by a paramedic and shifted to another ambulance but he succumbed to his injuries while he was breathing his last he had a faint smile on his face my friend who was inside the ambulance near him told me he was reciting verses as he lay on the bench salute to the ambulance drivers who braved threats on way but carried injured people salute to paramedics and doctors who worked diligently and tended every patient with professionalism and humanity shame on those who attacked ambulances and injured people and harassed civilians and doctors

india,removed,india needs to punish to pakistan though its now or never maybe not a conventional war escalation because nuclear deterrence is so lopsided india is conventionally far more superior than pakistan but both countries have nukes this situation is highly favourable to pakistan as they can keep needling india with cross border terrorism but india cant escalate as such because their army is filled with irrational idiots and a stupid nuclear doctrine for starters india should unilaterally declare the indus valley treaty null void let the pakis squirm without resources we should simultaneously launch a full frontal diplomatic isolation and put pakistan into corner so that they can be the aggressors and they will be forced to do a conventional attack india can easily respond with a fatal blow and finish this once and for all ps fwiw our army is seriously underprepared how the hell terrorists are able to sneak through regularly across such a tightly guarded loc and breach an army base looks like a serious lapse in our entire system

india,removed,i do not live in india and as such i feel the exact same as op before years all the mood about india was completely negative nobody talked about india as any emerging power in any sense of the word in the next years it was like ethopia and i am sure ethopia is better what i did realize is that indians have this amazing sense of pride in their country when modi first got elected the liberal inside me was upset when i heard news of beef ban talks of banning porn and other things going in the conservative direction but slowly i just saw how much work this guy was putting in to try to change things he does not leave a single opportunity to talk to people outside of india and in india with the demonetization the fact that it was the most unplanned action in history affirms my belief in him doing things with good intentions he really did not want things to leak when i leave india and see the drastic difference that is visible only after many years of living away from the country i realize that india needs something drastic to ever not be a world country in the general sense of a world country then people look at china and realize that the countries that escape world need a strong minded leadership that took drastic steps i feel like the first time in a long time atleast something is happening people compare gdp and dont realize that the standard of living hasnt been improving for the people of india in the longest time any change is good change india is at rock bottom

india,removed,are they shouting crap at some other leader are they disrupting a sporting event like i said its one thing if these monkeys were disrupting a speech but to hoot like idiots at him when he was only watching the match keep trying to shift the goal posts its amusing
india,removed,or maybe she came with an open mind and just didnt like you i am going to tell you things you might not like but your behaviour wasnt exactly that would make ladies swoon the first thing you say when you meet someone is that you need to smoke i think you were nervous as hell i think you were nervuos and didnt go with an open mind already prejudiced having read her blog and her being into feminism second red flag is you essentially told her to shut up in the car trying to ration her conversations in the fear that she might run of conversation lets face it you were afraid you wouldnt have anything to talk about thats not how conversations work man you dont stop people from talking becuase they might run out of conversations third the order what if she thought she will start with a drink and maybe order the food later and you ordered good for yourself wihtout asking her this whole thing looks like a train wreck from the getgo and there seems to be a lot of miscommubication the fact that you felt relieved when she bailed out confirms that you were nervous as hell and just wanted this while thing to get over with as soon as possible and subconsciously trying to sabotage the whole thing from the getgo having said all of this the girl was a douchebag too and rude as hell just becuase a date doesnt go your way means you can say eff off to the guy have some fucking courtsey for a guy who paid for your drink man i shat on you becuase i think you will need to loose the butterflies and be more open minded if you want to score successful dates
india,removed,not that police is not corrupt and accountable in any part of the country how do we know the case mentioned is true is there a background to this story
india,removed,that sounded more about bjp and lesser about aap just like kejriwal
india,removed,defend their history and culture they become self appointed custodians when all the voices which represent them are lost in oblivion or are already politicized the only way left for them is restoring to such tactics coz when they resorted to peaceful means during jodha akbar they were still called fringe let them have a voice and they wont resort to succ methods
india,removed,of course he didnt mean it literally considering on radio posters tv newspapers pamphlets metro stations hoardings he is pretty much everywhere
india,removed,what freedom of speech man the media is already against them no matter what they do how are they going to advocate their freedom of speech are you even aware of what their opinion is are you even aware what they said during jodha akbar no because no one covers their point of view they do not have a freedom of expression those artists and journalists who do cover their point of view are already sold as per this very sub like sardana like vivek agnihotri so spare me with foe bullshit
india,removed,yeah when the free media ought to behave impartially giving too much weightage to ones foe and ridiculing the others would resort to desperate measures
india,removed,fine lets have a level headed talk then have you seen mohenjo daro
india,removed,
india,removed,buddha in a traffic jam was a fairly good movie it exposes how poor villagers are never allowed to grow by the very maoists who claim to protect them my point however is the director got a good beating when he visited jnu and jadhavpur university by the students and their political leaders were you aware about it did media cover it inspite of some riveting performances by pallavi joshi and arunoday singh the movie was heavily panned by critics the movie received no recognition or award its shows were even disrupted in some areas did bollywood condemn it did media condemn it so the problem is the directors foe was heavily curtailed but no one gave a damn one attack on bhansali and people say the country is gone to dogs because and bollywood is rallying behind him in his support see my point is the media in our country is highly impartial and there is absolutely no chance for groups like this fringe mob or the director of buddha in a traffic jam to express their foe and thats what leads to the desperate measures
india,removed,bro we will soon be because people are being pushed against the wall these courts judge the difference between sandal and chappal an exias officer whose daughter was raped and murdered claimed when the rapist who was serving jail escaped when out on parole please the courts should not push people so much that they start taking law into their own hands that said i myself condone the violence i just want to say give them a level playing field chances are they wont resort to violence

india,removed,committing suicide is easier here
india,removed,i wish to agree with all your points but i am not so optimistic about the seemingly cavalier attitude modi should have regarding his chances in as you said bjp should bank on the suburban votes and given that of people are probably watching hindi news channels apart from zee news and indiatv and maybe no other channels are even remotely interested in looking at the government with unbiased eyes aajtak is hell bent on talking about intolerance along with the others i could see punya prasoon vajapayee and rahul kanwal visibly frothing to take down amit shah at the it conclave so fucking annoying half the urban people on this subreddit are more concerned about how being probjp is being a saffron bhakt rss chutiya than actual problems that arise from appeasing minorities in places where they arent even fucking minorities i hope what you say is true but its an uncomfortable throne and modi would be wise to ensure that his vision for india is not compromised by poor media management

india,removed,modi will never be given the credit all aap and congress bhakts are nowhere to be seen today
india,removed,sanjay gandhi like most people on this site was a moron the question to ask is why did people have so many children the answer is quite simple really since you too are a moron ill give it to you if you are less moronic than i think you are you will verify independently till the early the child mortality rate in india was phenomenally high over per thousand this had regional variations too in up for example it was over this led to in accordance with the bell curve some people having five or six kids and none of them surviving to adulthood the life expectancy for adults too was not particularly high even if children survived to adulthood it was not certain that they would live to have children themselves and there was no social safety net children were your old age support additionally in a feudal society like india there is always someone lusting after your land and the state is useless in protecting you in this case having lots of children is a way of preventing domination subjugation and pain ergo people had lots of kids this was the same throughout india including the south most of the mallu and tamil families i grew up with had at least children as infant mortality has decreased and the state has become more responsive the tfr has decreased in the south child mortality has decreased to a greater extent and the state has a greater presence so the tfr is lower now fuck off and triple check everything i said
india,removed,i did say you were a moron right the reason he was wrong was that he was trying to apply an incorrect solution forcibly to a problem had he been allowed to continue it would have led to rebellion upheaval and chaos which would have exacerbated the conditions which were responsible for the problem in the first place now go sit in a corner and try to learn to think for yourself

india,removed,what supreme court said on national anthem respect and tolerance yrs ago people stand as jana gana mana is played at a theatre in goregaon mumbai on republic day in express photo vasant prabhu people stand as jana gana mana is played at a theatre in goregaon mumbai on republic day in express photo vasant prabhu on monday the supreme court said all cinema halls across the country should play the national anthem and that those present must stand up in respect to instill a feeling within one a sense of committed patriotism and nationalism the order has touched off an old debate on whether forcing someone to sing the anthem infringes on certain fundamental rights in august a supreme court bench of justices o chinnappa reddy and m m dutt had in bijoe emmanuel ors vs state of kerala ors granted protection to three children of the jehovahs witness sect who didnt join in the singing of the national anthem at their school the court held that forcing the children to sing the anthem violated their fundamental right to religion excerpts from the judgment authored by justice reddy on the children and prayer the three childappellants bijoe binu mol and bindu emmanuel are the faithful of jehovahs witnesses they attend school daily during the morning assembly when the national anthem jana gana mana is sung they stand respectfully but they do not sing they do not sing because according to them it is against the tenets of their religious faith — not the words or the thoughts of the anthem but the singing of it the children were left in peace and to their beliefs that was until july when some patriotic gentleman took notice the gentleman an mla thought it was unpatriotic of the children not to sing the national anthem so he put a question in the assembly a commission was appointed the commission reported that the children are law abiding and that they showed no disrespect to the national anthem but under the instructions of deputy inspector of schools the head mistress expelled the children from the school from july finally the children filed a writ petition in the high court seeking an order restraining the authorities from preventing them from attending school first a learned single judge and then a division bench rejected the prayer of the children on the high court ruling we are afraid the high court misdirected itself they considered in minute detail each and every word of the national anthem and concluded that there was no word or thought which could offend anyones religious susceptibilities but that is not the question at all the objection of the petitioners is not to the language or the sentiments of the national anthem they do not sing the national anthem wherever jana gana mana in india god save the queen in britain the starspangled banner in the united states and so on on articles and now we have to examine whether the ban imposed by the kerala education authorities against silence when the national anthem is sung on pain of expulsion from the school is consistent with the rights guaranteed by arts and of the constitution we may at once say that there is no provisions of law which obliges anyone to sing the national anthem nor do we think that it is disrespectful to the national anthem if a person who stands up respectfully when the national anthem is sung does not join the singing it is true art of the constitution enjoins a duty on every citizen of india to abide by the constitution and respect its ideals and institutions the national flag and the national anthem proper respect is shown to the national anthem by standing up when the national anthem is sung it will not be right to say that disrespect is shown by not joining in the singing standing up respectfully when the national anthem is sung but not singing oneself clearly does not either prevent the singing of the national anthem or cause disturbance to an assembly engaged in such singing so as to constitute the offence mentioned in s of the prevention of insults to national honour act on article of constitution article is an article of faith in the constitution incorporated in recognition of the principle that the real test of a true democracy is the ability of even an insignificant minority to find its identity under the countrys constitution this has to be borne in mind in interpreting art on west virginia state board of education v barnette verdict government of limited power need not be anaemic government assurance that rights are secure tends to diminish fear and jealousy of strong government and by making us feel safe to live under it makes for its better support if there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation it is that no official high or petty can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics nationalism religion or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein if there are any circumstances which permit an exception they do not now occur to us on the question of tolerance we are satisfied in the present case that the expulsion of the three children from the school for the reason that because of their conscientiously held religious faith they do not join the singing of the national anthem in the morning assembly though they do stand up respectfully when the anthem is sung is a violation of their fundamental right to freedom of conscience and freely to profess practise and propagate religion we therefore find that the fundamental rights of the appellants under art and have been infringed and they are entitled to be protected we allow the appeal set aside the judgment of the high court and direct the respondent authorities to readmit the children into the school we only wish to add our tradition teaches tolerance our philosophy preaches tolerance our constitution practises tolerance let us not dilute it version function i post the articles text as a comment if the website is adblocker unfriendly powered by

india,removed,
india,removed,the main point of contention was that dassault was to be held liable for the fuck ups of hal manufactured rafale regardless of qa from the frenchs perspective it would have a short end of a deal to be held responsible for that as they had very low confidence on the capability of hal in absorbing the technologies and rightly so to say that goi did not consider all options would be ludicrous as defence deals are kept in close wraps and it would be impossible to find the minute aspects of terms of negotiations you and i can only speculate on that matter

india,removed,your question why did you strike out christian nations why is christianity not relevant your thats my point we are in agreement the western nations arent more liberal because they are christian majority

india,removed,i think the only way india lets go of kashmir is by building a dam on indus and diverting the water to the indian territories it isnt about religion or patriotism or anything else it is about fresh water which india is deficient in

india,removed,why should we give away the kashmir valley its an integral part of india
india,removed,we already have jammu and were not going to give away an inch of our sovereign country to pakis
india,removed,i dont know even though i have nothing against islam or for that matter any other religion i am posting a rather long passage i read it somewhere which tells what happens when islam comes into a country and the effects of it s growthhere goes as long as the muslim population remains around or under in any given country they will be for the most part be regarded as a peaceloving minority and not as a threat to other citizens this is the case in united states—muslim australia—muslim italy—muslim china—muslim norway—muslim canada—muslim at to they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups often with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs this is happening in denmark—muslim united kingdom—muslim germany—muslim spain—muslim thailand—muslim from on they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population for example they will push for the introduction of halal clean by islamic standards food thereby securing food preparation jobs for muslims they will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature halal on their shelves—along with threats for failure to comply this is occurring in switzerland—muslim philippines— sweden—muslim the netherlands—muslim trinidad tobago—muslim france—muslim at this point they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves within their ghettos under sharia the islamic law the ultimate goal of islamists is to establish sharia law over the entire world when muslims approach of the population they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions in paris we are already seeing carburnings any nonmuslim action offends islam and results in uprisings and threats such as in amsterdam with opposition to mohammed cartoons and films about islam such tensions are seen daily particularly in muslim sections in guyana—muslim kenya—muslim india—muslim russia—muslim israel—muslim after reaching nations can expect hairtrigger rioting jihad militia formations sporadic killings and the burnings of christian churches and jewish synagogues such as in ethiopia—muslim at nations experience widespread massacres chronic terror attacks and ongoing militia warfare such as in bosnia—muslim chad—muslim lebanon—muslim from nations experience unfettered persecution of nonbelievers of all other religions including nonconforming muslims sporadic ethnic cleansing genocide use of sharia law as a weapon and jizya the tax placed on infidels such as in malaysia—muslim albania—muslim sudan—muslim qatar—muslim after expect daily intimidation and violent jihad some staterun ethnic cleansing and even some genocide as these nations drive out the infidels and move toward muslim such as has been experienced and in some ways is ongoing in bangladesh—muslim indonesia—muslim syria—muslim tajikistan—muslim egypt—muslim jordan—muslim united arab emirates—muslim pakistan—muslim iraq—muslim iran—muslim gaza—muslim morocco—muslim palestine—muslim turkey—muslim will usher in the peace of daressalaam—the islamic house of peace here theres supposed to be peace because everybody is a muslim the madrassas are the only schools and the koran is the only word such as in afghanistan—muslim saudi arabia—muslim somalia—muslim yemen—muslim unfortunately peace is never achieved as in these states the most radical muslims intimidate and spew hatred and satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical muslims for a variety of reasons
india,removed,independence is a sham you really believe an independent country that is muslim majority can exist sandwiched between india and pakistan pakistan would invade within hours if kashmir achieves independence just like what happened in is your history that weak
india,removed,sunnis hate the shias of kargil and baltistan what noooo
india,removed,keep drinking your independence kool aid
india,removed,why is this comment all the way down here if it is stickied isnt it supposed to be on top
india,removed,tamils dont violently demand for a separate country and definitely dont kill indian armymen and police they are sane and contribute to their motherland kashmiris should do the same learn something from the tamils
india,removed,what rise of radicalism in chechnya i need a source there hasnt been any major terrorist attack in chechnya in nearly a decade its completely integrated into russia now
india,removed,thats sri lanka im talking about india and there too prabhakaran was defeated and ltte demolished terrorism is not a solution kashmiris should learn that
india,removed,first of all whats all this your country your army kashmir is in india and kashmiris are indian india is your country too and indian army is your army too stop this poisonous us vs them narrative we indians consider you kashmiris as our fellow citizens it would be great if you would reciprocate the gesture and btw all you can engage is in whataboutism you got no answer regarding the treatment of religious minorities by kashmiris
india,removed,what do you want a referendumplebiscite not possible according to un resolutions first pakistan has to remove its army from pok and then india should demilitarise kashmir you know pakistan would never do that and anyways theres no point in conducting any plebiscite today you have altered the demography too much driven out all the religious minorities theres no point
india,removed,you truly believe paki propaganda that people are absolutely happy there
india,removed,who started the oppression was it indian army who took funding from pakistan and murdered pandits in the early
india,removed,of course i support a peaceful resolution between the indian government and the people of kashmir we dont want to deliberately see them suffer but can we really trust kashmiris when so many of them regularly fly paki flags assault our armymen and police support terrorists and turn up in huge amounts to funerals of terrorists kashmiri people have to let go of violence before expecting anything from the indian government violence is no solution
india,removed,are you not an indian
india,removed,it was kashmiris that started the unending cycle of radicalism and bloodshed afspa was only enforced in when the militancy got out of hand its not like india one day decided to oppress those poor innocent kashmiris
india,removed,but he was a member of a terrorist organisation
india,removed,kashmiris should consider themselves lucky that they are born in india and not across the loc we allow kashmiris do have their own constitution and flag give kashmiri students quotas in our universities give them massive funding most government spending per capita hell non kashmiris are not even allowed to own land in kashmir yet they have the gall to assault our armymen and police what more do they want they should stop dreaming of azadi and do something productive with their lives other than aspiring to be wannabe jihadis
india,removed,owaisi is against these terrorists because theyll cut his shia head first
india,removed,shows the true face of islammuslims

india,removed,meanwhile tn is going back to century
india,removed,this is the third media portal with same article and same content such journalism much wow i think the narrative is now visible to uninjanamaka
india,removed,despite all this even if one were to accept that voters may vote slightly differently for state elections visavis national this difference alone cannot explain a bjp loss in up if it were to occur yes this will explain the difference alone it was a national election for which bjp had the face of a strong leader so much so that media coined the term modiwave the upcoming one will be state election people wil choose state leader and bjp has declared no face to lead it imo looking at the swing in votes without looking at the reasons is a fools task alomg with it journalists believing that people have to vote on same lines just shows that they dont expect masses to differentiate between national issues and local issues so much for their intellectual bubble
india,removed,because theyve now stopped believing that psus are sick they now care about job loss only
india,removed,i think someone posted a link to what police says on examining the footage you can check that

india,removed,using statistics to trivialize the plight of individuals is wrong you can do the exact same thing with the death of soldiers deaths to terrorism and even rape happens all the time but see indian rape per capita is so low of course these are all wrong too economics is an important aspect of demonetization but the sociopolitical consequences are very important too doing things that are good for the market are good yes but ignoring the consequences for individuals becomes dangerous think about how us politics has suffered by ignoring the plight of the white working class by going fullon free trade with no compensating redistribution of wealth

india,removed,most of the mohajir generals in paki army are much more rabidly antiindia than regular punjabi folks dont forget the present strategy of cuts to india was designed by none other than up wala generals akhtar abdur rahman rampur and mirza aslam baig azamgarh under the direction of the jalandhari general zia ul haq

india,removed,ban all religious organizations albeit if possible ban all religions itself problem solved be indian
india,removed,as a nonwahabi muslim i feel the government are taking the right steps they have banned zakir naik and his saudi funded organization i hope they ban all foreign funding for religious organizations most of my friends are salafists and the amount of hatred is appaling i had a huge fight when a friend was praising osama for how he took revenge on muslims by committing the salafists with their middle east connections have succeeded with varying degree in homegenizing the muslims the hard line salafists dont consider indian muslims as true muslims and actively work in conversation the money helps in big way this has been silently going on for many years i am glad the government finally acknowledged it germany has banned salafists india should do the same
india,removed,ive heard some hate speeches in the mosque that was bang next door the area was minority dominated so they didnt think much of blasting the speeches on loudspeakers they have for aazaan its not easy to pin them down for any specific hate speech in a very angry voice with very harsh words they will invoke gods ire against vague enemies no names are taken no religion is mentioned but its all fire and brimstone raining down on those who violate gods will listener is forbidden to socialize with heathen like that and if brave to put and end to heresy but theres no direct call for murder these are fishy people think zakir naik add more fundamentalism greater obscurity more hate
india,removed,lets make atheism a normality in india all religious barbarism would come down
india,removed,because we will not kill anybody who laugh at our gods unlike other peaceful religion yet according to leading indian intellectuals hinduism is most violent religion

india,removed,hitler initially wanted to form an alliance with the british as a germanicanglo aryan empire he applauded their dominant rule of india and wanted to use that model to subjugate russia as the war escalated whether or not hitler wouldve wanted to return to this perspective is unknown whether hitler actually would fully support indian independence was improbable with the prospect of having england as an ally india was a sore spot for the empire which hitler could manipulate the same tactic was used for the british war crimes in the other colonies let me go out on a limb and guess your an islamic sympathizer someone disagrees with you and your instinct is to poison the well go fuck yourself learn to discuss ideas like an adult instead of ad hominem slander no im not an islamist sympathizer something that has nothing to do with this topic of dicussion
india,removed,oh mywhat an angry chaddi weve got this time by the way that is true hitler originally wanted to ally with britain rather than fight them until he repeatedly attempted to make peace with them allowing them to retain their colonies and in return taking them into axis as his partner he openly stated that he was not interested in india and even considered british rule in india to be good enough when it was genocidal and thoroughly ruinous same as the nazi occupation of poland it was only when it became clear that britain would continue fighting and the japanese came to occupy entire southeast asia and started invading frontiers of india that he finally decided to help netaji to an extent even then it is well known that if he succeeded hitler and tojo had plans to control india as a wartime puppet state go learn some history before you come spouting your shit here

india,removed,these politiciansnutjobs were talking about their own constituencies and region not whole india and they were correct it can be seen that by three districts muzaffarnagar moradabad and rampur are certain to be muslim majority by in fact rampur is already muslim majority two more bijnor and saharanpur are either going to be muslim majority or else will be very close to muslim majority only two districts bareilly and meerut are likely to be hindu majority in and have been shown so by all models it is worthwhile remembering that both districts were more than per cent hindu in so the reality based on current models is that these districts will be muslim majority by not assam and bengal do have drastic changes in their demographics the author chooses to use data lets use data which i believe being current can be trusted more the most rapid rise in the share of muslims in the total population was witnessed in assam nationally percentage of muslims in total population went up from in to in assam recorded highest increase in share of muslims from of the states population to it is still higher than the national average of for the decade in three districts of bengal murshidabad malda and north dinajpur the muslim population has surpassed the hindu population the famous malda moreover if in india the hindu population has dipped by per cent in bengal it is much higher at per cent correspondingly if the muslim population has increased by per cent in bengal the growth has a higher rate per cent in bengals crore population hindus still comprise crore people or per cent of the population muslims comprise crore population or per cent compared to the census data this is slightly higher for a decade earlier the hindu population in bengal was crore and muslim population was crore bengals population then too was far lesser at crore the only thing constant then and now is the asymmetrical spread of bengals population by religion history says in murshidabad the national tricolor was unfurled two days after august for they had all but taken it that they would cede to east pakistan shows their thinking the author claims that the population of muslims would stabilize between based on data where as they are already at in so will their now decline even after having a high tfr or what this begs questions from the author the editor and the publication why did it use data while writing an article in when data was available did the bjp govt in fudge the data to show less or did upa fudge it in or are both data true and his analysis wrong why didnt scrollin fact check when toi or indianexpress could what is the reason for higher than national average growth of muslim population present in only two states of india bordering bangladesh

india,removed,youd be surprised nepal is like the new pakistan politically they mostly hate us to the core
india,removed,no they hate us indians they dont see us as hindu brothers and sisters actually i asked one nepali why he doesnt acknowledge this brotherhood from him i was able to understand that from decades of brainwashing their leaders created a massive conspiracy and almost pushed forwards a artificially generated narrative that nepali hinduism is poles apart from indian hinduism and shares nothing in common while in reality it is all the same they chant the same mantras as we do in sanskrit and they also have the same problems as we do with untouchability and what not
india,removed,on them how will that work the only way we can do such is to literally buy out those existing media sources with massive fan bases unless we can somehow successfully rise quickly like how buzzfeed did unless your comment is s pr is important we keep forgetting that its also the problem with isro they massively underestimate how important it is
india,removed,the nytimes could be worth instead of billion dollars is not a joke even for some of the richest of course many of these magnates wouldnt buy the thing in whole but enough shares to play a large influencing role even then i wonder why indias msm is so leftist in nature on the other hand
india,removed,nepali citizens also are they pahadi dude look at cnn they are literally no different than pakistanis with their hate of india
india,removed,thats because the right is full of hatred and bigotry the right is yet to come up with its own inclusive yet progressive idea for the future of india the right is unhappy of minority appeasement and what not the right was literally irrelevant just a few decades ago an i find it funny how you can even naïvely label indias left as progressive it is anything but that can you name one right of centre columnist worth reading other than ashok malik whose opinions i disagree with but admire greatly i cant think of one there is a reason for that one big one is since among the right humanities and liberal arts isnt promoted much nor are these rightist columns funded very well many of those who write for it are not very well educated in such and just do it voluntarily perhaps this could be since indias left is generally living in ivory towers with their elitist attitude and their children need not worry about making a living so they can look past engineering and what not

india,removed,just because i am indian doesnt mean i should like all indian things
india,removed,ive never made any attempt to play down climate change as an important issue i have adressed the overpopulation canard multiple times a good way to think about it is to compre india to the only other major country that it even can be compared to china it has had than china india will add another million china has no problems with starvation or even malnourishment to any great extent indias arable land per hectare is likely to stabilise around where china is today or perhaps slightly lower then stay there the notion that indias population is unsustainable is a myth it isnt popular to say that here but it is the problem is extremely inefficient distribution of food and terrible agricultural productivity a legacy of refusing to scale up farms with the result that the average farm has grown smaller in india over the years instead of largerlike in china which helps productivity tldr no problem with climate change but the overpopulation canard is a popular myth that refuses to die
india,removed,as you said the crowd on this sub is the privileged crowd this crows will have less than children on average anyways how are you going to shun old conservative culture in rural india how do you even define women empowerment empowerment to do what exactly if you are reading this you might be among top income of indians who have privilege but think about indians and their quality of life what if the top of indians went childfree what would be the impact on overall numbers the are already living in abject poverty how will you convince them not to have more children to replace the ones they give up for adoption
india,removed,over population argument was used even httpsfeeorgarticlesoverpopulationtheperennialmyth the opening quotation was penned by tertullian a resident of the city of carthage in the second century when the population of the world was about million or only three to four percent of what it is today and the fear of overpopulation did not begin with tertullian one finds similar concerns expressed in the writings of plato and aristotle in the fourth century bc as well as in the teachings of confucius as early as the sixth century bc now lets say there is over population problem and we use your solution who the hell is going to feed india in year later when inddias median age would be httpswwwgooglecoinsearchqindiamedianage problem is technological we dont have the right technology to support this much population

india,removed,wow your ignorance is astounding a very significant majority in jk is muslim and since they are muslim they want to join pakistan thats the most communal thing ive read all day the so called liberals are one of the reasons behind backwardness of muslims you are a telling example also every single word in that sentence is wrong first of all demographics the state has a significant minority population close to add to that the or more pandits who had to flee fearing persecution even if the minority was less than how do they become irrelevant what are you even talking about dude secondly only of population in jk wants to join pakistan according to a survey conducted by a think tank based in uk chatham house back in i believe the highest percentages were in kashmir valley and even that was only this must come as a shock to you but even among muslims support for joining pakistan is less than which makes you wonder why pakistan is making all the noise about kashmir its pure strategic my friend dont fall for this stupid propaganda all in all in jk preferred independence while from the so called azad kashmir or pok wanted independence from pakistan so the verdict is anything but onesided yes there is a sentiment for independence among majority muslims in kashmir but thats about it what about buddhists hindus sikhs christians and the minority muslims in the state who wants to remain part of india what the actual fuck dude the survey was apparently sponsored by former libyan leader muhammed gaddaffis son it is said that he was expecting a propakistan result so that he can raise the issue in several forums before ranting on subjects like these without any actual knowledge
india,removed,you dont have to think that other groups willmay demand the same the zealots in kashmir are more vociferous cuz they regularly get assistance monetarily and man power from across the border they also have driven out the sane people away and keep badgering the kashmiris who support india as gaddar and buzdils pervez rasool and shah faisal

india,removed,what else can be expected from a city of ugly smelly castist sexually repressed population
india,removed,as an indian who loves his country a lot just like everyone here i think kashmiris the terrorist fundamentalist types not the good ones who believe in india are full on madarchots and only leech on central government money this money could have much more use if given to a bimaru state they have no source of revenue and dont want to work they dont let indians work and study nit srinagar in kashmir but happily shit on jobs and education seats all over india further on the ethnic cleansing of pandits was just deplorable and we should send all kashmiris to pakistan lets see if they then appreciate india after being ass fucked by pakistanis on all fronts

india,removed,there are typically a lot of posts every week that get vote brigaded off the front page may i ask why all the ones that are highlighted in this thread are only those relating to criticism of the bjp or hindutva
india,removed,why is that because our cm takes the stature of his office seriously and doesnt go around making statements like modi wants to kill me thats what im most irritated about these guys seem like the trump of india noisy and too uncouth to be the cm of the most literate and the richest state in india i mean our prime minister shri modiji has said pretty much the same thing more than once i think we can safely ignore such statements here is one such instance the real issue that bhakts are having here is that kejriwal is using every trick in the book perfected by modi against modi
india,removed,this guy fucks
india,removed,indian media is fully exploiting the rape stories with sensationalist headlines almost everyday now one thing they do harass them till death their parents and victim then linebyline coverage of what they say indian media should stop this kind of coverage of stories with sensationalist headlines daily crime stories are becoming the leading competition for media all our problems causing these crimes should be systematically solved not with sensationalist coverage of every case in a nation of billion people western media picks these sensationalist crimes for all media india is a paradise for coverage because billion people you could find all kinds of horror stories

india,removed,my unsophisticated reply to baiters after myanmar ops the army used the exact same wording along the loc only because they want to maintain sanctity of loc to get an idea as to why exactly the official statement wording is like this watch yesterdays ndtv buck stops here where former diplomats ambassador kc singh and g parthasarathy explain eloquently why the specific set of wording is used also when asked by media people whether soldiers did cross loc dgmo did say yes its not like the operations were deep into pok they were pretty much along loc just on the paki side that is lets have a look at paki reactions yesterday first paki ispr denies surgical strikes then nawaz condemns naked aggression then khwaja moron confirms paki soldiers dead in indian small arms firing then comes janjua who warns of retaliation if further strikes happen now fast forward to evening whilst indians are celebrating all pak channels including dawn starts running stories of paki army retaliatory artillery firing and shelling destroying indian bops and killing indian soldiers dawn even reported indian army deserted their jawans bodies and capturing a young indian soldier yeah you heard it right paki army captured a indian soldier in loc firing lol funny thing is the supposed retaliation to indian firing happened early morning yet it took hours for this news to come out in paki media anyhow in just a matter of time ghq pr stunt hits a roadblock and stories of indian soldier being captured and all withdrawn from most paki papers including dawn now that indian military has released statement saying the guy was an inadvertent post deserter pakis have swallowed their claims and now suggesting no indian in their custody obviously coward paki army taking it all to the poor soldier prayers with him praveen swami is a baiter with a reverse boner for modi no better than your typical randian modi baiter there are many non jingoist defence analysts who are not govt sympathisers like manu pubby saurav jha etc so dont lean on mole swami to prove your point

india,removed,okay so what are you trying to say do you mean to say all muslims inherently possess these characteristics or do you agree that perhaps it is upbringing education and a number of other factors that might contribute to it
india,removed,inbreeding
india,removed,jet fuel cant melt bteams
india,removed,this son of a bitch has hit the nail kudos for putting the truth out to the people
india,removed,if x calls my father a pedophile and i live in ys house who has no relation with x and if i riot in ys house because my feelings are hurt then would it make sense then how does this make sense and i thought moderate muslims believed in freedom of speech i mean when the hindus protested not rioted against pk there were many muslims who were in complete support of the freedom of speech and fuck the self entitled hindus too who cant take a small joke
india,removed,i know its not politically correct i know it bigoted but here goes personal experience so inherent bias i work in the healthcare sector when there is a patient screaming creating a ruckus refusing to pay hospital bills you can bet its a muslim in the picu if we are unable to save the child after nearly days of struggle no other community will create a scene and by that i mean get a mob threaten and verbally abuse they doctors break windows these arent poor ignorant muslims i keep telling myself its a coincidence and its not fair to generalize but its difficult only per cent of snakes are poisonous but when we see one we dont check if it poisonous or not we will be careful and maybe even kill it that is the truth
india,removed,as someone else has pointed out poverty illiteracy a lot of them attend religious schools so never learn nonreligious perspective to be honest its a global problem nobody wants to discriminate against them but they make it harder for everyone i once was just plain curious and went on to watch many many documentaries about the beginning of islam and the one common denominator i found in all of them is they want to consistently feel like they belong to some larger than life goal of being a muslim a lot of part about being a muslim is to lead life in a very islamic way or else you are missing out on your true purpose thats what they believe i have met some liberal pakistanis yes and i once asked them about their view of religion all of them echoed the thought that even though they are not religious they feel they would miss out on the deeper revelation if they dont lead their life in islamic way a lot of them are extremely strong in their opinions and are very proud of their culture religion add to that the fact that their holy place is governed by an extremist country which only adds to the confusion of what is right and what is wrong from their perspective mostly islam is very a strong identity for a lot of them and they find not following it as being unfaithful i do feel the modern world in their eyes is unislamic so this makes them a bit on the regressive side again there is obviously a bit of selection bias they are many educated ones who go on to get integrated with rest of the world while being religious in their personal lives they dont create a scene and we dont hear stories about them
india,removed,abrahmic religions
india,removed,you shit in the street like a bunch of savages
india,removed,they take their religion a bit too seriously and might have a bit of a persecution complex
india,removed,this is not a loweffort post
india,removed,in general all of the abrahamic relegions believe only their god is true and all others are false also they believe in their holy book litereally in us especially in the south you would be surprised how many people believe that the earth was created in days and that evolution is a threat to their religious belief
india,removed,a lot of it honestly has to do with the fact that many muslim community leaders leaders of those all india muslim board or whatever it is just dont want to reduce their powers and authority same reason why civil servants like the license raj system more job stability and opportunities for kickbacks
india,removed,to put it simply they dont questions their belief thoughts if theres a way to point out and say why this why not that can you develop a string of original thoughts its also an identity clash muslims of india mainly wore their local attire but with todays external influx its changing to the arab world style of clothing as well there are exmuslim groups on reddit none the less some people do realize that faith needs to be kept at home and not spread around and praised every single day
india,removed,just to add all the other points here muslims believe that the words of god are found in the quran that is the highest source for morality law
india,removed,because islam is an absolute religion either you are a muslim or you are worthless if you are a deity worshiper even worse on top of that it is a dying religion having no significance in modern world but having a rich heritage once you start losing your grip on things in life you hold on to things that were once dear to you the same goes for islam it was once of the most progressive religion once but has lost its shine since then muslims are trying to grab their religion as close to them which is essentially sticking to books written more than a millennium ago full of bigotry and violence
india,removed,i think they are fighting for their very existence if you look back even just a century islam was still a very progressive culture muslim countries were socially quite open and were moving forward only over the last years has this changed from religious leaders being the butt of all jokes they have now taken over everything and this change began mostly after the rise of arab nationalism which in term came as a reaction to imperialism of the west and subsequently the creation of a zionist state in what they considered arab lands this is not different from how things happened in india tbh around half of india did not recongnize the concept of religion only culture or tradition it was to fight the british that a hindu identity was created honestly the word hindu does not have a history of being linked to people of the religion more than a century ago it was thru a common identity that a movement was able to gain traction and then on to independence the arabs went thru the same cycle he difference here was the rise of wahhabism that states that one can coerce another towards religion using force if neccesary the wahabis gained control of the arabian peninsula and it would have remained like that had not they discovered oil now with the money and the powerinfluence that comes with being rich they were able to export their ideology all over the muslim countries parralel to this was the american and russian games played over most visibly afghanistan that gave rise to the terrorist superground either way they have gone from being chill to being very insulated and now fear everything as an attack on their identity
india,removed,just curious which list are you talking about in httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofriotsinindia its been mostly hindus vs muslims after
india,removed,sad how being a hindu and speaking out about such is now a crime
india,removed,muslims in welloff european countries still want sharia laws
india,removed,where are the loud moderate voices in islam in hinduism if someone like rss tries to impose their brand of hinduism more likely than not it will be hindus and regular people who themselves will be dismissive of it if rss demanded all hindus to pray for minutes times everyday hindus will be the first to oppose it in islam i hardly hear any moderateagnostic voices people like ayan hirsi ali tasleema nasreen etc question islam they will be name called and probably censored not just by pc left but by so called moderate muslims themselves there are some shia sects and communities like bohris khojas ahmadiyas etc who are quite liberal but they are not considered real muslims the fact is that almost all religion especially eastern religions be it shinto tao hinduism buddhism have by its mere fact of lacking a central authority have been able to change reform and adapt even the fissures in christianity between protestant and catholics and later the quakers and evangelicals has slowly made them change to survive in changing times islam or muslims dont feel the need to change to survive for them it seems changing everything around them is only considered as path to survival of islam i feel sorry for many innocent people caught in the islamic struggle in middleeast i live in an area populated by afghani iraqi syrian refugees but seeing that they strongly refuse to integrate in the local culture and beliefs or even law i can totally understand why muslims have it bad
india,removed,you are waiting because you are obsessed with modi
india,removed,of all the things they need good education they are stuck on century thinking
india,removed,a lot of the comments here seem to be biased against muslims for ex when some patient is screaming you can bet its a muslim you are drawing stereotypes islam is an organized religion i think a lot of its problems stem from it the power structure mullah local priest or whatever want to control how the religion is practised and make sure no one deviates ie moves away from the ground rules there are many muslim countries turkey kazakhstan where you will find the majority of muslims being nondenominational or nonobservant these people have muslims but they dont have an organization at the local level forcing people to follow a track i have met many nonobservant muslims with liberal views and a modern outlook with who you can have an intellectual discussion this is a slippery slope the op said he is an atheist and he has nothing against but promptly got into specific cases which led him down the stereotyping route and other comments followed suit no doubt reinforced by personal experience but personal experience is a function of what youve been exposed to there are different sorts out there is an argument thats hard to make if thats too exceptional or non existent in your experience
india,removed,two reasons one is that many muslims are economically weak and islam inherently has faults both these act in varying proportions we can minimize it by economic upliftment but ultimately there has to systemic reforms in the religion for one political parties need to look for nonclerical representatives of the community as allies
india,removed,they riot on the smallest of things i was going through the wikipedia of riots and was quite shocked to see that most of them involved muslims at one side seems you have not heard of rss the premier hindu nationalist terror organisation of india they get away by downplaying their role and partly because of our short term memories but if you look at their behavior against the backdrop of their actions the truth emerges it just a coincidence that rss member killed gandhiji it just a coincidence that rss members put idols inside babri masjid claimed they miraculously appeared there it just a coincidence that rss members spread rumor and lied about lord rams miraculous appearance that resulted in ′s of deaths in the resulting riots it just a coincidence that rss members were involved in babri riots it just a coincidence that rss members were involved in godhra riots it just a coincidence that rss members were given military training to take to demolish babri masjid it just a coincidence that rss runs camps which brainwahses young kids to hate on other religions it just a coincidence that rss runs camps that gives arms training to young kids it just a coincidence that rss and friends is indicted in cases involving rdx bombs in india it just a coincidence that rss is involved in ahmedabad riots it just a coincidence that rss is involved in bhiwandi riots in it just a coincidence that rss is involved in tellicherry riots in it just a coincidence that rss is involved in jamshedpur riots in it just a coincidence that rss is involved in kanyakumari riots of it just a coincidence that rss is involved in bhagalpur riots in it just coincidence that rss and friends are involved attacking movie theatres in protest against shahrukh khans dilwale movie it just coincidence that rss and friends are involved in running a campaign against aamir khan to uninstall snapdeal app to affect his commercial prospects for his thought on growing intolerance it just a coincidence that rss and friends threatened hindu girl vidya dinker with rape and violence for her stand against their goondaism it just coincidence that rss and friends are involved in burning alive of graham staines and his children it just coincidence that rss and friends are involved in malegaon blasts it just coincidence that rss and friends are investigated for samjhauta express twin bombings it just a coincidence that rss and friends are investigated for ajmer dargah attack it just a coincidence that rss and friends are investigated for malegaon blasts it just a coincidence that rss and friends are investigated for mecca masjid bombings it just a coincidence that police officer is transferred for not squashing cases against rss and friends for their involvement in instigating riots it just a coincidence that rss guy dressed up in burqa throws beef into temple to instigate communal disharmony it just a coincidence that rss an friends were caught giving death threats to author ananthmurthy in twitter it just a coincidence that rss and friends beat up girls in mangalore for going to pubs it just a coincidence that rss and friends attack couples on friendship day it just a coincidence that rss and friends attack couples on valentines day it just a coincidence that rss and friends were involved in dadri lynching incident in which mohammed aqlaq was lynched to death and his son seriously injured on rumors that they had beef in the house it just a coincidence that rss is involved in love jihad hate campaign dal attacks on tipu jayanti from yogi adityanath maharaj khattar som sharma mohan bhagwat vijayavargiya singh shah pakistan will celebrate jyoti ramzadon haramzadon
india,removed,exactly op doesnt know jack about economics and is trying to prove that the economy is doing bad its really funny
india,removed,can i just say it is appalling that this sub is this way how can all of you agree with this incredibly stereotypical view they riot on the smallest of things are you kidding me didnt a group of hindus riot throughout an entire city to have their caste status recognized by the government just a few weeks ago when was the last muslim riot again i feel that perhaps i am the only muslim in this thread and on this sub perhaps this may be a metaphor for how the muslim feels in india why should he believe that he should change when everyone around him believes he is someone he is not and when no one will stand up next to him why have we let bias only see the murderers who call themselves muslims and never lastly in all religions change happens slowly so too in islam but change does happen if you believe it doesnt then you do not read enough about it for example in islam usury was once thought to be forbidden to the extent that one could not take any transaction which had interest attached to it this would mean that muslims cannot take out home loans etc however as the world moved forward and this became necessary for peoples livelihoods islamic scholars after lots of legal study and thought found a solution httpsenwikipediaorgwikimurabaha this was a very obscure contract mentioned briefly in very old islamic law books and today it is the most used form of shariacompliant financial instrument but it did not happen as soon as interestbased transactions began to take up a large part of the economy saudi arabia a few years back this is a major change because in the quran it says something which many believe means of course this is httpwwwmisconceptionsaboutislamcomwifebeatingquranhtm and the arabs have shown that they will take the contested version over being known for domestic violence in the century these are the ways religions changes slowly change takes time but it does happen this is because the interpreters of islam on earth are men try as they might they can never be god so as the world changes their interpretations will change and the religion will change all religions change slowly all religions change from within all religions change if you do not study islamic law etc how will you know of these changes
india,removed,because they are all fanatic assholes even the nice muslim guys in your circles if he is even a little bit religious is in fact an extremist douchebag lpt dont discuss religion with muslims if you dont want to be grossed out by extreme levels of retardedness

india,removed,you guys are practically cousins thats a very ignorant and insensitive statement that betrays a lack of will to delve deeper and understand subtleties like saying to the rwandans hey why do you hutus and tutsis fight so much you guys practically are so similar or saying why do chechens and russians fight so much they appear so much the same do you know how diverse india is do you know which people of india are the pakistanis culturally close to pakistan chose to secede from india because they wanted to live apart the basis of their separation was religion which they still consider an unfinished business and yet you say hatred is in india honestly it is disappointing and mysterious a russian would say something like this guess times have changed
india,removed,the last paragraph is rage inducing and pretty much sums up the communal tension in bengals rural areas the family of the deceased has informed that earlier they used to live in a muslim inhabited village but had to move in to their current location owing to the atrocities of the local muslim goons they had a hard time selling their old house because of the goons but had somehow managed to sell it at a cheaper price thanks to a cpm leader

india,removed,i think we should just ignore them if you notice carefully there are quite a few troll accounts or maybe paid shills in this sub some examples which come to my mind myself walrus programming guy dr redz etc i fact quite a few throwaway accounts were also created immediately after the demonetisation announcement berating the government normally it is good to hear perspectives of someone who does not share your own viewpoint however the kind of negativity by some of such accounts was absolutely frustrating infact they used to fight sane voices and spout negativity such as banana republic leave this shithole etc doesnt take a lot of time to figure out that they are here only with a particular agenda hardly posting in any other discussions besides politics etc so please ignore that is what i did the downside is because of these buggers normal people like u n i stop posting much hence their posts get even more amplified also as devegowda said it is easy to criticise that is what these pessimists do

india,removed,i at length about this yesterday the biggest casualty in this economic disaster is indias longterm image for investors india needs to up its manufacturing as a percentage to gdp to at least in order to rapidly industrialise as the east asians did foxconn because of the large domestic market will be more or less forced to stay in the country but what does an episode like this tell them massive incompetence them staying in the country is no guarantee that they will increase their investments beyond what they need at a minimum instead weve been treated by people like ufauladisingh that the measurement of success is supposedly the up elections next year as if political success is a reliable estimate of economic policy being successful electorally doesnt necessarily mean that youre being successful economically as the article makes clear the governments move to ban rs and rs notes from november has had a domino effect on the mobile phone industry where a large majority of mobile phones are bought for less than rs and most of the transactions happen through cash so even if all your workers are being paid digitally it wont matter because most customers still pay in cash that will be true tomorrow as well as years from now india is decades away from a cashless society anyone who thinks otherwise is a blithering idiot who needs to spend more than seconds looking at the economic data but guys all that matters is the up elections next year if modi wins there then it absolves all blame forget the economic fallout

india,removed,because the government has with extreme transparency shared the decision making process for this initiative it has revealed who all were involved it has been open about data around the progress and not gagged any institution to reveal information it has clearly laid down the metrics for the measurement of the success and failure of the process it has categorically stated that long term benefits will accrue and short term pain is inevitable deaths loss of livelihood economic slowdown in the interim are just collateral damage the fm has been humble in all his speeches and understands the ground realities and has not labelled the people questioning the scheme as paid opposition stooges the pm has not cried many a time not done a photo op in golden temple did not send his year old mother to a bank as a pr stunt has not labelled people criticising the scheme as pakistan like operators because the pm and fm are honorable men but most importantly pm has just called himself a real life batman dark knight if you please and i for one am afraid of the masked crusader

india,removed,you are a top of the tier moron so if banks are to be trusted with peoples money on an unprecedented scale wouldnt it have made sense to first rinse out the corruption within the banks firstfix all the loopholes bring them under more govt oversight impose penalties and enforce stringent policies i meanhow can you dictate people to lend all their money to such inherently corrupt institutions

india,removed,history proves that the indian government would rather massacre everyone in tamil nadu rather than allow them to become a sovereign nation just look at what they did to punjab they will never let tamil nadu go my heart goes out to all the other oppressed peoples in india india is being governed for the benefit of a handful of states states like tamil nadu and punjab are being exploited for our natural resources if the central government is going to steal punjab and tamil nadus water then at the very least they should introduce methods to curtail the population of the states that are dependent on punjab and tamil nadus water it kills me that the highest population states in india are the nonriparian states why the hell does rajasthan have million people in that state when its mostly desert then they complain that they dont have any water the thar desert which comprises a large part of rajasthans land area is the most densely populated desert on earth with people per square kilometer only in india will you see a desertstate that has a population of millon call me crazy but i think deserts should be sparsely populated what right does rajasthan one of the most populous states in india have to complain about water shortages when there population is so staggeringly high and they live in the desert it defies logic rajasthanis have been getting free water from punjab for the last years from that fucking piece of shit indira gandhi canal meanwhile punjabi farmers are committing suicide because they no longer have enough water to irrigate their own crops because so much water is being given to the nonriparian states of delhi haryana and rajasthan i hope tamil nadu does successfully secede because then punjab could finally secede and we could actually use some of our own river water instead of just giving it away to rajasthan delhi and haryana and literally getting nothing in return if the indian government is going to continue treating states like punjab and tamil nadu like its their job to take care of the ever growing population of india then they are sadly mistaken if it werent for tamil nadu and punjab india would be finished maybe someone should remind the central government that if it werent for punjab and tamil nadu the country would not function the central government is punishing punjabis and tamils to keep on rewarding the useless eaters of india especially rajasthan and its million thirsty rajasthanis who just keep on increasing their population every year despite living in a desert

india,removed,you dismiss all criticism of your broken culture to theyre only saying that because were dark instead of honest introspection i think you didnt read my other comment where i gave detail introspection on the issue please have a read and give your feedback thanks tamil people care deeply about traditional tamil culture and tamil people also care deeply about animal including humans welfare we do not have a way to verify what percentage of jallikattu events are being mishandled resulting in hurt and suffering for the bull but lets say if it is true lets say that at of the jallikattu events such things occur does that mean the high court should ban all jallikattu in tamil nadu if thats the logic then if yes then we should also ban all animal slaughter because more than of slaughterhouses do things like this if yes then we should also ban muslims from celebrating eid and any other religion that has animal killing because more than of them do things like this so assuming that you are rational and we acknowledge that in todays india we cant force everyone to be vegetarian then the solution is not to ban jallikattu but to fully legalize it like it was for the past years manage it monitor it and penalize people who do things that are against traditional tamil culture where the bulls must be treated with great respect dignity and kindness and so too for the humans who put themselves at risk to perform the tradition that is what tamil people expect

india,removed,clearly sarcasm and hyberbole you do not get you also dont get basic logic if the ec those kids as i said are unemployable india does not create jobs in large part due to an uneducated population so on one hand you have a lack of industry being created due to red tape and archaic structures combind with a lack of capital formation stemming from lack of education and on the other hand those who do graduate are not educated the education system being severely underfunded like i said bjp state and central allocations have been pretty much consistent with other states and previous budgets so literally nothing here that you say is meaningful aside it from being an empty rant to shift goalposts are you a moron no they dont how many times does it have to be explained to you gujarat ranks on girls education it just came out yesterday rajasthan has one of the worst education systems in the country lmao delhi has the highest gdp per capita because it has an iit jnu and du how silly and reductionist can you get delhi is an urban city state the highest per capita income cities in india re delhi mumbai chennai bangalore hyderabad not because education but because these are manufacturing and most importantly service hubs also not bothering with the rest of your post as you clearly cannot discuss without getting into juvenile name calling and trolling delhi manufactures nothing a southie like who doesnt even live in delhi is an expert in delhi now delhi is mostly services as are cities like mumbai to be in the services industry you need education youre not going to address the issues because youre a typical ignorant right wing troll who knows that to increase education taxes will have to go up and thats the real issues baniyas also known as bjp supporters dont want to pay their tax y

india,removed,burqa is mostly a cultural thing doesnt have much to do with the quran
india,removed,i found this httpswwwquoracomwhatisthebusinessmodelofreliancejio article to be a decent explanation of the potential move
india,removed,this is sad but it was necessary bangalore has worst reputation for morality in india woman wear tight jeans top that show belly button and provocative clothes they show no respect to indian consitutuion and values and wear evil lbd lusty b dress and drink alcohol they have one night stand and give std to their family they spread hiv if you disrespect indian values and dress like slut you will be shame and treated like slut today americans say we should make indian mother and sister wear tight clothes and jeans and be self control it is not about self control it is about self respect it is about traditional value it is about morality and decency maybe with this sad occasion they will learn their mistake and not do bad things again i condemn this attack but i also condemn women who think they can wear skimby clothes and insult men
india,removed,as the other person who responded to you has said burqa is purely cultural no where in the quran does it say that cover up women like ninjas the only advice for women is to dress up modestly no revealing clothes if you go with the claims of muslims pagan arab women would dress with the intention to seduce the advice in the quran then makes sense
india,removed,burqas have no place in any country especially india turbans should also have no place in any country
india,removed,burqas have no place in any country especially india you can shove the quran up your arse if you use it justify an archaic and downright disgusting and tragic practice so does a ghoonghat covered down till the neck areanear a male or a group of malewe wont eat the womans face out to be donned like thatno where youd shove that bhagwad gita is your choice

india,removed,true op doesnt realise that day to day life in india is really really difficult and competitive by western standards i mean i stay late at office just to avoid boarding peak hour train and so we indians naturally develop a somewhat aggressive and cynical personality when everything getting job paying bills educating kids not dying of pollution is a struggle anyone will be frustrated europeans have it easyyy their teenagers even get a € gift from government to spend on movie and concerts etc no pressure to go to college or get a job due to welfare schemes if your life is so easy and future is taken care of you will be chilled out no worries no frustration and anger it has nothing to do with drinking and making generalisations after spending months uheeyyyyyy is a fucking joke some idiot even gilded this randians are just out of touch with ground realities it seems

india,removed,i can tell you that the bengali guy would be the first to die they are beta males
india,removed,my view on bjp staying in power depends on next years of rule i think they will get next term unless they cluster fuck up recent demonetization related moves and subsequent policies modi is a good leader for given situation of deep rooted corruption and social issues in india however i see a hint of agression and a hidden dictator in him and i am afraid him ruling too many terms is not good for india and democracy we need to find a good opposition leader to balance out things muslims wanted a seperate country and they got pakistan they tried to grab kashmir too while they are seperating saying kashmir has high muslim population and other reasons but polticians and army on both sides fucked up kashmir from bothsides after partition and there are many reasons as why pakistan wants kahmir and india does not want to let it go slowly pak started infiltration and terrorism and made things even more complicated this is a deadlock with arguments from both parties and media propaganda and religious dimensions and multiple wars made this worser my personal take on kashmir is it should belong to india since muslims got a seperate country and demanding kashmir is pure greed for natural resources strategic geopolitical advantage and fresh water reources to justify this they use same religion and army occupation etc as reasons i think british fucked this up too and india already gave up pakistan and giving up some more does not sound right to me while they got what they want if i were pakistan i would be happy i got what i wanted ruled it the best to bring up it to be good economy and country purely my personal take and thought process on this

india,removed,never seen a more uneducated government in my life we messed up by not repealing afspa partially in return for the peace that lingered years back kashmir deserved better from us use some of that grey matter i know rss sevaks cant really think beyond gaumutra but try we had a clear chance to put kashmir on the path to peace but idiots and their supporters have fucked it up completely thumping their chest like a bunch of children i agree just that i see violent and separatist kashmiris as the idiots why dont you learn to use google bjp supporters constantly trying to overcompensate for their small cocks by supporting mindless violence when none is necessary are the real idiots you can go on rworldnews and rant whatever you want about whatever place in the world similarly people are ranting here there is no relation between things said here and things done there since the we have greatly improved our intelligence our security apparatus in j k and weve fenced the entire border along the loc the blunt and bitter truth that all of the people crying for kashmiri peace like you are afraid to see is that there is no permanent solution for the kashmir issue till we accept that most kashmiris support the separists and dont want to be in india given a choice reason doesnt work with these terrorists its about time government takes some hard steps and crush this once and for all i think the bjp needs to pull its head out of its ass and think about what iron hand means the current situation is like a virus it can be nipped in the bud or it can be allowed to fester and turn into something ugly its like a child who refuses to take medicine because the medicine is bitter as a parent sometimes firmness is called for to prevent future problems wow for you the need of the hour the first contribution you need to make is to rename a mass murderer who belonged to a cult of mass murderers dude just how misinformed are you where are you getting all this bullshit from hindus were never more than of the population in kashmir i also see that you have not provided a single country where a minority of its citizens on the sole basis of religion have managed to clense another group again on the basis of religion and have not had any retaliation from the majority of the country i dont if its just a sjw disease or an inability to see whats going on due to blinders whatever it is learn to look deeper at root causes again that same old roadside aashiq logic kashmiris dont have to like you or want to be with you just because you think that you did something for them i am sorry i didnt realize that you aide and abet murder and murderers and glorify people who have no respect for life all in the name of silly tribal religion hindus of india had for centuries oppressed dalits and that oppression was waaay worse than anything kashmiri muslims have done to kps so he was killed for the crime of tweeting go spread your poison and hatemongering elsewhere dude keep worshipping a silly murderer rss and people and organizations associated with rss have killed many muslims across the country does that make modi a terrorist was bhagat singh a terrorist or a militant how deluded are you guys to not see that every single freedom fighting terrorist militant outfit was not created by afghanis arabs and pakistanis is headed by pakistanis based out of pok and clearly has deep ties to the pakistani state you expect us to swallow the wholesale lie that outfits created by pakistanis palestinians algerians saudi arabs ubl and aya and funded by saudis and the isi maintaining their hq and training camps in pakistan whose entire leadership cadre is comprised of pakistanis is an organic freedom movement representing the anger of the people of kashmir by your amazing logic the isis are also freedom fighters even more so considering their leadership at least is iraqi or syrian and they are fighting to liberate iraq and syria kashmiris want to break away from india and join an islamic state we are keeping them in india against their will wish these people had the same mentality when pakistan attacked them in they had no problem merging with india back then you seem to have problems understanding consent watch this video stop that stupid tea shit right there keep shitty facebook things on facebook mmmkay kashmir was not hari singhs personal property how sweet purge everyother religious group out there and then talk about irrespective of religion that is exactly what a plebiscite is how old are yes you can just like khalistan ulfa and whoever comes next if it is not then fuck the constitution i guess there is a reason kashmiris want freedom from the indian constitution lol you clearly have an agenda and heavy bias nation states jaye ma chudane amirite you seem to have a problem understanding how decisions are made in an emergency situation to anyone who thinks that india is less jingoistic than pakistan take a good hard look at this thread nice out of context quote there i am not your history teacher when did i support their desire to kill you are full of bs you are full of cognitive dissonance lol did your account get hacked or something nope still the same person paid bjp shill and everything i pity your ignorancecomparing indian independence struggle against foreign rulers to bouts of domestic violence within the state how do you think we are treating kashmiris in jk here are some examples you come across as a person who does not take a good look at himself in the mirror otherwise you would know that your hands are covered in blood you are a supporter of people who kill for jihad you are a supporter of people who massacred and ethnically clensed an entire community and drove them out because of their religion youre either ignorant or too naive can we also deal with gaurakhashaks in the same way plis
india,removed,the internal terrorism lie again here maybe some objectivity would help how is any outfit started by abdulkader mokhtari algerian ilyas kashmiri a pakistani who served in the pakistani ssg no less sajjad afghani pakistani again who cut his teeth under ubl in afghanistan and maulana masood azar pakistani afghanistan vet considered a kashmiri militant outfit in the first place even the current boss of hum that is burhan wanis boss is fazlur khalilia pakistani how deluded are you guys to not see that every single freedom fighting terrorist militant outfit was not created by afghanis arabs and pakistanis is headed by pakistanis based out of pok and clearly has deep ties to the pakistani state this is not even rconspiracy this is an objective fact look up the names i mentioned see their lineage and history all of them are non indians served in afghanistan got funding by saudi intelligence and the isi and after the soviets were defeated spread across from bosnia to chechnya to kashmir this is why this sudden hate is relevant it is being driven by outsiders who are only doing zias bidding of bleeding india by waging a war of a thousand cuts why go into the past let us look at currently active kashmiri terror outfits and see where they are hqd and who they are headed by hum hq azad kashmir headed by fazlur khalili pakistani hizbul mujahideen hq azad kashmir founded by mohd ahsan dar azad kashmiri by birth pakistani current head syed salahudeen he is indian so that is indian heading a terror outfit so far let got its seed funding from ubls vc fund for terror outfits based out of azad kashmir founded by hafiz saeed pakistani and abdullah yusuf azam a palestinian arab who was a cofounder of aq currently headed by saeed pakistani jem founded by mazood azhar pakistani hqd in azad kashmir though azhar is reportedly based out karachi jklf though it is extinct now is arguably the only native kashmiri freedom movement you expect us to swallow the wholesale lie that outfits created by pakistanis palestinians algerians saudi arabs ubl and aya and funded by saudis and the isi maintaining their hq and training camps in pakistan whose entire leadership cadre is comprised of pakistanis is an organic freedom movement representing the anger of the people of kashmir

india,removed,remember you live in australia and as such western rules apply whatever that douche thinks you two are not in india or pakistan and as such you should deal with in the appropriate way hr they will fix it if he persists remember that he is also scared about his employment he cant pull strings or contacts in the west he is vulnerable use that against him
india,removed,report to the police
india,removed,police complaint should be your step i hope you do not respond with a verbal threat cuz he may file a complaint from his side and since his wife is in the scene as well he may falsely claim that you guys were getting a bit too fresh with her
india,removed,with go mutra shower
india,removed,bang his wife
india,removed,if he is threatening you he is at great risk he being from pakistan hope he realizes that if you complain about his violentthreats he might be in big trouble as the aussies might put him on some list and consider him a threat not just to you but to others as well being from pakistan he should have been extra cautious tell his wife that if you complain he might end up being considered a potentialthreat which might lead to extradition
india,removed,now we have hard dick and dick head together
india,removed,this is idiotic collect evidence like a phone recording etc report the damn thing to the police and campus officials stop working with the dude and his wife end of story how difficult is this for an international student to understand
india,removed,you are in australianot indiai feel his fake patriotism is rising staying in a foreign landits nothing serious anyway first warn this guy that you will report to police if he doesnt stop if he still continues just tell the police they will deal with it you dont have to worry at all
india,removed,id suggest you give him a nice little hug and tell him to take it easy and not let the politicians decide your relationship looks nothing serious to me but of course you are a better judge
india,removed,honestly i dont understand the animosity between people of these two nations what drives this hatred and ragei mean if we look at it macroscopically its just a bunch of greedy dudes wanted to get in power so they demanded a seperate nation and played the religion card aggravating people in the process and ultimately getting the power they seeked is it the inculcation of the feeling of resentment amongst one another in the masses from the early age if yes who is responsible for that parents teachers media government i was very young when kargil war took place and after that i constantly observed peoples and especially medias hate toward the people across the border over the years initially i was influenced by all this and i can forgive me for that as i was merely a preteen as i grew up i realized that most people have blind fondly accepted that each pakistani is their arch enemy without giving it a thought as to why do they think so and the constant feedback from all sorts of media has escalated it to great heights i personally believe that its not like people all of a sudden get vile and start acting out weirdits just that in so called peace time everyone has their this hate inflicting instinct buried inside themwhen some sort of event happens that act as a trigger to release those all deeply ingrained emotions and people act out of it without giving any thought to logic this i think is happening to your colleagues and yourself he acted out of his emotions and you have a huge urge to act on that though i commend you for not letting it out yet what you can do you can talk to him man to man and ask him why the news of terrorist conflict in home nation affect their work here ask him whether his govt made him a representative of his nation if he doesnt seem to bother with his attitude then you can politely tell him to fuck off and can stay away from him just ignore him and if it hurt your work then try talking with your manager or in charge and narrate him the whole thing lastly drink beer and chill man no need to bicker about the things going on in the world if you want to get frustrated then frustrate over global warming climate change and that coral reef destruction by shipping industry on east shore of the country you are presently living inask your oz mates to fucking not repeat mistake that we do over here every election and elect someone better
india,removed,inform hr but try to resolve rather than escalate issue via hr it might just be that he doesnt get good he is coming across as or he might really be serious which means that hr needs to take action
india,removed,ji abhi to hum sirf hands join kar rahe hain aap dekhna kuch dino main hum poore hi jud jayenge welding kara lenge ji
india,removed,in case you really want to take action report them to department of immigration or afp its not worthwhile having a knife puncturing your kidney his wife being pregnant does not mean you need to get a cesarean
india,removed,he is simply being a chut its easy in a country like australia to handle this record some evidence of him saying shit and report to police australia is a hotbed for islamic terrorism for sometime now and this will work against him to some extent they will swiftly deport his ass or tweet about him to sushmajee and cc some deshbhakt handles twitter pe hi bahu chod degi public im kidding ofcoursedont do this this stuff is barood for twitter
india,removed,talk to your supervisor about it obviously
india,removed,this has to be a troll post right living in aus but coming to rindia for help
india,removed,dude the police there isnt as incompetent as it is in india when i studied there one of my colleagues at my internship was being harassed by a bengali guy she went to the police the same day and the situation was resolved the next day
india,removed,if he attacks you do not hit back just call the cops and put in an assault complaint he is an immigrant right his life can get pretty much ruined he will be begging you on his knees to take that complaint back within a day
india,removed,maybe you should try to flirt with his wifethat will piss him off
india,removed,we need one less walrus just one
india,removed,guy is playing your mind and you are all fucked see some doctor you need help
india,removed,best revenge seduce his wife
india,removed,i think a surgical strike may be necessary in this situation on a serious note if you value his friendship may be try to speak with him at a neutral place like a cafe or something and explain that political stuff should not affect your personal relationship if you dont then fuck him ignore him and pretend he does not exist if he starts shit strike him with a force that would throw him off his rockers
india,removed,i almost feel bad for aap workers they were in a position to make a real difference in indian politics for the better now they are all just samajwadi party playing caste and religion politics
india,removed,man to man talk tell him to cut it out my first experience wasnt good with a pakistani either i was shocked to see his behaviour but dont wanna talk more since all that bravado committed suicide in karachi ages ago rumours were his cop dad shot him
india,removed,who
india,removed,take him to the side and talk things out
india,removed,stay classy pakistanis ive met idiots like this before morons
india,removed,op please go to the police what are you waiting for for all intents and purposes he threatened you and your friend go to the police asap if you value your life he might be a troll but dont risk it never risk stuff like this ps dont fightargue with him unless absolutely necessary
india,removed,something similar happened to me in the uk the guy tried to convert me to islam when i was down in the dumps and when i asked him to knock it off he got aggressive collected the evidence and went to the cops asshole was thrown out of uni for other reasons too and the country tldr collect the evidence go to the cops guyll be begging you for forgiveness in no time
india,removed,twitter now lets people retweet themselves we should probably let ankit lal co know about this new feature
india,removed,come on mate he is kidding i usually see that happening all the time and its all part of the banter you yourself say that he laughs after he mock threatens you cant be serious the initial serious look is just part of the act chill the f out
india,removed,say this loudly pakistan tere tukde honge inshah allah inshah allah
india,removed,i think you might have borderline autism if he threatens you jokingly you can threaten back jokingly i guess this is just a joke he is playing on you for amusement of his im sure he is having a laugh with his wife in private about how you cowered and trembled at mere threat though youre in a stronger position same goes for pakistans attacks on india but thats for another discussion if he is threatening you seriously ask him back jokingly you dont mean that do you and then suddenly put on a serious face if he is really serious about his stupid threats which im sure mostly not unless he is an idiot or a psycho report it to relevant authorities and move on note this suggestion is based on my experience with people bullies take it with a pinch of salt
india,removed,here is geopolitical lesson in this context you know why nation statescounties have problem which seem unresolvable for long times but everyday people dont in relation to other people int he same country its because there are lawssystemsprocesses which supersede these people in a said country the people are not the highest authority they instead have a system above them this system atop a system atop a system dynamic goes all the way up in hierarchy to the nation state itself and then it stops there there in no authority above the sovereign nation state a state cant go to a higher authority complaining about issues it is having with another nation state because such a hypothetical higher authority doesnt exist no bodies like un are not those bodies these are akin to arbitration institution ie they exist at the whims of the nation states willingness to accept them and hence can not be termed as a higher body with laws and systems inside a country a person doesnt have such a choice there is no arbitration it heshes done something wrong they are getting the repercussions its not up to himher to not accept those repercussions so tldr take the advice other have said use the relevant authoritiesdepending upon the severity because you are not a nation state and neither is the person bothering you
india,removed,bro my family are hindu fijian we live in ewart st marrickville my family kill muslims all across fiji and my phone number is if you want help right now txt me my family are connected with the white gang bra boys who hate and kill muslims give me a ring asap my hindu brother
india,removed,you need to stand up to him and tell him off sternly if someone wants to fight you cowering down is the worst you can do dont be afraid man loudmouth assholes like him run away tail tucked bw their legs at the first sign of trouble
india,removed,second post as my first post was taken down i have sent you a private message bro my family are hindu fijian we live in ewart st marrickville sydney australia my family kill muslims all across fiji and my phone number is if you want help right now txt me my family are connected with the white gang bra boys who hate and kill muslims give me a ring asap my hindu brother my facebook is sumeetc the one with the israel flag any muslim and ram bhagwan will give you tthe strenght to kill them pm me before the muslims of india take this add down us fijians will give our life for our hindu brothers
india,removed,tell him
india,removed,but sort of threatens us and then laughs this is tricky are you sure hes being serious or pretending to be serious and threatening to scare you if hes serious why would he laugh at the end youre still in good terms with his wife ask her about this
india,removed,do surgical strikes
india,removed,it is difficult to assess and advise on the situation by words alone anyway heres my cents since you say you have known them for years do you think this guy might assume that now he is a personal friend and can push the limits of his humor because if he really wanted to do something he wouldnt be issuing constant threats which he might well know that it would get him into trouble right away before he is able to do anything maybe because of his wife being pregnant it might have triggered some dormant mental issue in him i would suggest before you take legal action it would be better to at least have a personal conversation with him and his wife and ask him why he keeps repeating his threats and that you do not appreciate such humor if he still says he is serious then there is no option but to stop all contact and immediately take legal action i have worked with pakistanis for many years and known them as friends just like indians they come in all varieties there are the ultraconservative nutjobs and the alcohol drinkers who dont pray not every pakistani is bat shit crazy and out there to get indians
india,removed,first thing to note do not confront him either in public or private it would be held against you in case of any future threats ask jokingly if he is serious or if he means it and do record if you can if it is a joke ignore it and please avoid giving an equally threatening response in addition if it were me i would stop socializing with this man and his family death threats are not a joking matter in case of any hint of aggression and seriousness in the response do not argue with him and as a first step report it to the relevant authorities in the university and file a complaint with the local police if needed after discussing with the university his wife being pregnant is their personal matter and doesnt concern you a threat to your and your friends life is a much bigger matter and a deranged man like him can cause harm to a much larger audience do provide an update

india,removed,worry about your safetynand peace of mind before thinking about his wife and baby bullying or threatening is a crime too and ffs stop meeting or hanging out
india,removed,tell him to stop doing it record the conversation on the phone and approach hr if he doesnt play ball with the recordings if hr are reluctant to do anything about it and you are seriously concerned about your safety approach the police that would be my suggestion

india,removed,this is why peta never opposes animal killing on bakraeid read what happened to the lady who opposed it while they are having a gala time attacking hindu cultures and traditions here is one rarest of rare moment of peta when they ventured to advise muslims to refrain from animal cruelty in a peta volunteer called benazir suraiya had appealed to her muslim kin folks to abstain from animal slaughter on eidaladha popularly known as bakra eid the festival involves the mass slaughter of cows buffaloes sheep goats camels etc in the most unscientific way as a part of sacrifice offered to allah dressed in a green hijab to highlight the importance of vegetarianism she walked towards the mosque gates with a couple of peta volunteers holding a placard in urdu and english which read make eid happy for all within no time local muslim crowd gathered and started chanting angry slogans against peta volunteers to vacate the place im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme

india,removed,this thread is like a toi comment section
india,removed,tbh hinduism is the most chill religion out there abrahmic religons specially islam was historically evolved to unite various warring tribe hence through centuries of modifications has become perfect in mind washing people christianity was reformed through the renaissance period but islam is seriously in need to get reformed

india,removed,no victims coming out doesnt mean there were no victims especially for rapes is this your justification for claiming rapes happened should i make some assumptions about you
india,removed,whats wrong with killing people this should shut tamilians up for a while and let them know they are stupid
india,removed,oh yes yuuuge oversight on my part
india,removed,its getting more and more difficult not to dislike tamilians by the day
india,removed,though tn has the safest cities for women coimbatore and chennai compared to sourcestats literacy rate is much much above national average national average tamil nadu is this much much for you httpsenwikipediaorgwikiindianstatesrankingbyliteracyrate
india,removed,there is a difference between much much better than national average and ranking among the states they are two different statistical measures
india,removed,its kind of racist as well since they decide that you are a foreigner by your skin color wrong a couple of months back they asked my sister was asked for her id at taj mahal i have been asked for an id at ajanta too citizens of saarc countries already pay less

india,removed,if periyar and others of the dravidan movement had their way there would have been a dravida nadu so your point isnt far off they wanted a dravidian pakistan the sentiment has been fanned from time to time and even today two small tn parties that heavily rely on the dalit votebank and proltte sentiments have a free tamil land as their ultimate goal
india,removed,is that why tamil actresses look like that because a lot of tamil cinema is funded by selfhating people as i said colonial masters nourished narratives and institutions that encouraged indians to hold our own indian history customs values beliefs and even our own skin in contempt slowly these narratives and memes of selfhatred were internalized by a lot of indians who became very successful materialistically under their masters benevolent gaze you are posting it in a language of people who ruled and looted us yes and your point is what oh if you use modern medicine does that mean youre supporting colonialism oh if you use a computer youre supporting colonialism ask yourself if your logic makes any sense foreign languages are just a tool i use to communicate with foreigners hindiurdu persian english and all those other persoeuropean family of languages are foreign languages to me they are just like a drill or a spoon or a pot is a tool just because a colonialist used that tool doesnt mean you should stop using that tool the joke is you would rather speak the language of oppressors huh i would prefer to speak tamil in case you lost your track english is not the language that some people trying to oppress tamil people are currently speaking

india,removed,the guy had apparently been using a voice modulating software to make him sound like a girl over phone the pictures he shared were all right out of some leaked nsfw album of an indian girl containing pics i truecallerd the phone number id been using to contact herhim and it showed a name the dude had told me was his own and he made his reddit account look like a womans because in his own words it was an interesting thought experiment and he found it more rewarding to be an anonymous girl than a guy on reddit lold way too hard i am sorry for what you went through but this shit is hilarious
india,removed,oh my god im so sorry man thats fucked and so meticulous there are indian women here so dont let that dissuade you but yeah if its been two months and no facebook then thats a major red flag again im so sorry
india,removed,the guy was actually a bot with ai and you were part of a social experiment this is the future where you wont need a companion welcome to the matrix op
india,removed,cool story bro
india,removed,i wonder if he fake she is reading your confession and im sure there would be girls pretending to be guys here 😂
india,removed,i am not sure where you are getting your statistics from all the rich gujju friends i know are worshipping lakshmi the first thing every morning if you mention the poor farmers then duhthey are snake worshippers to protect their crop from rats and if by poor you mean the poor dalits well then sorry to say it buddy they dont consider themselves as hindus so no question of worshipping lakshmi you really need to believe and follow through for eg look at all the saraswati poojas which bengalis do and then see how many phds they haveit all works out man
india,removed,
india,removed,lul xd
india,removed,ive observed this so much omegle the guys would pretend to be girls they will make them wait for hours for their imaginery boobs then they will demand them to complete their homeworkand finally they will come out as he
india,removed,now waiting for hisher side of story how i fooled a desperate guy who used reddit as tinder
india,removed,i truecallerd the phone number id been using to contact her why didnt you do it earlier
india,removed,i can onlylaugh sorry
india,removed,lmao that guy was one hell of a jerk for doing something like this i feel for you man such a tragedy i always have a rule of asking someone to make a particular symbol and post their picture you should do this in the future to be sure
india,removed,lmfaooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
india,removed,how can voice modulating software mimic a womans voice so well if so someone please suggest some software i wanna call my bosses wife and a couple of enemies wives and let them know how hot their cheating husbands are just think of the possibilities by using this software jokes aside i dont think voice modulating software can fool you for so long if you think a woman sounding like siri is normal to you then you got problems i think the woman is a woman albeit a married woman with kids she just loves mindfucking with young guys but she cut the cord when you tried to get closer easiest way just pretend to be a man social experiment or not spending fucking years on the web pretending to be a man is jerking it more than any man or transvestite would its way too much investment with zero return
india,removed,he found it more rewarding to be an anonymous girl than a guy on reddit in which way oo
india,removed,dude i think the girl wanted to avoid meeting you so she made up this being a man story i dont think any software will be able to convert voice in real time over phone
india,removed,psa be wary of strangers on the internet claiming to be anything and getting inside your head
india,removed,god youd have to be a really stupid version of sucker to not even have live webcammed with a girl before meeting her cant imagine you were so starved of female company that you fell for this
india,removed,you cry and delete your account similar to what people who shit their clothes do
india,removed,doxx is revealing a persons true identity on the internet for sinister purposes
india,removed,they arent going to simply ignore them and this is about the international community and its perception we can either try to influence it or just ignore it and be selfabsorbed pakistan doesnt there is a reason why historically the few times there has been a un vote or resolution regarding kashmir many countries have voted against us and weve needed the soviet union to veto them for us

india,removed,i make plans and call her up to confirm a certain hotel for three days you were planning to book a hotel without ever setting eyes on the woman or meeting her in real life lol thank your lucky stars this was some weirdo with a fetish and not a criminal gang good lesson learned move on with life

india,removed,smooth
india,removed,nobody jumped any gun and nobody said anything about him being a criminal
india,removed,i didnt reply to most of these comments because are just either trolls or mad patriots who wont listen to any other opinion anyway buddy here in pakistan the terrorist attacks have decreased does it mean there are no more terrorists nope but it does nean that the porper camps and training areas for terrorists which were set up since a decade were in fact wiped out during zarb e azb most are dead but obviously so many are in hiding and yet planning attacks which often do happen the meant that a negligible amount actually supports the actions of the terrorists and im more than sure that more people in india would want all pakis dead which is basically terrorism as well or more ppl in the us would want all races gone bla blahope u getting my point what amused me the most was indian media saying we crossed the border and killed terrorists like they were just sitting there i mean seriously xd and why the fuck would our army protect the terrorists like it is hard to explain here but the fact is indians are in fact more or as much delusional than a common paki rn switch between paki and indian media the truth lies somewhere in between buddy

india,removed,first that is what the whining victim is saying about them not saying shes lying but a slightly more neutral source like a police report or a court document or something would help second ianal and perhaps neither are you but it is not inconceivable that somebody might have called in a trespassing complaint happens all the time and it is not inconceivable that in some circumstances trespassing could be viewed as a criminal offence or a felony thirdly you dont know if the police used the exact criminal investigation words o the whining bitch is paraphrasing could very well be that they could have used felony or felony crime or just crime you dont know i dont know it is the job of the journalists to clarify these things but curiously when they have an agenda they tend to leave out nuance fourthly stops and searches like these whether legal or illegal happen all the time in the us and other countries around the world including india and anybody brown black white or yellow could be victims of this fifthly police doing a shitty job is not racism it is the police doing a shitty job thats all sixthly and most importantly this wouldnt be news if trump had not won the election and become president heck it didnt even happen under his watch of course the report doesnt say that it did but dont insult my intelligence by trying to pretend that this isnt an attempt at whipping up and fanning antitrump paranoia by httpsenwikipediaorgwikisuggestion

india,removed,it is ok to criticise the decision makers and persons of public interest it might even be tolerable to ridicule them in a satire to a certain extent but ridiculing the followers of somethingsomebody will only stop the discussion polarise the society more hit the nail on the head this is why i find this sub and the half baked liberals in it as polarizing as the government it criticises all the time people wonder how brexit happened how trump happened how bjp happened its because of the morons like this lot who are so convinced of their intellectual superiority that they refuse to engage in discussion and throw around terms like bhakt to anyone who disagrees and then wonder where the disagreements come from on polling day
india,removed,how did this article make it to the front pagelol
india,removed,demonetization doesnt affect most of the randians heck a lot of them are not even in india they have other frustration with the current govt which is being exhausted on demonetization my suggestion let them have their jizz fest because most of them are purely non sensical circlejerks who have nothing to do but bitch about the situation of the country
india,removed,bjp wasnt a national level player before nowhere did i say they werent in fact i implied the opposite when i ask if you are aware that there was a bjp before modi youre the one labelling all the randians as morons for thinking this is a right wing movement or whatever no im labelling them as morons for calling the other side bhakts and expecting them to engage in discussion which is why this sub is an echo chamber and a bubble right wing movement in the west is not comparable to the rise of bjp in india ok you have some serious comprehension issues so i will have to break this down for you a bit more i am not saying the are even remotely related i am saying that the liberals keep labelling these movements as right wing xenophobic extremist etc whatever without speaking to the supporters of these movements and just labelling them as idiots and then on polling day they pretend as if the apocalypse has occurred

india,removed,this is going to be a fucking disaster of monumental proportions the word catastrophe is thrown around a lot but i think if this plan is implemented that it would be actually catastrophic the indian government cant even build simple structures or roads well now imagine that type of shoddy work on the grandest of scales rerouting our rivers this is going to be the worlds shining example of indian at its finest or at its worst depends how you look at it if you are the contracting company that has won these lucrative river linking construction projects this is going to be a boon this project is going to cost well over billion usd how much of that is going to be skimmed and stolen from the construction companies that are doing the work look at the state of india its jugaad everywhere you look now they think we are going to trust them with our most precious natural resource our rivers how about no furthermore this is going to be an ecological disaster a river is not a pipeline that you can simply reroute for your own purposes there are complex ecosystems that have been around these rivers on their natural course for thousands of years you cant replace or buy all of the species that are going to go extinct as a result of this project im no treehugging hippy but you can see how incredibly damaging this would be to indias biodiversity not to mention the hundreds of thousands of indians that are going to be displaced by this project and become refugees sorry for the rant theres just so much wrong with this river linking bullshit it makes me so mad theyre going ahead with this

india,removed,when this issue first came up i posted thisall in all priyankamediauneducated people about this subject is just trying to stir controversy when you look at the bigger picture a church spokesperson told media persons that akhauri had broken ties with the church after her marriage to a hindu and she lived as a hindu one is automatically disowned by the church under such circumstances she could have rejoined the church while alive but once a person is dead we cannot accept the body for burial he added can we get a real source on that because the are only a few technical reasons why a apostolic christian churchcatholicorthodox would deny permission for a person to be buried in their cemetery and it definitely has nothing to do with if you went and married a muslimhinduatheist she was not buried at the church because she was not an official member of the churchthat is alleven if she had not paid her monthly subscription and had outstanding dues for decades she still has the right to be buried in church cemeterythis rule is in place so random people does not show up and say they want to be buried in the cemetery even if she had married a non christian as long as she kept her name on the list showed up once in or yearsshe would of had still been buried in the cemetery born mary john in st johns attamangalam parish in kumarakom near kottayam the elderly woman had always expressed a desire to be buried at the same church if she had expressed such an interest when she was alivethen her family members should of taken the time to ensure that she was an official member of the parish and all the necessary steps are in place for the burial to happen when she does pass we apostolic christian churchcatholicorthodox christians holds our cemeteries in extremely high regardit not just a place we bury the bodyit also a place where we connect with our forefatherswe hold remembrance services on a day of their death anniversary each year at their grave sitesevery sunday after holy mass will usually light a candle at their family members grave sitesin my church cemetery i have my past generations buried thereso does almost every else madhu jyotsana akhauri had died in mumbai on june aged she was a freedom fighter social activist and a former legislator on a final note thank you madam for you service and hard worksorry for the misunderstanding that occurred after your passingmay your soul rest in peacejai hind

india,removed,it is a perfectly fine argument against the lack of lasting benefits no its really isnt evidently the benefits are not lasting if the benefits are gone after just years i already explained this the so called benefits of infra development made when there is no global event hosting requirements and so on will still be gone after just years hence the previous argument isnt fine because using the same consistent logic implies we dont make infra at all under any circumstances because after all its gone after just years so why bother i already mentioned this hell why did you even bluff with lets ask someone that lives there if youre just gonna disregard their opinion when it doesnt fit your narrative a failsafe bet in case theyd say its all perfect now what is this firstly i didnt bluff second of all i have enough people in relation and friends from whom i know a fair bit its not first hand of course but i have an understanding which is diverse enough third its inherent to have more people speak on what i asked just because someone said its horrendous does that mean its only horrendous and that is it what sort of logic is that and there was no failsafe this is logic its common sense i dont need to write everything but often times i do which is why my comments are usually large because people have a tendency to assume stuff on internet when its not thorough and this is an example of that i should have written let people from delhi say something as if its not obvious that it requires more people to cast a judgment ill do that for you just now do you ever actually reach the conclusion that you were wrong of course never seen a single thread where you dont end up deciding left and right that nobody elses arguments are valid this is a classic case of selective confirmation bias it arises because you might have seen my comments on a few threads and then the bias takes over all the while disregarding all those other threads where i didnt not comment because in my mind i am not informed enough or bothered enough etcon those matters to comment since you seem to referencing my comment history i can fairly ask how many times have you seen me in a political thread or those relationship advice threads or investmenthard economicstax policy type threads religion threads apart from atheistic stuff and so on i dont because those are not my domain or where i feel comfortable with the subject matter things i am knowledgeable about i comment there and my writing style can be a bit abrasive at time but it dont feel i talk utter bs i back my argument with reason and whenever available with facts unfortunately i cant at the moment go through my history to list together all the moments where i was wrong

india,removed,with volunteers rss quietly makes its mark on bihar flood relief quietly and unobtrusively the ideological parent of the bjp the rashtriya swayamsewak sangh rss is making its mark among the bihar flood victims activists of six rss affiliates namely sewa bharati ganga samagrah vanvasi kalyan ashram bajrang dal akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad and vishwa hindu parishad have fanned out in the states floodhit districts to provide relief including food medicines and survival apparatus to the victims we are supplying them food packets and medicines every day said amarendra kumar singh of the rss who is in overall charge of relief operations senior bjp leader sushil modi said the government did not want any private agency or party to take credit for the relief work bihar minister for disaster management chandra shekhar hit back saying if private agencies were allowed in relief camps there would be anarchy here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,removed,you can hate rss and their ideology but you have to admit that they do a lot of charitable stuff they installed atlesst matkas in my town during the summers and someone refilled every pot every day
india,removed,india is lucky to have parties like bjp and organisations like rss
india,removed,but what about

india,removed,who else apart from kejriwal
india,removed,well as someone pointed out this is their version of being human this doesnt take away the kind of communal venom these guys spew as part of their ideology hafeez saeed also does charity still he is considered as a master perpetrator of terrorism hitler also did charity so did he massacred scores of jews i know im going to get a lot of ve votes for this but had to say this
india,removed,according to a report in the asian age february over quakehit people in kutch gujarat have decided not to accept government relief in protest against what they call the control over relief operations by fascist elements rss vhp and bajrang dalthe report quoted imran shaikh a kutch muslim as alleging that local relief workers asked him to chant jai shri ram in order to get reliefresidents of bhuj belonging to minority communities are being asked to chant jai swami narayan or jai shri ram by the rss and vhp cadres as they queue up for food in relief centres run by these organizations the rss and vhp cadres have set up relief camps in temples and largely hindudominated areas of the kutch they have ignored muslim populated areas like anjar
india,removed,volunteers working for flood relief is a big deal they must be doing something right they also did a lot for uttranchal flood relief come to think of it they are there providing relief during most natural disasters i dont see many other groups given hardcore support on the ground level when it is needed the most

india,removed,you can also show them this chart of economic decline of india thats whats funny about the vile british they love to pretend like the nazis were the bad guys in to the jews the nazis were the bad guys to the rest of the world the british were the bad guys most of the world would have preferred the british were destroyed rather than the nazis
india,removed,one exterminated continents full of peoples americasaustraliaetc invented concentration camps and wanted the triumph of the aryans im not sure about the nazis httpsenwikipediaorgwikisecondboerwarmediafilelizzievanzyljpg then as an mp he demanded a rolling programme of more conquests based on his belief that the aryan stock is bound to triumph

india,removed,if youre actually interested in history check out these links that explain in detail why churchill isnt like hitler or mao or stalin oh god another probritish self hating indians are you seriously linking to a probritish propaganda subreddit
india,removed,ah the usual attribution of false statements and logical fallacies by the selfhating and west loving randians
india,removed,chal joothe apno se pyaar nahi hai kya
india,removed,can you link the article that states they are richer and more educated i did not say they are more educated i said they are betteroff this is the httpfivethirtyeightcomfeaturesthemythologyoftrumpsworkingclasssupport it shows that trump voters earn significantly more than clintonbernie voters there are two problems with the atlantic article first it relies on a survey conducted only in nh the data is from states second you are misreading it it doesnt say that most trump voters didnt go to college instead it says that not going to college is the best predictor for trump support let me explain with an analogy suppose i made the claim that the best predictor of being a cricket fan is owning a cricket bat and helmet it does not mean that most cricket fans own cricket bats instead it means that among the various questions that you could ask someone to determine if they are cricket fan the question which if answered in the affirmative that is most likely to give you the correct answer is asking them if they won a cricket bat and helmet here is another rigorous about trump voters points to note yes they are less educated on average but they actually earn more despite earning more they strongly believe they are under significant financial pressure this applies even to those who earn they live in racially homogeneous ie whiteonly neighbourhoods they seem to be worried about their children more than themselves they seem to have health problems they are likely to be christian furthermore medicare and social security is not going to run out of money anyone who says that has no idea how the country works how taxes work or how anything in the world works i wont argue about this because i actually dont know how medicaresocial security works i am just repeating the claim the author rich benjamin makes the in the book hes a stanford phd so i still believe him more than you though no one will with altright ideologies will even win power simply because they are all uneducated racist hicks and are a minority even within usa most of the population and wealth in us is concentrated in major cities not whitopias furthermore most americans cannot related to country bumpkins i can only say you should read the book trump isnt winning the majority vote not because there isnt widespread support for racism but instead because hes made idiotic mistakes by alienating women and voters with college degrees a better candidate than trump will come along and not make these mistakes and will likely win
india,removed,we will have to wait and see how the results stack up during election time there is no chance of trump winning unless something really catastrophic happens between now and nov so effectively no chance imo so theres nothing to see in a way these statistics are consistent with primary results that the rich usually come to vote for them as stated in the article and research paper again youre misinterpreting things low voter turnout for poor people is true is across all parties and candidates the studies show that trump supporters are specifically richer than nontrump supporters even after adjusting for age college degrees and other demographic factors rich benjamin is indeed a doctor but do you know what his doctorate is in it is not in economics or finance its literature which means he cannot rightly make that statement with his expertise not trying to undermine him just letting you know that i cannot take his word for it without seeing actual data yes i know what his doctorate is in all i can say is that ive read his book and he has a strong grasp of facts and figures and i still stand by my statement that as a stanford phd he is wayy more likely to be right than a random redditor its nothing personal so dont take it wrong way
india,removed,altright is not a force it is a temporary distortion you see it in their ideological counterparts libertarians these are ideologies that have been tested and throw out if you break the ideology down bit by bit you will see the similarities with fascism and authoritarianism racial purity check women in homes check imperialism for trade check all done and thrown away fine well see you have your opinions and i have mine no i am not we still have to wait for the election results the author of those articles himself states that primaries are different from elections since only registered members can vote where do you live and are you following the elections at all pretty much all forecasters pec upshot pollyvote are predicting chance of hillary victory it is all over bar the shouting benjamin rich has an opinion that is not based on actual facts please go ahead an read the actual data and financial reports released by the social security fund also you should always be skeptical of someones opinion if it isnt backed up by experience and knowledge benjamin rich neither has the experience not the knowledge to make that statement and other the other hand you do have the experience and knowledge

india,removed,on one hand you claim that the evidence against afzal is not incontrevertible and on the other hand you take his own statements as factual evidence that he was only working as an informer believing he was helping the police etc so he claimed and so you believe there is a thing called reasonable doubt afzal was tortured by stf and sog his tortured dsp davinder singh admitted to torturing him he was being tortured by stf for a long time this is a fact now he says that he was forced to become their informer as a result of the torture problem is his claim was never investigated prosecution never bothered to prove his claims wrong and court did not give much credence to this which makes his trial faulty during trial phase when he was being chargesheeted he did not have a lawyer all evidence against him was accepted by his lawyer on the first day he came to represent afzal she never met afzal nor cross examined any witness in this crucial phase he did not have proper representation during appeal phase he had better lawyers but in an appeal you cannot introduce new evidence but can only argue on points of law plus the evidence against him was tampered with because of which court even censured the police for their shoddy work thus the real question is if there was reasonable doubt to claim that he was not really a key conspirator but merely a pawn in the larger game we rest our case you are inherently biased in this with your double standards as to what counts as evidence and to be believed we rest our case who is we here you should say that you rest your case you the most famous bjp shill currently active in rindia and the biggest sangh apologetic at the moment rest your case and i am supposed to be impressed by that to be honest i have observed you for a long time here and i seriously think that a conversation with you is a total waste of time because you lack the nuance to even understand the finer points of debate here for most rss members and sanghis like you the world is a very black and white place where indian armed forces can do nothing wrong and muslims specially those belonging to jk are all schroedingers terrorists a debate would be a waste of time for both of us

india,removed,effects of changing demographyall intolerance mongers and seclibs silent on this one though
india,removed,this is the problem with any area becoming majority muslim the mullahs and maulvis take over and try to establish the religious rule all over even moderate muslims are harrased all majority muslim countries sooner or later start gravitating towards fundamentalism turkey being the latest example one can blame the west and us conveniently but that doesnt change the fact that propensity to move in the orthodox direction lies within those societies in finanace there is a term called reversion to mean used to indicate that most markets and commodities sooner or later revert to there long term average values this applies here as well can we really blame the assamese being worried by the influx or are we really surprised when the separatists in kashmir are again resisting pandits coming back the silence of the civil society on such issues and also the kashmiri sepratists coming together to keep pandits out is dangerous
india,removed,this is the modus operandi of the religion of peace when muslims get into a majority the other religionsatheistsgays are subject to violence and cleansing
india,removed,sad but the reality is that if this was happening to muslim families it would have been aired in indian and bbc would have been printing article about indias crimes against minority
india,removed,india is staring a demographic challenge straight in the face believe it or not
india,removed,it happens because islam at its core is a political totalitarian doctrine that strives to eliminate anything and everything that doesnt conform to its way that seems really extreme can you tell me why you feel this way im sincerely curious

india,removed,how is he better than manmohan
india,removed,it is simple remove warning labels from products this will help kill off the idiots ask people who want to die for their country to do just that
india,removed,but even they are being replaced with englishonly boards increased globalisation perhaps maybe to accommodate nonhindi speakers the english boards are more prioritised the anglophiles you speak of are mythical creatures no one i repeat no one loves english more than their own mother tongue can translators not be used its just judiciary i dont care if they use chinese to do their work as long as its efficient why should it matter an esperanto made out of all indian languages is neat on paper but in reality its something that will never exist as most indians and by extension the politicians dont care indian have a chalta hai mentality not the japanese or chinese type of stern mentality the type of people demanding for hindi to be made the national language are the only type of people who care about a nonenglish lingua franca the common man simply doesnt care if it aint broke dont fix it and in the lazy indian context its more of if angrejee works why bother yaar the threetier linguistics teaching system of local lanugage kids have enough burden as it is we dont need to force them to learn languages would suffice and if they want to learn more languages they can always have the option to but it should not be compulsory oh so if we are not homogenous we should not be allowed to protect our languages no but we are more preoccupied with coexistence rather than bolstering our own ethnic identity like the japanese in fact excessive pride in ones own culturelanguage usually only leads to regional conflicts in india just look at how marathis beat biharis or how tamils are beaten in karnataka because of kaveri issue its all due to excessive jingoism where their pride reaches a point where every other indian language becomes an enemy to them so if we need to coexist peacefully we all must comprise in one way or the other and keep the kulcha pride at bay mister you entirely missed the point not really if there an esperanto indian language you may have a point but without anything english is the only thing linking all nonhindi states right now

india,removed,the army is not a selfserving entity from the moment a man enlists to the day he leaves or dies his life is in the hands of political masters from afspa to covert ops to full fledged wars the army has never in history taken unilateral action as such you and i the common men are responsible for putting the army in any position you criticise them of where is this line of argument coming from you need to enroll yourself to the nearest reading comprehension school asap all i said was that we should be grateful to the army but that we should also speak against the army if it indulges in wrongful activities for a guy who goes thinks brevity is sacrosanct you miss the very concise and precise point that i have been making all these time seriously are you willing missing the point because that would explain so much about why someone is unable to wrap his mind around such as simple line of thinking but knowing you youll probably just shirk the responsibility for that you dont know me at all i never made the point that we should not take responsibility we should take responsibility that is why i keep telling you that if we find our army indulging in wrongful activities we must tell them that we dont approve of what they are doing knowing you you are probably just itching to reply without countering any of the points which i made just to say that we are responsible for the army being in a bad situations and soldiers dying is terrible so we must not criticize jingoism or other such malarkey but if you at least want to have some sort of useful debate then please for the love of fuckin god in heaven reply to points and dont stray oh and not only can you not speak without blowing cool and cursing you blame it all on the other person just goes to show glad you saw something i dont care to know what it is though what grown ass man cant handle cussing on the internet stop crying like a little girl we are all adults here tempers are bound to flare when discussing such topics especially when one party completely refuses to see the other point and only responds with counter points when asked to do so a few posts later maybe you have i have no experience in that field is that is that suppose to be witty i mean am i suppose to go man he really got me with his wit this time pathetic i wasnt saying you are an experienced army whore just that you should suck on a generals dick that was an advice again a little brevity would go a long way okaaay fuck off you pretentious nationalist waste of a human being

india,removed,on mr walrus you underestimate your linkedin account
india,removed,strong valid arguments i dont think you realize that a huge chunk of posts threads get deleted because of randias political allegiance even if the said posts threads are of good quality
india,removed,from all the interviews that ive read i do think sonia and rahul act in good faith for the country they dont need to do this either they can stay away from the whole thing like priyanka and enjoy life but they dont they show up in parliament only to hear modi make some twobit joke about rahul being slow the point is this weve given modi a chance and hes doing a pretty good job before modi anyone you ask will tell you that bjp is the chorgundo ki party and congress is the educated and intellectuals peoples party then in the congress turned out to be a bigger chor than the chorgunde so we gave modi a chance this is how life is in india nothing is perfect you put congress in power they wont even dare do something like this they wont even dare doing whatever modi did against pakistan you put aap and well theyre just incompetent so who is left do you want to make a party and run myselfwalrus
india,removed,if fucking idiots cant keep themselves alive while standing in a line then good riddance the indian gene pool just got stronger god the pathetic whining and bitching from antieverything people is beyond annoying

india,removed,because for all the noise they make about free speech and intolerance historically it is the leftists who have always been the most intolerant and least free in the political history of the world their rhetoric has more value as propaganda than actual goals that is why aap and its supporters for example will keep screaming hoarse about bjp it cells and propaganda when their party has the best it cell in india
india,removed,the circle is now complete the rbi governor was literally booted off new man ushered in new man has nothing to say and is virtually in hiding doesnt speak a word and like clockwork the banks begin their write off thats an entire wall full of unfathomable ballooney but this specific bit should expose your bullshit agenda fairly easily

india,removed,you are arguing with a crank dont waste your time btw suggest some good books about modern military history post
india,removed,dead and terrorists killed i wonder if some sams cant find their way to baloch rebels now
india,removed,meanwhile check out the headline in the azadkashmir page and on rworldnews americans are trying to convince the world that these should not be labelled terrorist attacks as this derails the definition of terrorism frankly i cannot stand the racism on rworldnews
india,removed,allah duh

india,removed,cats mouse cows and walrus too
india,removed,kashmiris just want independence how chweet im sure theres an abandoned island in the pacific that they can migrate to and have their independence
india,removed,i think all this romanticization of war and taking revenge and sticking something to someones ass is mostly coming from the usas invasion of afghanistan and later iraq what you fail to realize is that both of those countries are not bordering usa neither of them had nukes and none of them had a much more powerful ally who also happen to be not so freindly towards usa if we even forget about all these and launch a full blown war against pakistan and hope they dont resort to mutual annihilation what good would come out of it first our soldiers would die fighting their soldiers than if we are able to capture the whole of pakistan we would need to deploy our soldiers there to keep that piece of land occupied there will be guerilla warfare similar to what now is happening if you are so keen on a solution try to read about isis and how it originated because of iraqs invasion so at the end of all this at best we would be just creating another terrorist group and would need to fight them on daily basis
india,removed,jnu waale aur shehla rashid calling it as an inside job to defame pakistan and islam because sharifs speech at un

india,removed,check out youtube some videos have the entire movie
india,removed,
india,removed,read it and was an utter waste of time you got only some of your facts right but draw completely wrong occlusions out of it mostly biased by your own ideology pakistan was attacking india in a much worse way before smiling buddha terrorism in jk and punjab was much much worse and even the terrorists in eastern states were gettng paki support just a few high profile terrorist attacks happened in new delhi and a couple of other cities after you posted a completely false post with partial truth and make up your own story just to suit your agenda whenever i start running a news outlet id consider hiring you journalists should learn from you on how to twist news
india,removed,most big ones like let ji jem and major factions of taliban are all controlled by paki govt and isi not even americans believe the stuff youve written
india,removed,because they didnt have any other choice and a lot of the americans still had the soviet hangover read up about what analysts like christine flair are saying now missions like osama and drone attacks which are being done without informing paki authorities they trusted them earlier and now are openly calling them enemies in their senate and press briefs
india,removed,what poll promise was compromised if i may ask he tried getting civilian govt to his side which failed as expected maybe he made a mistake or it was just a smoke screen no idea about that apart fom that he had specifically ordered strict response at border firings and it has been done firing by pakis on border has reduced to maybe once every months whereas it used to be a regular light and sound show previously pakistan has been systematically isolated from various centers of powers worldover do you think that it was done in last months sign that there is significant merit to this method there is merit if the country is not like pakistan

india,removed,my dishwasher is watching a saas bahu serial all day
india,removed,these people are fucing stupid modi bhakts they havent even taken high school economics much less college masters or phd level economics
india,removed,aap has changed the political landscape how how are other parties responsible for aap drama i think like most rabid aap supporters you have slective amnesia or just choose to ignore similar instances in other parties a lot of bjp politicians have been expelled for reasons such as objectionable remarks corruption and so on some quick examples being dyashankar aditya pandey jaswant singh bangaru laxman
india,removed,the indian army was on the verge of driving out the paki invaders when nehru stopped the armed action there were two theories behind nehrus decision nehru thought that he would win the nobel peace prize if he brought about a peaceful solution to the dispute through the united nations the other theory was that lord louis mountbatten who was the governorgeneral of both india and pakistan told nehru that two countries under him could not be at war with each other and the armed action had to stop unfortunately mountbatten had not the brains or guts to tell pakistan to withdraw from kashmir which had acceded to india

india,removed,once you construct a telecom network you dont have to pay for calls inside your network apart from running expenses telecom companies pay to other phone companies for outgoing calls from their network and get paid accordingly reliance will probably still get paid for incoming calls and recoup some of costs apart from that there are bandwidth providers as most telecom providers use leased fiber lines reliance has one of the biggest fiber networks in india and will get paid for voice traffic anyway from its leased line this is an educated guess about them recouping some costs on voice
india,removed,lol the kind of delusional idiots here is unbelievable they think foreign policy is a fight scene from amitabh bacchans coolie

india,removed,mostly the shia ones gujjar bakarwals paharis etc
india,removed,important points for crowd here secondly today if you go and eat in a hotel the bill that you get comes with this cess that cess people send messages on whatsapp detailing the bill amount and the cess paid all this will end and then we routinely see at octroi and border checkposts miles of vehicles standing when vehicles stand it hurts the countrys economy now all of it will become seamless the movement of goods from one state to another first of all in our country only what is talked about is seen as reform if it isnt talked about it isnt seen as reform it shows our ignorance actually i am of the view reform to transform i say in my government reform perform and transform and since i am sitting for an interview i would say reform perform transform and inform take ease of doing business our ranking is improving very quickly this is not possible without reform our systems processes forms were so complicated these have been reformed so our rankings are going up a un agency has said that from in the next two years we could be at number three these small things need to be improved even today there exists licence raj in some areas that needs to go this is an important reform that is happening at every level administrative governance legal like for instance we removed laws that were from the and centuries i have asked states also to do so these are very big reforms that people because of lack on information dont consider reforms first of all in our country only what is talked about is seen as reform if it isnt talked about it isnt seen as reform it shows our ignorance actually i am of the view reform to transform i say in my government reform perform and transform and since i am sitting for an interview i would say reform perform transform and inform take ease of doing business our ranking is improving very quickly this is not possible without reform our systems processes forms were so complicated these have been reformed so our rankings are going up a un agency has said that from in the next two years we could be at number three these small things need to be improved even today there exists licence raj in some areas that needs to go this is an important reform that is happening at every level administrative governance legal like for instance we removed laws that were from the and centuries i have asked states also to do so these are very big reforms that people because of lack on information dont consider reforms we have big malls in our country lakhs and crores of rupees are spent in constructing them there is no time restriction for them they can run till pm pm there will be a government representative with a stick in his hand and ask a small shopkeeper to shut his shopwhy we have said that these small traders who have small enterprises they are free to be open days that they can go about doing their business and also employ a few and these are the people who drive the economy in our country this is where we are working to empower its widely believed that high level corruption has come down drastically under your rule but low level corruption is still rampant how can you fix this pm modi im grateful to you that you have accepted that there is no highlevel corruption if the ganga is clean at gaumukh it will gradually become pure while flowing down you may have noticed that we have taken many steps which have neutralised chances of any corruption for instance we have shifted the gas subsidy system into the direct benefit scheme ghost clients who used to wrongly enjoy the benefits of gas subsidy are no longer there chandigarh was being supplied lakh litres of kerosene using technology we stopped providing kerosene to those houses which have gas connection and electricity and we provided gas connections to those who earlier didnt have thats how we made chandigarh kerosene free and saved lakh litres of kerosene from being sold in the black market the other day haryanas chief minister was telling me he is going to make eight districts kerosene free by this november you would know our farmers used to be desperate for urea and used to buy from black market black marketeers ruled in some states farmers buying urea from the black market were even lathicharged you must have noticed there is no news of urea shortfall these days no queuing up of farmers anywhere no lathicharge anywhere and black marketing has stopped why it is not happening anymore earlier the urea meant for farmers used to land up in chemical factories on the sly chemical factories used to process this as raw material and brought out finished products they used to get urea cheap chemical factories and middlemen enjoyed the cream we started neem coating of urea as a result even one gram of urea cannot be used by chemical factories and now entire urea is being used for cultivation only additionally we raised production of urea by lakh tonnes we are also neem coating imported urea not only that tribals in gujarat who were engaged to collect neem seeds for this purpose have started extracting neem oil while neem coating and have earned up to to crore rupees this is a winwin situation corruption and difficulties both gone likewise we can do away with low level corruption through policy decisions and using technology you will start liking at low level what you liked at top level as you know the position of prime minister is such that theres no question of liking or disliking lutyens delhi but theres is a need to deliberate on this in delhis power corridors theres an active group of people which is dedicated to only a few it could be because of their own reasons or personal gains its not a question of modi look back at history what happened with sardar patel this group presented sardar patel as a simple person from a village with a simple intellect look at what happened to morarji desai this same group never talked about his abilities achievements it always talked about what he drank what happened with deve gowda a farmers son became the pm yet they said he only sleeps and what happened with the supremely talented ambedkar who they are praising today they made fun of him what happened with chaudhury charan singh they again made fun of him so im not surprised when they make fun of him these custodians who are dedicated to a select few will never accept anyone who is linked to the roots of this country so i too do not want to waste my time addressing this group the welfare of the billion people is my biggest task and i will not lose anything if i do not associate myself with lutyens delhi its better if i live with the poor people of this country who are like me why interview politicians only there are so many others from other walks of life to interview during election time reporters start shooting from your bedroom and start asking about breakfast etc but not many know the sacrifices of our sportsmen instead of wasting time on politicians we should spend more time on our sportsmen how they control their food sleep how they still stay committed even after losing our youth must be shown those sacrifices i would like your channel to choose sportsmen from

india,removed,dont blame the governmentblame the peoplethey choose a shit lifestyle and choose an equally shit government becoz good governance means making people punish for littering with hard lasheswould you accept thatnobeen to dubai or any of the middle east you can see the cleanliness and great system because people there are afraid of getting their hands chopped off or getting their ass beaten up for any societal offence but you wouldnt like that becoz your not muslim countries or even european countriesyou follow hindusim the shittiest religion of alland the people who follow itoften litter every wherereal talkintrospect first before pointing fingers you all indians deserved to die like thisyou all dont need terrorists to threat youyou all are enough to kill your own surroundings and make your fellow citizens bear it with you the govt would simply sayjaisi public waisi govt
india,removed,i love me some boob get in touch bby
india,removed,punch in the face
india,removed,
india,removed,you wont believe what happened yesterday the thread was picked up by httpbeingindiancomentertainmenthumourindiancusswordsreddit and my college friend stumbled upon it so yesterday i get a msg from him saying sale tu reddit me mrunibrow ke naam se hai kya and there he identified me just because of the post i made there
india,removed,you forgot the gandhi family
india,removed,i dont give a fuckstop using me as a clickbait articlei have a job in america all benefitsim a rich nri now with good working visaso stfuop
india,removed,yep theyre rich already which is why the govt wants to make them richer go fuck yourself
india,removed,i really admire them when it comes to such issues they are like the perfect secretive org that no one can touch
india,removed,but all good things must come to an end httpiimgurcomjymmvsljpg
india,removed,still people berate me when i express glee at the prospect of crumbling british economy imo british people are the most savage race in this planet
india,removed,kya soch hai apki wah wah
india,removed,uvegpups that was not at all cool bro
india,removed,hours since the post was made and i am surprised certain terrorist sympatisers of rindia have yet grace the thread with their arguments on how indian army was at fault over kargil
india,removed,haram
india,removed,now let us deal with aurangzebs imposition ofthe jizya tax which had drawn severe criticism from many hindu historians it is true that jizya was lifted during the reign of akbar and jahangir and that aurangzeb later reinstated this before i delve into the subject of aurangzebs jizya tax or taxing the nonmuslims it is worthwhile to point out that jizya is nothing more than a war tax which was collected only from ablebodied young nonmuslim male citizens living in a muslim country who did not want to volunteer for the defense of the country that is no such tax was collected from nonmuslims who volunteered to defend the country this tax was not collected from women and neither from immature males nor from disabled or old male citizens for payment of such taxes it became incumbent upon the muslim government to protect the life property and wealth of its nonmuslim citizens if for any reason well how about we have a similar system now muslims cant serve in the armed forces cannot become heads of governments or states cannot propagate their religion and have to pay a protection tax in return they get all the benefits that the nonmuslims got during aurangazebs era as you have listed can we have a system like that
india,removed,yes the pakistanis on this sub want you to do exactly that
india,removed,eh who gives a fuck what mode of government those fuckers want but its quite clear that they dont want us there they consider anyone who dies in their effort to get us out of kashmir as a freedom fighter thats a fact whether we have a right to be there thats a different discussion personally id rather revoke article flood the place with indians and drive those fuckers to pok where they can rot to hell for all i care but since all of our politicians are for this appeasement policy i guess were screwed
india,removed,you do so by calling me i have no degree no experience and no clue about anything related but i can take a look and tell if something is off about it
india,removed,because the mediapoliticiansngos does not promotehighlight this info they also do not high light this info india spends on average rs per capita in kashmir over years while a up person gets only rs roughly of the states revenue comes from grant in aids which means roads hospitals schools etc are either built or maintained largely due to central funding compare that to what the average kashmirie gets in pok by the government of porkistan
india,removed,sonia madam
india,removed,i see nothing wrong with this
india,removed,americans loved globalisation as long as they were the most powerful country in the world and their companies captured all international markets and were sucking up the largest share of the worlds resources now that other countries like india and china have caught up they are suddenly having to compete with the entire world and with people who are willing to work harder for less whether they like it or not they need to get used to the new world
india,removed,i dont understand what is funny here
india,removed,this seems like run of the mill xenophobia to me most of the comments are coming from silicon valley which has a big indian population give some credit to americans they are quite toned down in their xenophobia many countries which are not immigrant societies would see much hateful rhetoric notice they are not complaining against chinese people even though plenty of new chinese immigrants are coming in why simply because asians have been in america much longer and they are used to them
india,removed,you are despised here you will always be despised in the united states while youre packing to go back to your shanty town in bangaluru and planning your next hindi flash dance party please tell the million of your fellow indian parasites who are clawing their way into the united states to stay in india theyre not welcome here butbut indians are racist too and then theres that guy in there complaining that indians dont socialise much with white people also working a job you were offered is completely amoral and indians should refuse usd jobs so that the american can get his ok somebody tell these people the world is every man for himself if youre going to miss rational thoughts with hate well then you deserve whats coming for you if they want to be a angry at anybody it should be their own bosses but of course since those are white people indians are scum for accepting jobs in an economy where its a mammoth task to find a good one
india,removed,this is why i can almost bet trump will be the president they hate us coz they anus

india,removed,this harami reporter is interviewing trump at a hindu republican coalition and asking what about muslims what will happen to hindus if muslims werent around this is the kind of slanted journalism that makes ndtv a mouthpiece of alleged in ndtv words secular parties
india,removed,worthless questions
india,removed,preschool kids use reddit now how the duck is this a til tomorrow til mohandas gandhi once did a long walk to dandi and made salt
india,removed,true as that may be its a bit hypocritical coming from the mouth of a pracharak whose chaddi gangs expertise is spreading terror and plausible deniability

india,removed,intruding into my business i am sorry but we are not a individual driven society its not so much about kulcha the rules come into play based on experience or collective experience ie people have been running brothel in a residential area till the neighbors realized and raised a complaint about it you may say it does not matter who lives in my neighbor none of my business thing for goodbad the society thinks it is ok for a male to be related to a female one can always go to a hotel
india,removed,looking at these journos acting like a bunch of hyenas pouncing on an animal i always thought they should be straightened up journalistic freedom doesnt mean you can push and shove mike and chase people like paparazzi these jokers cry assault on journalists but dont respect it of others

india,removed,words from the mouth of the horse matthew prince ceo of clouldflare and this was years ago the scale economics in our business are significant our primary variable cost is bandwidth however the rate at which bandwidth prices drop is very fast as you start to get to scale were now at the scale where we can peer off a significant portion of our traffic making it effectively free to us take it up with dot else stfu wow sorry i am not your wife but isps make their living off selling bandwidth to consumers and cloudflare is not a consumer infact airtel is consuming data from cloudflare consumer might consume an image times but airtel consumes that image from cloudflare only once thus having upstream bandwidth savings of n times where n is number of times a consumer accessed the image so what exactly is airtel selling here and finally i maintain that you are an ignorant ass

india,removed,there is jammu which doesnt want independence and then there is the shia minority which dont want it either now the sunni majority wants independence based on religious difference because right up until this point kashmir has its own constitution lives off of indian tax money so dont see what independence they are talking about on top of that hindus were ethnically cleansed so it was religion that played a more important role in kashmiriyat muslims of course cant have kashmir because after kashmir is lost they will start populating himachal or haryana or some other birder state and after a certain pop threshold will resort to same bahviour hindus kicked out more territory lost by hindus

india,removed,make sure your debit card is enabled for international transactions in the first place if not ask your bank about it you could also go with a credit card which i think should work but i am not so sure about this otherwise your best bet is to get an account in one of private banks and ask them for a international transaction enabled card i have read on various forums that axis bank cards work well with international online stuff same goes for icici banks
india,removed,then you really are better off with a private bank account with axis you need to keep minimum as a balance other banks would be in the similar range though some also have zero balance accounts but i assume they will be limited
india,removed,i would assume working days however dont hope for much the branches dont really have much idea about paypal and the likes its like when you say international they think international atm which obviously would work

india,removed,fuck yeah ajit doval for people who dont want to visit site he spent seven years undercover in pakistan recruited rebels as informants in disputed kashmir and once disguised himself as a rickshaw driver to infiltrate a militant group inside indias holiest sikh temple now some consider ajit doval the most powerful person in india after prime minister narendra modi modi picked doval as his national security advisor a position that holds more sway than the ministers of defense and foreign affairs it puts doval in charge of talks with archrival pakistan he visits arms manufacturers to discuss strategic capabilities and orchestrates the response to militant attacks liaising daily with foreign secretary s jaishankar the nations top diplomat since doval took the job he has supported a nationalist agenda while adopting a tougher line against hostile neighbors that has growing economic ramifications as china funds a billion trade corridor through pakistan that bypasses india and as both china and india eye resourcerich neighbors in central asia like afghanistan every strategic issue in this region involves security in a way that it doesnt in other regions says r k sawhney a former director general of military intelligence whos known doval for nearly two decades as the profile of the country grows the profile of the national security advisor grows short trim and bespectacled doval shuns the limelight and rarely appears in public his office said he wasnt available for an interview six people who have known him personally for years—some of whom requested not to be identified because he dislikes publicity—said doval is overseeing indias most delicate diplomatic issues shortly after taking office modi sent doval as his special envoy to afghanistan and brought him on his first foreign trip to bhutan hes also special representative in charge of talks with china over a disputed border a task made more difficult as china plans to invest millions into transportation links through kashmir an area claimed by both india and pakistan in december doval flew to bangkok for a secret meeting with his pakistani counterpart in an effort to restart peace talks between the two nucleararmed nations james bond hes known as an indian james bond—he has this larger than life persona said sadanand dhume a fellow at the american enterprise institute in washington there are tales and stories and legends attached to him that are very unusual in a national security advisor among the most famous concerns his part in the military operation that flushed sikh separatists from the golden temple in amritsar in northwestern india according to karan kharb a retired army officer who was one of the national security guard commandos involved doval posed as a rickshaw puller to gain entry to the temple he convinced the militants holed up inside he was a pakistani operative whod come to help them in their goal of establishing an independent country called khalistan indian commandos had stormed the temple twice in the previous four years including an assault in that left hundreds of soldiers and pilgrims dead prompting outrage among sikhs worldwide and triggering the assassination of thenprime minister indira gandhi who ordered the strike very innovative this time police had estimated there were no more than people inside the temple but doval revealed there were at least convincing the government to drop plans for a raid and instead cut off the water and electricity amid scorching heat according to kharb nine days later the militants surrendered generally in india people are very particular theyre sticklers to the rules said kharb doval sees the spirit in the rule thats where hes different hes very innovative and an outofthebox thinker dovals influence with modi has drawn criticism from opposition politicians and fueled discontent inside modis administration the country wants to know who is running foreign policy a spy called doval or diplomats tweeted ashutosh a leader from the antigraft aam aadmi party after modi flew to lahore to meet pakistan counterpart nawaz sharif in a surprise visit that local media said was orchestrated by doval the country is not safe with a spy running diplomacy calls for dovals replacement intensified after home minister rajnath singh suffered a politically embarrassing trip to pakistan in august that doval pulled out of at the last minute according to press reports a spokesman for the prime ministers office declined to answer questions about doval the best experts on how to deal with terrorism how to think about diplomacy and foreign affairs—they are not being consulted opposition politician rahul gandhi son of former prime minister rajiv gandhi said in january dovals job is strategy not tactics no government website carries dovals profile a biography provided during a lecture he gave in august in mumbai stated he was born in in garhwal in a northern region now called uttarakhand and graduated with a masters degree in economics from the university of agra in before joining the police force in he moved to the intelligence bureau where he spent three decades including stints in the restive regions of indias northeast jammu and kashmir and the uk doval is fluent in urdu the main language used in pakistan he told an audience in november he had lived in pakistan for seven years getting plastic surgery to remove signs his ears had been pierced—an indication of his hindu roots i havent seen anyone else at his level who would continue to come into the field said ss virk former director general of police in punjab who was shot during the golden temple operation and says doval visited him at the hospital he was an outstanding operator those who know him describe him as a heavy smoker with an almost insatiable thirst for knowledge taking guests at his home in noida near new delhi for drinks in a library in the basement lined from floor to ceiling with hundreds of books after retiring from the intelligence bureau doval founded the vivekananda international foundation in in its red sandstone and concrete headquarters in a tony district of delhi doval has courted foreign diplomats and highranking defense officials striking hawkish nationalist views that resonated with modis bharatiya janata party doval wields more influence than previous national security advisers in part because of his credibility and experience in intelligence and security matters said sameer patil who served in the prime ministers national security council secretariat under the previous congress government patil said it was long rumored that doval advised modi even before he was elected prime minister in in papers published during that time doval argued for a more assertive foreign policy and a beefed up military he warned of indias eroding maritime preeminence in the indian ocean of pakistans attempts to influence afghanistan and the taliban and said chinas development was not an assured peaceful rise india has a mindset that where it hits it punches below its weight he said at the august lecture we have to increase our weight and punch proportionately

india,removed,is that the only way to represent a hindu and your point being we should represent a hindu in anything but a brahmin are you nuts brahminism hasnt hijacked hinduism but rather slowly as time went on with invasions from the outside which slowly degraded the society inside india hinduism started to cling on to the brahmins take for instance the records of the islamic army commanders it takes happiness when hindus are killed but great pride when they insult the brahmins why so because as time went on as outside forces caused corrosion the hindu system started to hold on to something anything upon which it could stand the brahmins were the obvious case because they were the holders of the information they held all the knowledge about hindu society you lack knowledge on history dude today we have the chance to get out and so yes there is a problem of detaching hinduism from the brahmins but remind yourself of this braminisim didnt hijack hinduism hinduism rather begged to be saved when the last defense of bharata failed read the himalayas and you know who were the invaders are and how they treat the people you fucking survive on anything

india,removed,why would pakistani actors be needed to condemn terrorism when there is no official declaration that it was pakistan who attacked well if they can take a stand against a terror attack in paris they should be taking one against in india too especially kashmir uri attack doesnt help kashmir in the slightest it would only lengthen the asfpa and increase the army deployment how offensive is it to demand pakistani actors to be sorry for a terrorist attack like they are guilty or need to be absolved or something indians are offensive deal with it they are honest about their actions as representatives of pakistani culture they should be presenting model attitude to show solidarity with those killed and their families like they did in paris attacks that had no affect on them this over an attack which was not by the pakistani army there is no need to oppose pakistani army it is about terrorists pakistani army isnt involved they dont need to take stance against pakistani army just terrorists

india,removed,bro let people vent out their daily frustrations no point looking for logic here
india,removed,what problem i guess that statement does not specifically apply to you considering ur under congress payroll for you she maybe god for the rest of india at least those with half a brain she is a big problem in fact such a big problem that ur dear mms almost went to jail had he not lost the coal gate files what debacle devyani abused her maid in a country where even maids have rights she forgot she wasnt in india and she got screwed for it excellent i say you can keep ur eyes closed about the indias reaction to that incident against the us embassy and diplomats but neither me nor anybody else considers that as a diplomatic master stroke by mms as for your links wow your whole analysis of modis diplomacy is based on nepal and pakistan and a dumb blog that some modi hater wrote now i am wondering whether i should waste anymore time on trying to educate you
india,removed,fuck all of you indians kashmir belongs to us
india,removed,how provide proof before making baseless statements dont be butthurt just because your own ancestors where running around naked in the jungles
india,removed,lets not digress as i said in my original post there are many ideas for curtailing population growth my question was what are the disadvantages or problems associated with overpopulation with examples and data to back up those examples especially with relevance to india i dont think anyone has answered that question despite endless faffing around
india,removed,those are not problems of overpopulation but poverty however for arguments sake let us assume that they are caused by overpopulation so as indias population increases will you expect this problem to become more severe or less
india,removed,price of everything is getting higher because we are running out of resources really youll have to back that up with facts and figures and no absolute rupee amounts do not count we dont produce as much as we consume we havent been doing that for centuries again really data please
india,removed,did you consider that the chinese government might have got the wrong end of the stick
india,removed,
india,removed,yup if the us were to do such a thing they would have done it a long time ago
india,removed,why is a bot being downvoted
india,removed,you are trying to convince me i am wrong fair enough i actually want to be convinced that i am wrong and hence my post however you cannot convince me of my error by avoiding my questions
india,removed,however for arguments sake let us assume that they are caused by overpopulation so as indias population increases will you expect this problem to become more severe or less should be simple right
india,removed,good so if y decreases as x increases isnt the relationship an inverse one so to really decrease y we should dramatically increase x only in this case x is population and y is problems such as child malnutrition as an aside are you still in collegeuniversity
india,removed,behaya means shameless btw
india,removed,excellent i was not implying a causal relationship either now we have a situation where x and y are correlated without x causing y what i am interested is a contra example where x causes y ie increasing population causes something undesirable my point is we do not have any data which suggests that overpopulation causes something undesirable actually we have this data but for animals not humans especially not for humans in the current era all i am asking for is one example what are you studying economics
india,removed,so would you also agree that the chinese government was right on the great leap forward and the cultural revolution
india,removed,again you digress you may be right in all your above speculations but those are not what we are discussing we are on a quest to find out one unpleasantundesirable facet of life which increases with increasing population do you or anyone else have an example
india,removed,are you a retard chandragupta maurya was a bihari he overthrew the king and became a king himself his grandson ashoka said he was from magadha dont be so jealous south indian
india,removed,that sir is not an example it is speculation again and even the speculation is false and quite obviously so take me my parents had kids i grew up in the slums of mumbai they did not have many resources we have known hunger and want and deprivation and yet here i am living in london last year i cleared a quarter of a million usd one of my sisters is a ca another is a magistrate another is a teacher now in most of europe with england not the uk being a notable exception education from primary school to university and post grad level is free so is medical care even in england and if the parents are poor the state steps in to provide sustenance and housing so why should it be any different for india
india,removed,ahh the truth at last a bigoted eugenecist who considers poor people as untermemsch i wish youd tell me your real name and the university you are studying at i could get you thrown out
india,removed,i was pointing out that the chinese could have made a mistake and you refused to entertain the idea so i pointed out two other instances where they were actually wrong in fact if you consider communismsocialism as state policy that makes three are you guys really this obtuse
india,removed,i think kashmir should be given independence at the same time a plebiscite should be held in india asking hindus if they are willing to live with muslims if a majority say no all indian muslims should be deported to kashmir and kashmir should be made independent it should be free to join pakistan if it wanted any muslim who does not want to go to kashmir should be allowed to convert to hinduism jainism sikhism or buddhism

india,removed,im sorry you were robbed but id like to take a moment to discuss your wifes inferiority complex why exactly did she describe our entire race as servile is it because she thinks being married to a skinny bald white guy who couldnt defend himself against a couple of scrawny punks somehow makes her better than the rest of us your half breed kids arent welcome in our society just fyi good luck integrating them in slovenian society

india,removed,मोदी का विरोध क्यों ● क्या मोदी कोई विदेशी है जो बाहर से आकर प्रधानमंत्री की कुर्सी पर जबरदस्ती बैठ गए हैं ● क्या मोदी का चरित्र दागदार है ● क्या मोदी ने कोई भ्रष्टाचार किया है ● क्या मोदी अपनी तिजोरी भर रहे हैं नेहरूगांधी परिवार की तरह ● क्या मोदी का कोई बेटेभतीजेभाईभौजाई को लाभ देने में लगे हैं ● क्या मोदी की विश्वसनीयता संदेह के घेरे में है ● क्या मोदी राष्ट्रविरोधी कार्य कर रहे हैं ● क्या मोदी कामचोर है स्वयं से ये सवाल करने पर हर बार अंतर्मन जवाब देगा नहींनहीं तब मोदी से एलर्जी क्यों अल्पज्ञानी आरोप लगाते हैं कि राम मंदिर नहीं बनवाया धारा नहीं हटाया pdp से गठबंधन किया लाख नहीं दिये अच्छे दिन नहीं आए तो ये बताओ कि तुम्हें सभी विषय में नंबर मिले थे पहली नौकरी लगते ही घर खरीद लिया पांचवा तल्ला पहले बनाया या मजबूत नींव पहले बनाई पांचवा गियर पहले लगता है कि या पहला उदाहरण और भी जोड़ सकते हैं कोई नहीं बताता कि अगर मोदी नहीं तो कौन कौन बना सकता है स्थायी सरकार कौन बनवा सकता है राम मंदिर कौन हटवा सकता है धारा कौन करवा सकता है किसानों की सुरक्षा कौन कर सकता है भारत की रक्षा एक साजिश है लुटेरों की ताकि आप फंस जाएं और इनको लूटने को मिले मई से आज तक सारे चोर चुहार देशद्रोही आतंकी टाईप के लोग क्यों पगलाए हैं जरा सोचिए अगर आपने आज मोदी का साथ नहीं दिया तो जैसे वाजपेयी सरकार के जाने के बाद सोनिया की ग़ुलामी साल करनी पड़ी थी अबकी बार शायद साल से भी ज्यादा करनी पड़ेगी। खून के आँसू रोना पड़ेगा। सोचें हमने अपने देश की बागडोर मोदी जी जैसे एक ऐसे मजबूत और ताकतवर व्यक्ति के हाथ में दी है जो देश के करोड़ हिन्दुस्तानियों के भविष्य के बारे में घंटे सोचते हैं और उनके भविष्य को संवारने के लिए निरंतर कार्य कर रहे हैं। मीडिया और लोगों का विरोध सुन कर भी वो देश के भविष्य के लिए कार्य कर रहे हैं । अपने लिए नहीं हमारे भारत के स्वर्णिम भविष्य के लिए जी रहे हैं। गर्व करें कि आप मोदी समर्थक हैं कोई इटली की टीम के गुलाम नहीं या चीन का साथ देने वाले वामपंथी नहीं न ही अन्ना हजारे के साथ भारत माता की जय बोलकर सीएम बनने वाले और आज भारत माता की जय नहीं बोलने को जायज ठहराने वाले किसी के चेले नहीं। दस लोगों को शेयर करें दुष्प्रचार करने वालों को तो पैसा मिलता है देश से उनको कोई मतलब नहीं पर आप सुप्रचार करें आप सुप्रचार करें तो हमाराआपका देश सुरक्षित रहेगा और आनेवाली आपकी पीढियाँ एक जगद्गुरु भारत की संताने होंगी। 🙊जब देश का बंटवारा हुआ तब सरकार किसकी थी 🙊जब पाक अधिकृत कश्मीर बना तब सरकार किसकी थी 🙊जब मुंबई पर हमला हुआ तब सरकार किसकी थी 🙊जब चाइना ने जमींन हड़पी तब सरकार किसकी थी 🙊जब वीर सैनिकों के सर काट के पाकिस्तानी ले गए तब सरकार किसकी थी 🙊 बोफर्स का घोटाला हुआ

कीसकी थी 🙊भारतीय मुद्रा से सत्यमेव जयते हटाने वाली सरकार किसकी थी 🙊 वन्दे मातरम का अपमान किया वो सरकार किसकी थी 🙊 इंदिरा गाँधी के रास्ते में आने वाले लाल बहादुर शास्त्री की ताशकंद में रहस्यमय हालत में मौत हो गयी 🙊 नेहरु के लिए खतरा बन रहे श्यामा प्रशाद मुखर्जी और दीन दयाल उपाध्याय की हत्या कर दी गयी और पुलिस ने आज तक इस साजिश से पर्दा नहीं उठाया 🙊 राजीव गाँधी के लिए चुनौती बन रहे बीर बहादुर सिंह की पेरिस में मौत हो गयी जबकि उनको ह्रदय की कोई समस्या नही थी 🙊 सोनिया गाँधी के खिलाफ कांग्रेस अध्यक्ष का चुनाव लड़ने की दो लोगों ने हिम्मत की राजेश पाइलट और जितेन्द्र प्रशाद। राजेश पाइलट की कार को एक रहस्यमय ट्रक टक्कर मारकर गायब हो गया और जितेन्द्र प्रशाद बरेली के सर्किट हॉउस में मर गए 🙊 इसके पहले सोनिया को चुनौती देने वाले सीताराम केसरी को पार्टी से भगा दिया गया 🙊 राहुल गाँधी के लिए खतरा साबित हो रहे माधवराव सिंधिया एक प्लेन एक्सीडेंट में मारे गए जबकि उनका प्लेन ब्रांड न्यू था और उसमें कोई समस्या नहीं थी और किसी भी मौसम में उड़ने वाला सिस्टम लगा था। 🙊 काँग्रेस और विदेशी कम्पनियों के लिये खतरा बन चुके राजीव दीक्षित की मौत हो गई। राजीव भाई की मृत्यु की खबर किसी भी मीडिया चैनल ने नहीँ दिखाई। मित्रो जो भी इस परिवार अत्याचारों के खिलाफ आवाज उठाता है उसकी रहस्यमय हालात में मौत हो जाती है शशि थरूर की पत्नी भी इस बात का उदाहरण है। sirf padho mat share karo संविधान की धारा के तहत विद्यालयों में गीता रामायण पढ़ाना क्यों प्रतिबंधित है और मदरसों में कुरान और ईसाइयों को बाइबिल पढ़ाने की छूट हिन्दू मंदिरों और तीर्थ स्थानों के चढ़ावे पर सरकार का हक मस्जिदों और मजारों पर चढावे का पूरा हक उन्हीं का साथ ही सरकारी अनुदान बाबा अमरनाथ और कैलाश पर्वत की यात्रा पर सरकार को टैक्स लेकिन हज यात्रा पर

india,removed,its a multipronged problem i agree with the army man and i agree with the guys protesting in kashmir too this isnt the sort of problem where you can just take the words of the protesters as gospel oh the army is evil its terrible india is oppressing and neither is it a problem where you can take the words of the security forces as gospel either what is unfortunate is that this is turning into a race to the bottom who is worse protesters pelting stones at paramilitary military and police or these security forces dealing with a heavy handed way against unarmed indian civilians exercising their right to protest are the protesters bad for being violent is the army just defending itself has the army transgressed before have the civilians transgressed before it shouldnt be a race to the bottom it doesnt matter who is worse and who did what and who started what the only time that should matter is when youre thinking of what to do next why the fuck is there so much debate over all this whats the end game why isnt there focus on that theres absolutely nothing constructive happening or being proposed that im aware of apart from arnab making money off all this soapboxing

india,removed,the pakistan army is hardly a reliable source considering they actually have a history of lies and denials at the highest level for decadesbangladesh genocide actions of various dictators creating the taliban harbouring osama bin laden etc they are not going to take journalists to see any evidence that would prove them wrong ya this is exactly what i said in my earlier comment wapo nyt and others are unreliable as well since pakistan army would obviously not show them any proof and would have eliminated any evidence beforehand so let us wait for the official army video the ie article isnt unreliable its incomplete based on what access they had we can confirm that some attacks happened and there were some casualties but there is a lot more they cant see by their own admission and what i said was that since it is incomplete why link it because it does not give any evidence of surgical strike itself you are right based on ie reports we can say that some attacks happened and casualties took place in lashkar hideouts no evidence that indian army crossed loc eyewitnesses mention heavy firing but no one saw indian army as mentioned in the article this is what pakistan has been saying all along that there was heavy shelling and crossborder firing plus any person would point out that article itself says that based on whatever incomplete info i dont know how they got access to intel records as they claim they had little damage took place and casualties were far lesser than claimed by ia btw i am sure you are uhypocritesrule

india,removed,india has a rape problem but it isnt more or less rampant than most countries in the world according to statistics at least
india,removed,you are way too cynical i choose to be optimistic in life i would like to say two things doesnt have a rape culture and our culture definitely dont condone rape talk about cops and courts being useless you do know that india has a much higher conviction rate for rapes than most of the developed countries right people are regularly punished for raping if you want more statistics and data ill gladly provide them
india,removed,since you are not aware about the rape statistics i would like to share this brilliant comment by udalermehndii that he wrote on rworldnews in an article related to rape in india i hope this will make you believe that india doesnt have any rape culture here we go before you all get on the india hatred train say that india has a rape culture and start labeling all of us as rapists read this ive written this in the context of usa but it applies to most western countries fact media reporting standards are not the same indias media reports things differently from media in other parts of the world media reports in various parts of the world have themes american media focus a lot on race issues middle east media focuses a lot on sectarian issues indian media focuses a lot on gender issues it would be faulty to not recognize the themes and blindly use media as a barometer crimes get a disproportionate share of indias media reporting top news sources in the us dont report rapes in the way india does for instance women in the us were rapedassaulted in the time i took to write this comment about mins you wouldnt likely read about any of these cases in the media when a woman was sexually assaulted in an uber taxi in delhi it became a major news and the government quickly reacted but such crimes involving uber is fairly routine in the us sources httpwwwwhosdrivingyouorgrideshareincidentshtmlsexualassaults in the us and europe such rape stories would come in local media and just move out of national attention you probably didnt even come across it us local governments didnt pursue uber with the same vigor indian media selectively picks up a case and rallies around that this creates a distorted reality the sad truth is that it is not india vs us it is that women get raped and it doesnt become a big news see this as a global problem fact indias rape rate is not the highest in the world not even close according to the un data on rape the rapes per people in india is and in usa going by these statistics rape rate in usa is a whopping of india so much for the rape culture in india sources httpsenwikipediaorgwikirapestatistics httpwwwnationmastercomcountryinfostatscrimerapespercapita if you dont like the statistics construct better ones figure out what factor you want to measure that is not covered in the reports from world bodies construct scientifically accepted surveys get to the root of the problem with logic use your stuff between the ears instead of passing judgements with hot gas under reporting of rapes now i know the next thing youll say is that rapes are under reported in india and its true but the matter of fact is that rapes are under reported everywhere in the world including usa more than of rapes go under reported in usa sources now for the sake of argument lets give you the benefit of doubt and assume that only of the rapes in india are reported and cases go unreported also assume that of rapes in usa are reported by that logic the real rape rate in india will be x now let us go further and double that too we get x which is still way less than the rape rate in usa therefore even if you multiply the rape rate of india by it still doesnt matches usa this proves that india is a much safer country for women compared to usa in cultures across the world rape carries a stigma because most of the rapes happen with people who are close to the woman thus there is a strong social pressure against reporting this basic fact is lost on the many who are giving their uneducated comments on the issue the number of recorded rapes in india is certainly a substantial underestimate but even if we take five times—or ten times—that figure the corrected and enlarged estimates of rapes would still be substantially lower in india than in the us the uk sweden or south africa even with the assumption that there is no underreporting in these other countries nobel laureate amartya sen do you want to discuss rapes or engage in stereotypes here is a simple question for those want to discuss this issue are you interested in creating solutions for making women safe across race creed class and country do you want to pick up some news item to justify your own stereotypes about a country if you belong to the former group let us constructively engage in a debate on the solutions if you belong to the latter group you are not the solution but the problem in summary this is plainly a media distortion where one country reports rapes with more vigor than an another country this leads to blind stereotyping that destroys peoples lives careers for no fault of their own instead of getting into such faulty stereotyping without any statistical evidence let us as humans figure out ways we can make world safer for women because they are getting raped all over the world at an alarming rate you still believe india has a rape culture and that usa is a very safe country for women edit below even more data rape data on india reported rapes a based on united nations office on drugs and crime unodc data from reported rapes in india or reported rapes for every women this places india at out of countries this video discusses the above statistics rapes are overhyped in india also see this unreported rapes b based on a survey conducted by un women india reported rapes for every women over their lifetimes based on the answers they gave householdlevel surveyors the question if the women had experienced sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner or any other person placed india at out of countries ten per cent of women in india reported having experienced sexual violence by their husbands during their lifetime in the un women database this places india at out of countries with comparable data source rape conviction rate according to the guardian just of reported rapes in the uk resulted in convictions during in sweden the conviction rate is as low as france had a conviction rate of in poor india a developing nation with countless challenges managed an impressive conviction rate in thats thanks to the efforts of a lot of good people — police lawyers victims and their families — working heroically with limited resources source why rape seems worse in india than everywhere else but actually isnt archive link

india,not_removed,during discussions of the state and its identity an often forgotten part is the tulu language commonly spoken in the coastal belt a region that has a distinct language culture and history from the rest of the state heres a brief overview of the language and the region amaa tulu history the oldest available inscriptions in tulu are from the period between to century ad these inscriptions are in the tigalari script and are found in areas in and around barkur which was the capital of tulu nadu during the vijayanagar period this dating of tulu is also based on the fact that region where tulu is natively spoken was known to the ancient tamils as tulu nadu and the tamil poet mamular who belongs to the sangam age ad describes tulu nadu and its dancing beauties in one of his poems in the halmidi inscriptions one finds mention of the tulu country as the kingdom of the alupas the region was also known to the greeks of the century as tolokoyra the history of tulu would not be complete without the mention of the charition mime a greek play belonging to century bc the plays plot centers around coastal karnataka where tulu is mainly spoken the play is mostly in greek but the indian characters in the play are seen speaking a language different from greek debatably prototulu or another protodravidian language language all contemporary works and literature are written in the kannada script historically brahmins of tulu nadu and havyaka brahmins used the tigalari script to write vedas and other sanskrit works the tigalari script is descended from the brahmi through the grantha script and is a sister script of malayalam although a lot of people mistake tulu tobe a dialect it isnt one tulu is mutually unintelligible with any other dravidian language in fact tulu language has four dialects which are broadly similar with slight variations the earliest available tulu literature that survives to this date is the tulu translation of the great sanskrit epic of mahabharata called mahabharatoಮಹಾಭಾರತೊ it was written by ad a poet who lived in kodavur near udupi around late to early century ad bhuta kola nagaradhane and yakshagana a httpsenwikipediaorgwikibutakola is typically an annual ritual performance where local spirits or deities būtas daivas are being impersonated by ritual specialists from certain scheduled castes the būta cult is prevalent among the nonbrahmin tuḷu speaking castes in tulu nadu the ritual performance at a būta kōla or daiva nēma involves music dance recital and elaborate costumes recitals in old tulu recount the origins of the deity and tell the story of how it came to the present location httpsenwikipediaorgwikinagaradhane is a form of snake worship with two distinct rituals performed in reverence to the snake aashleshabali and nagamandala of these nagamandala is the longer and more colourful of the two nagamandala depicts the divine union of male and female snakes it is generally performed by two priests the first priest called patri inhales the areca flower and becomes the male snake the second priest called nagakannika or the female snake dances and swings around an elaborate serpent design drawn with natural colours on the sacred ground the ritual is supplemented by playing an hour glass shaped instrument called as dakke the drawings in five different colours on the sacred ground are white white mud red mix of lime powder and turmeric powder green green leaves powder yellow turmeric powder and black roasted and powdered paddy husk aashleshabali is similar nature to the after death rituals performed for the humans as per the hindu tradition httpsenwikipediaorgwikiyakshagana is a folk theater form that combines dance music dialogue costume makeup and stage techniques with a unique style and form a typical yakshagana performance consists of background music played by a group of musicians known as the himmela and a dance and dialog group known as the mummela who together enact poetic epics onstage a yakshagana performance typically begins in the twilight hours with an initial beating of the drums of several fixed compositions called abbara or peetike this may last for up to an hour before the actors finally arrive on the stage the complete performance usually lasts overnight ending around sunrise will update this answer when i have more time sources mass copying from various sources because this is not a dissertation
india,not_removed,karnataka is by far one of the most liberal states in the union that said i can see that friction between natives and outsiders is increasing lately the major reason for such development is the apathetic attitude of the immigrants towards learning kannada if you have stayed in the state for years and still cant speak rudimentary kannada its only natural that the native kannadigas would be disappointed with you a small anecdote just to let you know the depth of the problem a colleague of mine who stayed in bangalore for five years couldnt speak a sentence in kannada to save his life and then when he had gotten one month onsite opportunitygermany he joined goethe institute to learn deutsch i feel dejected when i realise that kannadigas are forced to become more and more conservative these days as a result of the fact that their accommodating nature has been taken for granted by the incoming migrants

india,not_removed,im so proud of my state karnataka
india,not_removed,if anyone is interested in knowing about north karnataka had typed it in the wrong place the dry area comprising of north karnataka telangana marathas vidarbha etc has remained backward this is mainly because of the dry weather soil conditions and general apathy from the governments the area was known for the saints it produced during the bhakti sufi movement basaveshwara akka mahadevi sant shishunala shaeefa khaaja bande nawaz are a few well known ones most of them were antiestablishment there were also pontiffs and seers like madhwacharya raghavendra swami and teekarayaru who were from the classical philosophies the area produced sects like veerashaivas and lingayats we had the badamis who ruled from bagalkot adil shahi bahamani who ruled from bidar and gulbarga respectively we also have forts in bijapur and raichur which are in ruins nowso it has a rich spiritual and cultural heritage the nizam of hyderabad and later the goi is said to have looted away most of the wealth from the smaller kingdoms after independence most of the efforts made to try to industrialize these areas have failed they have become subsidy leeching parks for relatives of our beloved politicians even the it parks are turning out to be in a similar rut anyone hardly shows any profit there most of the wealth in the area used to be either from corruption graft or the feudal land lords after the land ceiling act tenency act etc that has changed and those families have largely moved to cities and gotten education there are now a large number of engineering and medicaldental colleges there that can be traced to politicians currently you will see a lot of families with children outside the country remitting money back home there are a few money laundering businesses that get remittances from the gulf too source family of bankers knows where to get deposits from these factors have lead to land prices going up most people who dont get to live the best lifestyles in bangalore or hyderabad end up settling back in their hometowns driving further demand overall the people in north karnataka are moving towards education and development faster than their counterparts in other states i almost forgot to mention the delicous cuisines of the area but that is a very deep and wide topic in itself

india,not_removed,yes i do see a lot people who have been here for a decade or so and still cant speak a single line of kannada
india,not_removed,a colleague of mine who stayed in bangalore for five years couldnt speak a sentence in kannada to save his life and then when he had gotten one month onsite opportunitygermany he joined goethe institute to learn deutsch this i see this happening so often its amusing oh im going to germany for a few months i better learn some german forgetting the fact that almost everyone can understand basic english in germany which isnt so in india and the funny thing is the reluctance to learn the local language is more common among the professionaloffice going folk while manual labourers from states like biharwbodisha tend to pick up basics of the local language within a year or two
india,not_removed,i hope you know tulu and konkani too i feel their accommodating nature has been misused to stamp kannada over them too btw respecting local culture is different from knowing the language get over lingual chauvinism

india,not_removed,nice i think kannada literary works show how ahead of time they were when compared other languages and kind of response they got in that time i dont think anyone can write another ಸಂಸ್ಕಾರ samskara without offending or getting banned now days no nitpicking just an example i have red the novel and come from same community that novel just works on so many levels
india,not_removed,good work man
india,not_removed,you forgot httpsenwikipediaorgwikigprajarathnam

india,not_removed,congos
india,not_removed,im proud to live in a country with so much diversity but still unity go on a trip and youll learn a lot about different cultures
india,not_removed,part of the reason for the underdeveloped state on north karnataka might be the fact that there are no capital cities in the vicinity from where i stay bangalore is kms hyderabad is mumbai is this in my opinion hampers the growth of the region in a big way no capital city no influential politicians no investments attracted no growth examples for what happens when there are influential politicians kharge almost single handedly transformed gulbarga city mb patil water minister i guess under congress government brought in the kere neeru tumbuva yojane lakes filling scheme to bijapur newer lakes renovation of older lakes and a network of accompanying canals has hugely impacted bijapur not to forget the ancillary industries that get the boost because of having a capital city north karnataka despite being a significant portion of karnataka gets almost zero representation in the film industry thus i call for a separate state for the districts north of and including bellary koppala gadag and dharwad a separate state should not necessarily mean a hatred towards the rest of the districts the kannada sentiment is high in the northern districts as well
india,not_removed,sravanabelagola just to add sravanabelagola goes way past chandragupta maurya retired there as a monk in century bc where he eventually died
india,not_removed,yes those are the western ghats you talking about
india,not_removed,happens with most places around the globe
india,not_removed,basically bjp aligned with the most populous and important community lingayats jds were the default lingayat party after but kumaranna fucked it up and yeddy emerged as the undisputed leader
india,not_removed,unlike tamil nadu and kerala lack of rational and atheistic movements to counter brahminical idealogies which uses the society as their foot soldiers to implement their diet lifestyle and be bosses for them only in india you can find the same section of people who created idols and construct temple to be kicked off garba sannidhi else get lynched if they dare come close to the area meant for the upper class in the very temple they built such is the power of brainwashing from childhood no wonder people dont question why only the upper class who are less than people get to always be the head of rss and hold all influential positions in the country be it politics or business
india,not_removed,so more konkanis in karnataka goa or maharashtra also have noticed that all high profile konkanis are from mangalore and are cfos any reason
india,not_removed,how different is the konkani spoken in mangalore and the dialect spoken in goa
india,not_removed,why dont these kannads learn hindi soon s
india,not_removed,well a person just posted a photo of a sign board which clearly said to learn kannada or fuck off stereotypes happen for a reason
india,not_removed,agreed bangaloreans are based as fuck edit lmao idiots who dont know based means best
india,not_removed,bmtc service to almost any part of the city and probably the best city transport of the major cities
india,not_removed,i can relate to your feelings towards kannada and karnataka since even i am a kannadiga born and brought up in tamil nadu my family has been in tami nadu for more than generations now i live in bangalore and i am very hesitant to speak in kannada that i know since people always end up asking tamil ah
india,not_removed,should have picked a better role model
india,not_removed,there are quite a lot of cultural and linguistic differences between the north and south karnataka prominently the language is quite different sounding in northern karnataka when it comes to both vocabulary as well as the accent i might be wrong but i think the differences could have been because the northern regions were not under the same kingdoms that ruled the places around bangalore the north western was under maratha kingdom ie called as mumbai karnataka and the north eastern was under the nizams called as hyderabad karnataka wrt demands for a separate state they do come up once a while when the northerners feel that they are being overlooked when it comes to development projects educational institutions etc but they die down quickly as well
india,not_removed,the demand is because there is no real job growth in the area and the only jobs people are fighting for are government jobs the distance from the state capital is another factor there is also widespread corruption and mismanagement of government funds otherwise people are not drastically different karnataka has a healthy mix of various subcultures that coexist
india,not_removed,we in delhi dont know much about the north eastern states either
india,not_removed,there is not much difference in the idlis per se its the sambhar and chutney that differ regions like shimoga karwar udupi make use of a lot of coconut and you can readily make out the difference between them and a non malnadhilly ones i personally do not like tamilian masalas chutneysambhar in hyderabad was very spicy and there was more of masalas and less of veggies masala paddu is a must try dish its not that popular but its awesome
india,not_removed,thanks borat bhat
india,not_removed,those who get it from the internet
india,not_removed,wew i actually didnt know that a subreddit was made for that d
india,not_removed,haanvai 😃
india,not_removed,its tough to learn without a kannadiga friend one of my north friends has learnt to speak very well in a couple of years by just asking meanings for various words you need to speak it to learn it it would apply to any language really
india,not_removed,try sites like urban pro itll have teachers wholl teach you online
india,not_removed,normally i am against stocking bills on walls but this poster deserved to be covered by bills and stickers
india,not_removed,if you visit tumkur make sure you go to jamuna bar sit in the shady section and have the chicken sathiya once you get your order dont look at it and tell the waiter oh chicken satay hell slap you
india,not_removed,i think people generally just thought of him as a dacoit until he kidnapped rajkumar then a lot of people started to really dislike him
india,not_removed,we dont have a pro ltte and pro bandit politician like seeman or vaiko here so a bandit is just a bandit
india,not_removed,kannada name is neelakhanta meaning blue throat absolutely gorgeous bird
india,not_removed,these are some of the places i am listing out coorgkodagu chickamagaluru agumbe sakleshpur
india,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikischwadeletioninindoaryanlanguages
india,not_removed,randians are aware that it is kannada kannad is delibaretly used in this forum when language arguments take place since it instigates kannadigas it is used like a tease
india,not_removed,no north india actually cares about your silly dravidian languages no offence
india,not_removed,north karnataka food is more simplistic lots of bajra and jowar rotis with yummy brinjal curry and pulses in southern karnataka ragi mudde balls are eaten with naati chicken wild curry coorgkodagu is known for amazing pork there are a bunch of preparations along with other non veg stuff mangalore is on the coast the cuisine sort of resembles kerala cuisine in using lots of sea food and coconuts in their recipes and of course you have the varieties of dosas like davangere butter masale cant help with recipes though but this should help as a starting point
india,not_removed,karavalli cuisine is relatively unknown and its kickass try anjal in any coastal restaurants pandi curry from kodagu is good there used to be a restaurant in koramangala serving kodava delicacies not sure now bhakri from hublidharwad is a really nice preparation a salad of cooked dal super tasty
india,not_removed,the two i know are mysore masala dosa and bisi bella baath
india,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiudupicuisine probably doesnt need much introduction it has become wellknown throughout india mangalore where im from is big on seafood youll have to go there to try it though because it hasnt yet caught on in the rest of the country
india,not_removed,western ghats region in karnataka is called as malenadu here is the link to authentic malenadu recipes enjoy
india,not_removed,to add to the list tumkur tatte idli is very famous and really very good and it will be better than idlis that you eat else where
india,not_removed,maddur vade
india,not_removed,gujju here form my experience of living in belgaum i can say davangiri dosa bhadang and uppid are best
india,not_removed,there are people in our country who like salman khan puneeth rajkumar is way better than him and his movies are watchable
india,not_removed,his movies are actually not bad he did a good job hosting kbc as well that said im indifferent to him but im not surprised if people like him hes ugly so what
india,not_removed,recent movies arent that good there were days when he had pretty decent movies
india,not_removed,his movies are good man he dances well his action stunts are amazingly realistic i recommend a movie called jackie this movie came out around the same time as murder this movie too was themed around human trafficking and i liked this better solid visuals music stunts dialogues and directed by suri i by far think this is his best movie please do watch edit he is ugly as fuck though he was cute when he was a child actor
india,not_removed,well there is this
india,not_removed,we all have our own cross to bear
india,not_removed,for his acting
india,not_removed,still cant find any place where you can get a good masala chat than inside karnataka
india,not_removed,and how mysore and mahisasur mythologically connected his abode
india,not_removed,so speed breakers on a highway whole state is incompetent there are many things karnataka does well such as the ksrtc bus service probably indias best
india,not_removed,traffic signals on a goddamn state highway plizz bangalore had traffic signal on a particular flyover till few years ago probably the only country in the world to think of something like this
india,not_removed,lol i knew kannadigas would be butthurt the moment you point out their govts incompetence it truly is the up of south india

india,not_removed,its ullar not hullar idk if you didnt mean for the h to be pronounced though
india,not_removed,i might get lot of hate for this but i think it is helping bangalore a lot because people from all across india can come here and feels like home if they know english which is pretty difficult in other metros until unless you are pretty rich and your circles are different i have lived my childhood in utrakhand and up and had ability to learn language i went to pune and my whole circle was marathi people i was atleast able to understand the language in months but in bangalore my circle consist of people from all across india and kanadda people are only a small part of it only daily activity where i face difficulty in communication is shopkeepers which big basket has solved now i just dont have any need to learn a new language we all are in this rat race and will do things based on necessity only i am not being asshole but just want you to understand that learning kanadda will not help me much in my life and thats why it is a low priority thing for me may be when i retire and decide to settle in some small town near by then i have to learn it
india,not_removed,smart germans make nongermans learn their language while poor kannadigas get coldshouldered for being welcoming and tolerant

india,not_removed,the rss and the right wing hindutva groups has been a toxic influence there the bjp got wiped out of udupi mangalore area in the elections owing to those pub and homestay attacks things have gotten a little better in the last two years that being said mangalore otherwise is one of the more liberal cities in india i think the city will resist the hindutva experiments of the bjp and come back stronger
india,not_removed,late at night when i looked at this comment i felt the author poornachandra tejaswi replied to me ps may be you are i would never know
india,not_removed,thank you i just wrote who all i could recollect then will add this
india,not_removed,many works of ur ananthamurthy are also translated pick from also girish karnads his famous work translated to english try yayati if you like plays since it was translated by the author himself he studied philosophy politics and economics at lincoln and magdalen colleges in oxford and initially aspired to become an english poet edit karvalo is marathi version sorry
india,not_removed,reminds me of song
india,not_removed,at least nanna state thread nalli aadru ee thara comment haakakke bidu dont bring india and blah blah im least concerned about it
india,not_removed,small correction kharge did nothing big compared to the influence he had i remember the main roads being dug up for close to years when we had ministers from nk in dharam singhs cabinet they just sat through their term today he talks like he represents the entire south india one of the main reasons for the backwardness is that this is a congress stronghold area among the other regions that i mentioned the only change that you notice is in telangana because they kicked out congress entirely the u turn of hyderabad also happened during chandrababu naidus term

india,not_removed,yeah these characteristics can be seen in parts of kerala also
india,not_removed,also adding to this the support of reddy brothers helped the party ps for every vote they gave during elections in bellary city
india,not_removed,ok but not just tn and kerala even andhra pradesh has been mostly free from the influence of rss besides rational and antibrahminism movements were pretty strong in maharashtra and telengana too before the but both have been largely influenced by hindutva i think it is more complex than that
india,not_removed,yeah and the alternatives to rssbjp is what congress or the commies who import voters from bangaldesh
india,not_removed,the name has pai what else to say
india,not_removed,really dude i am a kannadiga when ever i catch a cab or auto in bangaloreusually near koramangalaindiranagarhsr i find drivers tries to talk in hindienglishmost of the time they cant speak fluently or just knows some words even though it makes me little sad but it also shows how welcomingaccepting we are
india,not_removed,nobody is asking to become an expert in kannada language its about learning a few words and sentences like namaskara hegiddira oota aytha etc many dont even want to attempt that learn a few words and see the reaction of a localite thats all they expect
india,not_removed,why dont them northies attempt to learn some kannada its not kannad by the way i am a tamilian who moved years back and although vast majority understand and talk tamil i made it a point to learn as much kannada as i can

india,not_removed,while the service is not bad lets admit the flaws no direct bus services between popular destinations for example bannerghata road to silk board ecity to hebbal has a handful of buses interchanges are planned horribly for example if you are traveling from ecity to hebbal you need to get down before the flyover and walk for about a kilometer before you can be at the silk board stop low frequency of ordinary fare buses on itpl route forcing people to go for volvos personally dont need ac buses in bangalore weather corruption not uncommon in other transport companies but here it is resulting in extreme high fares
india,not_removed,got nothing against dtc and dmrc combined bro
india,not_removed,yes different regions were under different rules for long times and i think that is reason for diversity actually karnataka is like a mini india about half a dozen regions with very different culturefoodlanguageaccent
india,not_removed,alright alright tn makes better idlis but dosas are ktaka speciality but stupid restaurants in blore come nowhere close to what a masala dosa should really taste like other tier cities in ktaka serve better dosas

india,not_removed,because no bjp government
india,not_removed,incompetent govt
india,not_removed,thanks for the gk man but people will still call it mysore
india,not_removed,well known amongst south bangaloreans for being one of the only two pubs in the area for a long time plus op knows it so referenced it nothing spectacular about the place
india,not_removed,i think it is helping bangalore a lot because people from all across india can come here and feels like home yes it does feels like home because you arent in a situation where you are forced to learn the language only daily activity where i face difficulty in communication is shopkeepers which big basket has solved now all you need is few simple words in kannada and basic understanding to figure out what they say theres no need to even take classes or learn it formally eshtu saar kodi idu adu etc most shopkeepers are nice people they try their best to help you but if you dont reciprocate the same they feel dejected learning kanadda will not help me much in my life for being able to let you live even without asking to learn kannada is generosity any south indian guy cannot live in northren states without learning hindi same goes for tamil telugu malaayalam marati etc in other states but here you arent forced like that thus you just ignore it language is a huge part in once rich culture and affect everyones life as some one pointed it out if the same attitude continues it would create even more friction among people and things will turn ugly nobody wants that
india,not_removed,i just dont have any need to learn a new language we all are in this rat race and will do things based on necessity only i am not being asshole but just want you to understand that learning kanadda will not help me much in my life and thats why it is a low priority thing for me this is why nativists get governments to make legislation that make people learn the language of the state you do your thing so they do theirs
india,not_removed,no one is asking you to master the local language but give at least some respect and do not call it useless it is because of people like your attitude there is outrage in social media often these days one example is e commerce companies and govt putting non kannada ads in a kannada newspaper they decide to spend crores on ads and dont even bother about spending small amount on translators i you travel across old bangalore you will find shops being run by people whose mother tongue is not kannada and everyone speaks atleast bangalore kannada the language problem is only with new people who do not not respect it i guess you are a software professional thats why you dont have the necessity to learn kannada even in that case dont say kannad gothila say swalpa kannada baruthe we will be more than happy btw my mother tongue is not kannada and i can speak in indian languages and you are not true bangalorean if you have this attitude and language is a problem

india,not_removed,til awesome
india,not_removed,we are digging the grave for kannada in bengaluru this way
india,not_removed,nobody will learn a language out of charity either it has to be necessary or the person should have a passion for languages the fact that life can comfortably go on without knowing it shows we have failed to make kannada the dominant culture of bengaluru
india,not_removed,why dont them northies attempt to learn some kannada why should we learn south languages we know both hindi and english learning your language will only be helpful for ordering idly dosa no other use
india,not_removed,based best its a meme
india,not_removed,true that every time i curse myself when i order a mysore masaldose in bangalore sumne mysore hesru haal madta idare
india,not_removed,because no one is a guest in their own country if i can speak english which is the official language then why should i learn the local language if everyone will have to start learning the local language of wherever they work then it would be illogical there are hundreds of languages in india and you cant expect everyone to learn every language so why the special treatment for the local language of karnataka there are thousands of north eastern students in delhi university who cant speak a word of hindi but no one cares because they are still able to communicate using english would you learn assamese if you are transferred to assam or local language of nagaland people say delhi people are racist but damn bangaloreans are much more racist

india,not_removed,the sour syrup used in pandi curry is actually called httpsenwikipediaorgwikigarciniagummigutta not kokum kachampulipanapilukudampuli is a relative of kokum though the dried version has the same deep purple color as kokum and hence the common confusion it is supposed to have several medicinal properties and is also considered to cause weight loss ive given up trying to find it in the us
india,not_removed,well most of north karnataka eats it so it is a part of karnataka cuisine makes sense because a north karnataka has heavy maharashtrian influence
india,not_removed,mysore masala dosa has a red chutney made from red chillies onion and garlic applied to the inside of the dosa before placing the potato stuffing on top of it may be that practice originated in mysore
india,not_removed,also never ask sambhar with dose youll be looked at funny wut was served sambhar without even asking everytime
india,not_removed,but not
india,not_removed,never herd this word uppitu before may be its same and called differently in different region
india,not_removed,proud mysorean here itll always remain mysore for us
india,not_removed,people speak for yourself am from delhi and call it mysuru
india,not_removed,for being able to let you live even without asking to learn kannada is generosity no my friend this is not generosity but a necessity for bangalore to become global city if bangalore was not that welcoming to people coming from outside lesser no of people would have come most of the these guys are from working class who pay their taxes on time and fulfilling their duty for the country on a similar note is it a generosity of outsider which made so many villagers and middle class bangalorean millionaire by buying land here is rest of india is being generous on karnataka by spending money on educationkid welfare and then sending them to bangalore to pay tax there obvious answer will be no my job is about sitting on chair and coding for hours but if i was working on sales team focused on karnataka it would have made sense for me to learn kannada hoping that you get it why without learning kannada i will still be true bangalorean who will care about this city and people
india,not_removed,with all the difference in languages and cultures india has remained united mera bharat mahan
india,not_removed,yeah if that is what they want they should do it though it will be completely illegal if a city will create false need and barriers for entry in citysome talent will move out somewhere where living is better for them with that some industry movement will also happen it is on locals to decide whether they want next flipkartinmobi mncs etc in bangalore or they want to have more kannada speaking people it is their decision to make but they cant have both their cake and eat it other cities are fighting to get next office to be setup in there and people are not willing to move outside of bangalore because culture right now is better than most of cities for outsiders
india,not_removed,hey baruthe means butterfly im guessing it means speak but httpsglosbecomknenbaruthe

india,not_removed,how can i forget beechi
india,not_removed,exactly not sure if theyre planning to build an airstrip and accommodation for the visitors
india,not_removed,i mean marathis all but disappeared in most of mumbai too
india,not_removed,but you kannadigas are soo large hearted and open minded people i am sure you will soon learn hindi and become real indians tamilians are mad fellows of their language dont get spoiled like them d
india,not_removed,it isnt about forcing someone to learn a language but rather assimilating a bit to local culture because one is living in that place like the proverb when in rome be a roman at least to a small extent
india,not_removed,gtfo
india,not_removed,well arrogance wont help in any place also remember you may be in india but if you step foot in my house you are still a guest so goes for a state with its own unique culture and people this polite and welcoming request to not be a guest and be one of our own is not meant for people like you as far as just wanting to speak english there is a phrase for you in kannada ond swalpa ganchali kammi maadu thames nadiyalli tika tolkondu bandirohange adtiddiya
india,not_removed,there are thousands of north eastern students in delhi university who cant speak a word of hindi but no one cares because they are still able to communicate using english theres a difference between a student and a longterm resident i dont expect someone studying in iisc for a few years to become a fluent kannada speaker but someone whos living in karnataka for years would you learn assamese if you are transferred to assam or local language of nagaland umyes this is a pretty normal thing for us south indians we settle in coimbatore then we learn tamil we settle in delhi then we learn hindi we settle in germany then we learn german not sure what your point is if i decided to live in guwahati long term i would definitely take the time to learn assamese
india,not_removed,my friends from karnataka still about those one two weeks school holidays when this happened i heard people were so upset that they were rioting in bangalore is it true
india,not_removed,thats just masala dosa to anyone in karnataka its mostly other places like tn which dont normally use the red chutney which added the mysore qualifier to distinguish it
india,not_removed,the first time i heard the term mysore masala dosa was when i visited pune in not in bangalore not in hubli not in hassan not in belagavi the first chutney smeared dosa i had as i recollect was in mandya in there were also a few places in bangalore that did that none of the famous mysore restaurants raju hotel gtr mylaari nalpak back then did that few of the survivors from that time still dont honestly i think the term was invented somewhere outside karnataka to make it sound more exotic
india,not_removed,thats the sagarification of dosa in old places its still looked down upon
india,not_removed,this httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiupma
india,not_removed,youre in a minority then even my kannadigga friend from mysore calls it mysore only
india,not_removed,wow you must be the greatest developer in bangalore who knows c c java python ruby javascript scala plsql pig r go brainfuck programming and scripting languages but have a problem and feel like its a rat race to learn lines of a local language 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
india,not_removed,with such attitudes the only wish is the ingress to the city could be controlled say with a visa
india,not_removed,what you all think india is not great because i think it is great
india,not_removed,prokannada measures by the state will only be as illegal as prohindi measures by the union government hindis too cant eat the cake and have it at the same time if the union forces hindi upon nonhindis resistance and an attitude that makes hindis feel unwelcome will be a natural consequence if hindis want good employment and a good life out of the lawless cow belt they should respect other cultures who have built up good societies which is one of the reasons why a mnc would first prefer bengaluru to say allahabad or patna
india,not_removed,it means know swalpa kannada baruthe hindi thodi aati hai
india,not_removed,that makes me happy
india,not_removed,a dialect of konkani 🙂
india,not_removed,i guess the cost of the offerings itself would add up to a decent number in itself plus i read that the government is intending to develop other tourist attractions in the district apparently the vip guest house in shravanabelagola has only rooms
india,not_removed,you have obviously never been on a local train then marathi us alive and kicking
india,not_removed,real indians we dont even have the indus anymore the hindi guys need to do something about their own cities i hope there are some jobs created there i wonder if you need a few south indian ias officers to do that too
india,not_removed,force achieves only friction one should learn the language since one likes it and not because someone is forcing one too besides beyond twenty one has so many things to do that it isnt easy to spend time to learn a completely new language a few words is no big deal though
india,not_removed,wish that was enforceable
india,not_removed,ond swalpa ganchali kammi maadu thames nadiyalli tika tolkondu bandirohange adtiddiya kahna kya chahate ho bhaiyya
india,not_removed,i am not bothered to check the translation of that kannada quote because i dont really care and india is one country if there wasnt a common language then i would learn kannada but since there is english to connect the north and south so lets stick with that
india,not_removed,theres a very jolly south indian nearby shopkeeper who doesnt speak hindi except maybe hello or how are you and noone asks him to learn the language because its not his responsibility if one had to learn every language where they are transferred then the people working in banks and government jobs would be stuck learning new language every years my friends dad is transferred to a new place every years
india,not_removed,this is a pretty normal thing for us south indians hah come to delhi once plzz also if you visit mumbai ask any of your south indian autowalla bros whether they learnt marathi
india,not_removed,well we indians no matter from where always discriminate between whites and black and atleast delhi doesnt have signboards saying learn hindi or get the fuck off delhi people can be racist but atleast delhi isnt
india,not_removed,we had more than days off riots happened yes
india,not_removed,i heard the same thing though i live in the us
india,not_removed,yes it is true i was in standard when this happened every day we would wait till in the evening because that was the time when they would announce that schools colleges would remain closed the next day there were organisations demanding the state government to take the necessary actions to ensure safe and swift release of the actor given the history between the states of karnataka tamil nadu with regards to cauvery the agitation escalated quickly many of the organisations took to violence the government was also not proactive enough to diligently handle the situation theaters remained closed nonkannada tv channels were blacked out on some of the days too
india,not_removed,haha got reminded of chandlers joke dont forget to have chinese food when you get there china except they call it just food
india,not_removed,i too realized it after a long time in karnataka by default masala dosa means mysore masala dosa with the red cutney smeared on the dosa outside karnataka masala dosa means tamil style masala dosa with potato curry in the middle and types of chutney so if you need karnataka style masala dosa with red chutney you need to explicitly ask for mysore masala dosa in such places its not authentic karnataka style masala dosa anyway
india,not_removed,ah ok
india,not_removed,what is sagarification
india,not_removed,yes exactly this though upma is avaialable in guajrat the taste is very different i wont consider them as same food
india,not_removed,people do not know much about name changes he will say the weather in mysuru is good the other guy where is mysuru so he could have chosen to use mysore
india,not_removed,in minority then clearly not given all the people in my circle call it mysuru projecting much
india,not_removed,haha do you have rebuttal on any point or just being salty because you are on the internet and visa for whom as much as i know bangalore have more than outsiders if you want to promote some language create a need for this you can either become another mns or produce good work in that language i had watched many telugu movie in my college in north india because those movies were good i will do the same for kannada also if i get something good but you have to understand that no one will do something for others to feel good
india,not_removed,how did it end up being a dialect
india,not_removed,kicking nonmarathi manoos
india,not_removed,ias officers dont create jobs if anything lungi ias officers are incompetent as phuck coz they wont speak yendi language coz lungi pride and only their amma can understand their english accent
india,not_removed,tamma hindi bhashe nahi aata english bhashe no coming kannada matra if this was how everyone in karnataka responded then people who intend to stay long term would learn automatically instead kannadigas have learnt how to speak other languages however badly it may be that some folks make fun of the accent pronunciation etc in the same spirit here is my attempt at a translation thoda chutiapa kam karo aise phudak rahe ho jaise thames nadi me gaand dhoke aa rahe ho
india,not_removed,you actually should its very relevant to every one of your comments why such arrogance towards a polite request though maybe give it a try instead at least for the sake of learning a new language
india,not_removed,if we drop the insistence on pushing hindi and stick to english as the sole official language the kannadigas too might be comfortable talking to others in english and wont want you to speak kannada
india,not_removed,its not a compulsion to learn the local language but what is wrong in learning a new language its for your own sake it will benefit you when you are outside your home state
india,not_removed,south indian autowallas what fantasy land do you live in here in mumbai most autowallas are northies who as you say have not bothered to learn marathi
india,not_removed,the signboard didnt say learn kannada or get the fuck off it said dear citizen if you are living here and dont know kannada please learn and be one among us to not not be a guest forever not sure how that could be phrased any more politely they even said please and invited immigrants to become one of them kannadigas are not an exclusive club we welcome everyone delhi people can be racist but atleast delhi isnt huh of course inanimate objects and places can not be racistor express any sort of human emotion or prejudice when people say a city or state is racist or whatever they are referring to its inhabitants
india,not_removed,why will delhi have signboards saying learn hindi or fuck off when hindi is nowhere comparable to kannada when it comes to treatment meted out by union governments kannadigas have language issues because of hindi hegemony delhiwallahs are racist because they just are
india,not_removed,fast food darshinis
india,not_removed,yeah the taste varies from region to region especially the consistency and the accompaniments that go along with upma
india,not_removed,your circle is in the minority then how many people are there in your circle at max thats nothing compared to the total population
india,not_removed,something similar should be told to those who seek to impose a north indian language on the entire nation
india,not_removed,ok thst was funny but i feel normal marathi people as opposed to the politicians are pretty chill
india,not_removed,incompetent because they dont speak hindi or their bosses dont know english i hope you know that tamil nadu is just one state in south india there are others too
india,not_removed,yep theres nothing wrong in learning a new language but its not my responsibility not my obligation to learn its my wish to learn so even if i do not learn kannada then it doesnt make me a second class citizen or a guest i would love to learn a new language but not as an obligation to be accepted in bangalore but because i have genuine interest in a language
india,not_removed,if i am living in a place where i can get through without learning a new language then why should i do it i am already helping the economy of the state by working there it mutual benefit of the state and individual so i am not a guest in bangalore i am as much bamgalorean as someone else just because i cant speak kannada which isnt my responsibility doesnt mean i will be treated as a guest or a second class citizen delhi isnt racist as it accepts everyone irrespective of his state with open hands i listen to bhojpuri everyday from rickshaw wala guys everyday and i never tell them they are a guest here just because of language difference delhi isnt racist because delhi doesnt have stickers and posters which ask its citizens to learn hindi even politely because its not a national language whereas bangalore or chennai people make it more than clear that learn our language if you will be staying here why its not my responsibility my responsibility as per our constitution is to treat everyone fairly and equally and pay taxes on time which i am more than happy to i refuse to learn another language just to massage peoples ego
india,not_removed,oh you mean the shiva sagar shanthi sagars i was thinking of sagara the town
india,not_removed,maybe your circle is in the minority then how many people are there in your circle at max thats nothing conpared to the total population too much projecting goes on in this sub when they are in the wrong lol
india,not_removed,normal people everywhere are good and politicians everywhere try to poison their minds
india,not_removed,incompetent because they think they can speak english the reality is far from it though and when did i mention tamil nadu youre the choot who said south india and how will ias officers create jobs you dumbo you liar
india,not_removed,logically your argument is very valid there are way too many languages in your country to go around learning the local tongue wherever you go but as you may know our country like all others doesnt run purely on logic people feel more comfortable when they talk in their native language and are usually more welcoming this way this doesnt make them racist everywhere we go though our country people are very accommodating and welcoming we hence and as their guest if not in their homes in their local village hometown we can try to be accommodating and learn to get by in the local language moreover most of the strangers we interact with on a daily basis shopkeeper autocabbus drivers etc arent as fluent with english as the rest of us might be which can be attributed to various factors basically just like you say you cant be expected to learn the local language you cant expect the locals to completely welcome you and treat you as someone who isnt a pretentious douchebag and that isnt racist at all ps you dont have to be a dick and throw around words like racism behind the veil of your anonymous user id on the internet man comes off as pretty arrogant in general
india,not_removed,you absolutely dont need to learn a new language if you dont want to in north we have a common tongue which allows us to move freely across states hindi south india does not have any such language a south indian thus have to learn the language of the state he visits it is not their openmindedness it is lack of options conversational english is limited to elites even in south as a south indian they have to be contempt with few places they can feel comfortable in eg tamil nadu for tamilians andhra pradesh telangana for telugu the farther they move away from their place the cultural void increases however the reach of hindi is such that in almost every city you will find hindi speakers the minute i stepped in chennai i spoke in english but to my surprise the autowalas rather switched to hindi cultural void for us is not as big as south indians another reason we feel comfortable in most indian cities plus there is little incentive in learning local languages learning language of a larger mass of population opens up a bigger demographic to you with hindi most of india open up to you and with english most of the world if india follows the local language theory then you have to learn punjabi for chandigarh telugu for hyderabad tamil for chennai and so on if you know both english and hindi you have learned enough if you settle down and the locals have respect for you you may then consider to learn their language akshay kumar a punjabi speaks fluent marathi i can also speak read write punjabi as well because chandigarh people have been nice to meਸਤ ਸ਼ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ ਸਬਿ ਨੁ ਮੇਰਾ but the common man who visit south cities will feel like he is been subjugated when these cities are trying to remove hindi it is but obvious for a hindi guy to not respect them back and not learn their languages it is a fight for domination rather than assimilation in local culture let them rant
india,not_removed,i dont know why are you being downvoted
india,not_removed,exactly
india,not_removed,when these cities are trying to remove hindi basically you are pissed they they are not catering to you and your needs you claim you dont want to learn another language but have no problem demanding that the rest of india learn hindi theres a reason northies are universally disliked
india,not_removed,no one is asking you to learn the whole language i live in maharashtra when someone talks to me in marathi i reply back in marathi even though it may be poor they always appreciate it thats what decent nonass hole people do though so no wonder you dont northies like you are assholes who dont give a fuck doesnt change the fact that theyre pathetic assholes though this is really the hill you want to die on lmao
india,not_removed,isnt it your need that you want nonhindis to stop asking you to learn their languages when you visit their states
india,not_removed,youre not worth this youre an ass hole people are asking you to just use simple everyday phrases re please thank you how much etc as a sign id goodwill and appreciation to the local community but continue being a pretentious dickwad uzendayo shekiya thats japanese and korean for fuck off and bastard respectively i got that from having an internet connection in mumbai good riddance

india,not_removed,the sat is not an entrance examination in the same sense as the jee universities can and do ignore your sat score if the rest of your application interests them secondly the jee specifically targets engineering students whereas the sat is a general test aimed at all students who have graduated high school
india,not_removed,the admission process in the us and in india is completely different at both the undergraduate and the graduate level i will just stick to the ug process the sat is an exam everyone has to take whether they want to do cs or gender studies the admission process is very holistic and differs from university to university american students just dont gave the sat alone they also give apadvanced placement exams that are offered for subjects like math physicschemistrycs history and many others students are giving more than on ap exam along with their sat to get to top places a students needs to have a strong high school gpaie almost the last four years of schooling a high ranking in his high school near perfect scores in ap exams for subjects relevant to the major he is applyingfor instance its physicsmath and cs for cs applicants along with that participation and great performance in science fairs like the intel science fairs olympiad selection exams like the stuff like participation in the mospmath olympiad summer program can get the recommendations from well known college math professors projects etc this is just the academic portfolio students have to prove participation in extracurricular activities social service write a good essay etc to show that theyre well rounded in the us at the undergrad level the admission committee consists of professors from various departments to get different schools of thoughts the aim of universities barring totally tech focused schools like mitcaltech or any school with institute of technology in its name is to graduate a well rounded individual at the end of four years thus they require a well rounded high school applicant to consider him for admission that is why even stuff like taking a year gap after high school to volunteer in world countries is taken very positively in the us most of the times student apply to the university for a particular major in india most of the times your major chooses you some applicants in the us even enter as undeclared majors they take a few classes in their freshmen year to decide what they want to major in the whole point is in india one exam decides your university major in the us the sat is just one of many steps in the whole process to get into the best schools in stem fields you need to prove yourself through other accomplishments other exams interests the higher you go up in the chain of american universities the higher the quality and worth of your accomplishments is needed so in a way the field is leveled
india,not_removed,i can go on a whole rant on this we have this retarded obsession with entrance exams whether its engineering medicine management or upsc we take excessive pride in the fact that we hold some of the most unnecessarily tough exams for which kids start preparing from the time they turn its a badge of honour to slog away your childhood and crack those exams there is a exam for every damn thing in india exams only test your ability to crack that exam it doesnt test your aptitude or interest in whatever the exam is for
india,not_removed,because overpopulation international universities have a selection process indians have an elimination process it is simply not feasible for a college to look through lakhs application forms and having such low number of seats hence the system where qualify the hardest working fuck the rest also due to overpopulation we have a high number of average to smart individuals and it makes the system set extremely difficult papers to differentiate clat marks difference within ranks also most people are hard working as our way of life and how we are brought up makes sure that the average indian even if not smart due to the route culture will score great marks in international exams ps in india a top engineering college will have seats law will have and medical will have seats compared to foreign univs where a single university will have thousands of students for the same course
india,not_removed,western universities have holistic admission policies you can have a perfect satgre score and still be denied not true in india a lot of primarily american universities use class as an efficient filtering mechanism if you can afford to pay full tuition and youve done halfway decent on your sats you are an asset to them financial if not intellectual
india,not_removed,sat is like cat cat is also easy compared to jee you dont clear sat or cat you just get a score in them with this score you apply to colleges of your choice then its for the college to decide whether your score is good enough for them
india,not_removed,international entrance tests the sat is mainly used in the us sure there are some nonus unis which accept sats as well but saying that there are no international exams arent as difficult is very very ignorant ever tried the chinese gaoko or the japanese nyugaku shiken they are pretty competitive have you heard of the all souls prize fellowship exam its pretty tough as well also a good sat score means jack i scored out of and scored full on two subject tests im still here in india a kid who scored got into a decent undergrad cs course your application essays recommendation letters extracurricular matter as well when applying to a us university not to mention some of them even have an interview most of these kota manufactured rank holders wont be able to stand a minute of those interviews
india,not_removed,who told you sat is easy difference between a and a perfect is as much as one getting air and another getting air in jee us has number of high quality universities which makes it easier for nearly everyone to obtain quality education unlike india berkeley alone admits freshmen every year thats more than all iits put together
india,not_removed,because iit jee has to filter out a billion people to maintain its pride factor toughest selection ratio
india,not_removed,because the competition is far more intense here
india,not_removed,applies to cat it is super duper tough compared to gmat
india,not_removed,sat is a very small part of your application these days there is no sat cutoff like the jee cutoff also the sat is literally just about cracking the test not about understanding any particular curriculum
india,not_removed,what really matters about the difficulty of a test is competition ignore jee even cbse class commerce exams are pretty competitive i dont think you can get into du without getting the intake rate of the us universities is pretty high most topnotch universities have about intake rate across such universities you are guaranteed an admission as long as you are good enough in an absolute sense not so much in india where you have to be really good on the relative scale
india,not_removed,sat is not an entrance exam like jee
india,not_removed,if its simple lot of folks will get making the exam useless
india,not_removed,i think youre comparing oranges with apples here theyre very different from each other in terms of evaluation and scope of study
india,not_removed,there are sat subject tests which are easier than jee too
india,not_removed,we take excessive pride in the fact that we hold some of the most unnecessarily tough exams exactly tough does not mean quality i tell people it is tough to get into mumbai local trains does that mean high quality
india,not_removed,upsc and ies have lowest selection fml
india,not_removed,doesnt help that xiith board marks have become absolutely useless years ago a person scoring could apply to bits directly with his xiith marks now everyone has
india,not_removed,for the we have the management quota seats here taken care
india,not_removed,universities use class as an efficient filtering mechanism thats not true universities dont ask for your financial statistics until youve already been accepted for example the common app has no questions regarding how much your family earns etc
india,not_removed,colleges dont decide if your cat score is good enough or not they keep a minimum cut off and below that its tatabyebye to you
india,not_removed,even the south korean exams are intense they have tons of kotalike cram schools in seoul and other major cities for those exams taking a drop there is kinda blot there like in japan the term ronin is also used for those high schoolers who are taking an year after school to prep for the nyugaku shiken
india,not_removed,still it is easyi wrote both sat and jee jee literally sucked out the juice from my brain and made me feel stupid while sat made me feel like a genius ofcourse the two exams are different but still one can assess the difficulty right
india,not_removed,sat subject tests are like those jee level problems for beginners
india,not_removed,ikr i picked up a math ii book before my exam to see what the questions are like httpwwwreactiongifscomrwtfitgif it went along the lines of math ii is not for everyone is hard
india,not_removed,the answer for that is to increase the capacity and opportunities im aware that these exams became the way they are now due to extreme scarcity of opportunities but over a period of time weve become excessively proud about how tough the jee or upsc is and how hard we have to work to crack them working your ass off to excessively master high school level maths physics and chemistry is not a measure of how good an engineer you are going to be or even whether you have the aptitude for engineering i understand its a lot harder to change exams like the jee right now because we just dont have an education system upto the high school level where we can holistically evaluate a student first we need to start by reforming our education system from the elementary level onwards which is a long term plan and cannot be achieved in the short term but higher level entrances such as upsc or cat can atleast be changed to better evaluate the aptitude of the person and his or her suitability for whatever the entrance exam is for
india,not_removed,not the op but its extremely difficult considering the mindset that x field will give your child more job opportunities or packages than y field which is a consequence of having a very hard paper for entrance into x field becomes a circle after a point of time the effect being the cause if that can be overcome which is an extremely slow process and has to target the next gen we can have people actually picking their interests over picking to crack the toughest exam and bearing no fruit even after doing so
india,not_removed,my question is what have all these iitians actually accomplished have they produced multi billion dollar industries world class research innovative technologies what is the objective evidence theres a world of difference between testing things right and testing the right things
india,not_removed,we tried caste and look where that got us
india,not_removed,its tough to climb everest it means quality
india,not_removed,yep similar principle
india,not_removed,nonexplicit filtering mechanisms are still filtering mechanisms a student with an average indian income is not going to apply to a private american university because he knows he cant afford it even if he were to get in without that implicit mechanism nothing would stop american universities from being absolutely flooded with applications
india,not_removed,keeping a minimum cutoff is pretty much deciding whether your score is good enough or not if iima has a cutoff and you have it is the same as saying that your score isnt good enough
india,not_removed,agreed
india,not_removed,good point for someone who is finishing how to evaluate for selecting to college tough tests in topics from class ten to twelve or tests in topics from bsc btech msc etc even if the latter is done our prep institutions would ensure everyone is ready for that level now what how to filter a ten million applications for seats in less than three months open more iit tn did that theres more engg seats than class twelve students and we know only are employable some of the rest go into mba and there also less than ten are employable
india,not_removed,exactly this sure some iitians have accomplished things but considering how selective iits are is that such a surprise whos to say those same people wouldnt have achieved similar things or even better things if they were at some other university i personally think iits do more harm than help its students blind devotion to the alma mater prevents students from seeing this
india,not_removed,yeah it is tough to get into mumbai trains too does it mean quality then
india,not_removed,student with an average indian income is not going to apply to a private american university you dont see american student applying to indian universities either though also indian universities arent all the cheap for most indian families either
india,not_removed,well i am competing with a guy who is fresh out of undergrad who still retains a bit of his brainpower but has no experience of the real world while my head has marks of years experience and working full time i can only study as much its not a level playing field which makes this score just an elimination point without judging the actual ability of the students and why this country continues to suffer
india,not_removed,which uni are u in now
india,not_removed,well i think we need a culture change that doesnt venerate iitians
india,not_removed,i was going for the larger point about using caste to stratify the population as being neither effective or appropriate
india,not_removed,yes it is faster and affordable than almost all other modes of transportation hence the rush
india,not_removed,yeah the cat is a very criteria if you want good mba students what does a year old fresher right out of engineering school know about business let alone about management and leadership
india,not_removed,while i agree with you his analogy is the closest thing in the indian context doesnt mean its accurate
india,not_removed,graduated working now
india,not_removed,or just call all engineering colleges iits and be done with it for all the praise that they get iits have ruined higher education in the country
india,not_removed,iitians engineers
india,not_removed,if you think that mumbai local trains are quality i have nothing to add really
india,not_removed,indian universities lakh expensive but somewhat affordable with loans what world are you living in where this is somewhat affordable for most indians the average indian makes less than a month how the fuck is that person supposed to run a family and send his son to a school that costs lakh also the average tuition for a college in the us is a year which is more like lakh if youre instate which most americans are while the average american per capita income is a little above
india,not_removed,as a year old fresher in a bschool i totally agree half of the courses make no sense to me at all because i dont have any businessmanagement experience it is better to have worked for years before joining a bschool but the problem is experienced candidates with more than years of work exp are not shortlisted for the top companies
india,not_removed,i wrote both sat and jee back in got an almost perfect score on sats and was in top air for jee whats easy and whats not depends a lot on your aptitude but yes the mathematical part of sats is far simpler and basic than that of jee which is a matter of curriculum but again ive seen people fair very poorly at that as well edit this is not a brag im just trying to make a point you totally did not get an almost perfect score on the sats
india,not_removed,but where did u study
india,not_removed,yep they are maybe your quality standards are different they solve the purpose way better than the alternatives and are a quality service to me
india,not_removed,there are merit cum means scholarships sponsored by the government at least for the iits that waive all of the tuition
india,not_removed,heh average tuition in the us is that ok sure but this would factor in colleges that pretty much accept everyone and the degree would carry much value over other name schools some people do go instate but even with generous financial aid the tuition in a decent college is way more then the figure you quoted
india,not_removed,haha my cousin who just joined one of these it services giants doesnt even know how the company makes its money let alone how the entire customer acquisition process works for them
india,not_removed,but the problem is experienced candidates with more than years of work exp are not shortlisted for the top companies i have not studied at an indian bschool but listening to my friends who have been there the placements are done at different levels and if someone has a decent experience behind him he would be offered a different role compared to the freshers and a much better compensation its not as if the experienced candidates are completely useless
india,not_removed,got perfect score on the sat misspells fare
india,not_removed,thats about in india well then keep in mind that for the top of americans college is more than affordable too also why would a developed nations university lower its tuition to compensate for third world citizens
india,not_removed,companies offering marketing and sales roles prefer freshers some consultancieshrstrategygeneral management prefer experienced candidates so you are right that experienced candidates get different roles those having more than years of experience in it companies find it really tough to get placed years of experience in jp morgan is very different from years of experience in tcs
india,not_removed,i will point you towards isb then firms over there prefer candidates with a good enough experience quality and quantity as for the difference between jp morgan and tcs till the time you are doing decent enough work and have motivation its fine also if you are being hired from a good bschool the firms know that you worked hard enough to reach that level and have developed a rigour in those years in a bschool
india,not_removed,isb is a different case altogether they only admit students with years of work experience iirc also if you are being hired from a good bschool the firms know that you worked hard enough to reach that level and have developed a rigour in those years in a bschool id like to dispute this in a good bschool lots of people have great profiles if you have heavy it experience then you will straight away be rejected from the top companies like consulting bcg mckinsey bain gm tas abg and fmcg pg hul itc just because you are in a good bschool does not mean a good placement trust me ive had a first hand experience of this even though i dont have it background i had shit grades and not many extracurriculars
india,not_removed,isb admits students with years of work experience high score or a diverse profile however the best roles go to students with years of experience trust me i know people who studied over there also if you had a developmentcoder kind of a profile you have to play it smart and understand what they are looking for i went from a coderdevelopment profile to something on a completely different tangent not after i demonstrated to them that i have enough knowledge and competencies so i guess edit i am honestly shocked that mbb rejects people from top bschools unless they are following some strict criteria consulting as difficult as it might be just requires your thinking ability and sound knowledge and not complex finance formulae and stuff maybe they are looking at just freshers

india,not_removed,til india has an ice hockey team
india,not_removed,woh that was really good a really moving story and a well made short documentary but sadly the future seems bleak for the ice hockey team it seems they need serious support from the government to get even remotely good which they arent likely going to get hope they succeed though

india,not_removed,its ladakh not north east but yeah you are stereotyping them as north eastern indians because they look alike why not respect them as indians which they are
india,not_removed,its ladakh not north east but yeah you are stereotyping them as north eastern indians because they look alike you think the average indian care if they cared enough the oriental looking indians wouldnt be facing so much discrimination from their own countrymen they should be seeking out opportunities in the far east since the far east is both politically and economically much more stronger than india why not respect them as indians which they are because india doesnt respect them and they deserve better its like being a woman or minority with stockholm syndrome in a world country

india,not_removed,this is why i laugh when people who are skeptical of the prematurerushedbotched rollout of digitisation are attacked as luddites actually its perfectly possible to want to move to a digital society but to do so with a strong privacy safeguards and b having people who actually know their shit do the rollout neither of which is true today

india,not_removed,the title is wrong the bug wasnt in upi implying the system the bug was in the upi app that bom got developed on contract and only in boms app and no other so yeah of someone calls the entire system prematurerushedbotched because they didnt read the article is rushing to conclusions because of their preconceived biases and anyone calling for rollback of the entire system is indeed a luddite
india,not_removed,i was only commenting on the software engg aspect of it i am certainly not defending the govt far from it i feel they rushed through the whole upi thing without much planning did you read the case where it fails that is a very basic failure case ofcourse there will always be a ton of bugs in any apps and that is perfectly fine this particular bug was a very basic one and should have been caught early edit also from the information given looks like it was due to bugs at both the banks upi app and the upi system npci implementation itself
india,not_removed,your comment is a personal attack on op why are you surprised on downvotes
india,not_removed,tbh i wont underestimate the one side failure of transaction given the number of financial institutions involved number of scenarios where upi can assume transaction successful but in the banks with tons of legacy code and batches running it can actually fail in so many ways just because upi has standards established for banks doesnt mean those are being adhered to deep inside their it estate

india,not_removed,what do you think about this i dont care do you like the uk i dont like or dislike the uk do you want reparations i dont think reparations will be useful for anything other than the principle of the act itself do you want to see their country in economic shambles why would anyone want that

india,not_removed,i really dont care that much about them i mean it would be fun to troll on reddit if the uk disintegrates and i will be trolling rest assured i still realize that if there is an economic collapse it will have adverse effect on india if only for that i wish them good luck otherwise i am indifferent towards them edit it is important to note that i dont think the uk will collapse the brits in my opinion are craftiest mofos on earth if anything i fully expect them to export their misery to row while still enjoying a high quality of life they will come back from this rest assured they have weathered harsher storms and come back stronger original comment continues i do not really want reparations either as a true accounting of it will beggar their tiny nation what they took from us is incalculable the amount of misery and suffering cause by their empire the world over is unfathomable i would like them to know that i would like the brits to recognize that their ties with us were very exploitative and not something to be really celebrated i would like them to not pat themselves on the back for whatever achievements of the indian republic i would like them to learn more about how exploitative the railways something they are proud of and think a positive contribution to india really was and that it was not a gift to us we paid a very high price for it it was essentially theft from the indian people it was a tool paid by us for our own exploitation and repression imo when they say they have special ties with india is kind of like a pedophile saying he has special ties with a little child he molested sadly the brits hardly learn much about india in their school history classes check their school curriculum india and the british empire are optional reading at best india the crown jewel of the emprie is optional that should really tell you something about them i am still waiting for nazi germany period to be optional in germany and this is why many of them seem to think that empire did a lot of good for the world i mean for them it was obviously great or let bygones be bygones tis a strange question you ask did the british let bygones be bygones afaik germany paid reparations for till not even their utter financial collapse in and then again their utter ruination in the dissuaded the british were the germans who were born after responsible for it why did they have to pay i want india as a nation and indians as a people to never forget and never forgive what the british did to us because those who forget history are doomed to repeat it and forgiveness needs to be asked and britain is too proud to ask

india,not_removed,i think you should ask her why is meeting your friends more important to her than her relationship with you it doesnt make any sense im okay if shes angry with you for not letting you speak to your other friends maybe shes a hardcore extrovert but breaking up over that means that she had other reasons too and this isnt the real one you could contact her and clarify if this is the case if she doesnt talk then you tried your best cant control her
india,not_removed,i both agree and disagree with you it depends on how deep you are into the social anxiety rabbit hole ive had it all my life and ive still managed to get girls to like me however those were when i was at a relatively better stage
india,not_removed,what bullshit they do if you dont i feel sad for you but dont tell him this rubbish because its not true maybe you are socially awkward but have some faith dude you gotta try meeting people and doing your awkward thing that is enough

india,not_removed,does it work for prepaid users
india,not_removed,get ready for thank you for buying shittyapp
india,not_removed,wish there was paytm
india,not_removed,working
india,not_removed,its been there on idea form past p
india,not_removed,its been there since quite a while i remember someone on randia mentioning it before
india,not_removed,airtel too same
india,not_removed,i was a voda guy let me tell you they sucks sadly i have realized two things if customers are happy that means staff is miserable staff is happy that means customers are sad
india,not_removed,convenience fees nope
india,not_removed,does it work on airtel prepaid im using jio and airtel slot and tried to buy from the play store but the option to pay through airtel doesnt show up for me
india,not_removed,postpaid or prepaid doesnt work for prepaid i wanna buy nova for fucks sake get your shit together airtel
india,not_removed,tried it yesterday night did not work on airtel
india,not_removed,wow thats pretty cheap
india,not_removed,my play store country is set to usa everything costs more to me
india,not_removed,yes i tried and it works
india,not_removed,same with icici netbanking brother tried thrice to purchase nova debited from account and no app google payments history shows it as pending for a few hours and then as cancelled but money is gone and google payments support gives stupid replies dont use icici with google your money will be gone and you wont be getting back
india,not_removed,pockets card doesnt work on playstore
india,not_removed,according to the airtel tc nope only available for postpaid you can check for other operators from here
india,not_removed,even netbanking option is not showing on my phone android miui rooted updated playstore what should i do
india,not_removed,can you buy music books and movies with that
india,not_removed,actually its been here for months now thing is it doesnt work i have been trying for weeks with airtel can easily buy with net banking though it works for postpaid users only i guess
india,not_removed,because the debit cards of most government banks dont work on google play and even the majority of smartphone users probably dont have a credit card
india,not_removed,hahaha wanted to buy nova launcher desperately so bought it can manage ₹ as convenience fees 👻
india,not_removed,it doesnt work on airtel prepaid according to the tc i tried to buy when my net from jio was turned on and the option wasnt available then i switched my net connection to airtel and tried buying it again and got the option there
india,not_removed,they also added netbanking as a payment method recently
india,not_removed,sadly it isnt available for airtel prepaid according to the tc idea and vodafone support prepaid
india,not_removed,try it again now make sure youre using net from your airtel sim
india,not_removed,it was off
india,not_removed,are you in us or the credit card details are from there you can try changing your playstore location to india
india,not_removed,i dont know what im doing wrong then did you use this on app or website
india,not_removed,fortunately i got my money back both times although it took many days
india,not_removed,not the card paying from it through icici netbanking
india,not_removed,what all payment methods you see screenshot maybe
india,not_removed,addition of direct carrier billing makes it easier for customers to buy apps books movies and songs directly from the google play store from the article
india,not_removed,i dont think sonet banking doesnt work for google play music so most probably carrier billing wont do too
india,not_removed,but now net banking is available and no need to pay a premium like in carrier billing
india,not_removed,its nt the amount its the principle
india,not_removed,ah no wonder i was on my wifi thanks
india,not_removed,app
india,not_removed,debit credit card redeem code no plus sign near bottom right to add any other transaction methods either
india,not_removed,it might but im not going to open a bank account just for using the play store
india,not_removed,desperate times call for desperate measures ☜˚▽˚☞
india,not_removed,hahaha happens
india,not_removed,there isnt any plus button on that page the options are just there on that page play store version
india,not_removed,well fam you can use it for more things then just playstore it will pretty much work on anything
india,not_removed,same version of app only two options are appearing looks like without the paypal option
india,not_removed,i have same version i am getting button then even netbanking option along with billing
india,not_removed,for me i saw the exact same options with option to add vodafone or airtel like this comment threads top screenshot after adding vodafone i dont see the option anymore my best guess is it cant detect the carrier and lets me choose and after gets activated it removes it all so in your case i think you must be having both sims and play store isnt able to understand which remove the one you dont want the billing to be on and then try with just one sim edit also have you given all the necessary permissions to the play store app from miuis security
india,not_removed,play store on my phone looks different than what you have shown in the pic are you sure your play store has been updated to latest version
india,not_removed,ya the button is on the previous page he thought the button is also on the page where we see the various transactions methods
india,not_removed,actually my carrier is tata docomo i was asking about netbanking guess ill have to wait is how it shows now
india,not_removed,yes httpiimgurcomemgbxybpng
india,not_removed,oh i guess i misread your query then google had only activated netbanking for very few countries iirc only india and germany so net banking from only those countries will be allowed this mean play store needs to know your payments are from india ip just tells from where you accessing not a valid payment valid address have you added any other payment method then you address will be there if not then try to add it this will let you add a valid legal address it would know you are from india after that check again you might have the option for net banking if you know any way to add your home address to your account then try adding it and check
india,not_removed,netbanking is showing for me with updated play store app
india,not_removed,yeah this may work i had disabled locations access to google app maybe that why it isnt working ive already added a home address though india is picked from the dropdown list still let me try hope it works
india,not_removed,it looks like my playstore version is latest version
india,not_removed,i dont kno then what is android version on your phone
india,not_removed,android miui rooted
india,not_removed,i am on xperia ui on marshmallow maybe android version matters have you done any research on net about this
india,not_removed,researched a bit but nothing is showing for miui many google apps dont get supported on miui maybe i should update to miui

india,not_removed,couple of examples off the top of my head small companies i think less than people dont have to take govt permission before retrenchment so lot of companies either dont grow beyond or they open multiple companies of people instead of leveraging economies of scale another example is beyond a certain number of employees you have to start giving pf etc this means you must cut employees salary by and put it into pf fund you must also additionally contribute to the pf fund as employers contribution this increases your costs and your employees want cash in hand anyways so this again prevents companies from scaling up
india,not_removed,many points that you make are valid but do you have any idea how much data and training goes into training a computer to play chess and if they do learn how to play chess they can only play chess they are not ai they are just a computer which mimicks things does a computer really understand language it understands that specific subset of language jpmorgan built it they own it it isnt like jpmorgan would shut down and keep printing money forever this is the fallacy that everyone except the paypal mafia understood back in the heydays even then everyone wanted pcs to do everything paypal was the first company to build a risk platform which included humans to verify and computers to flag transactions humans will stay relevant until we have an artificial super intelligence the deemmind computer creates music it requires crazy computational power to generate one second of audio i dont think computers will create their own songs for decades yes there might be some company like tseries which generates an ai to check their songs or stuff but no way tseries will fire every human and have robots working for it this is getting crazy i am sorry i do not know about the manufacturing industry so i cant really say you know even i can give cost avoidance figures say i work in databases and i have a csv file and blah blah i can write a python script to do nearly anything reducing the manual task of into it doesnt mean python is going to do my job unless of course the ai is asi which thinks like us which brings me to the ultimate question if we really do have an asi why the hell would it work for us it has a mind of its own right as a human we are bound my societal rules i couldnt become a pilot because of family pressures i am from a small town so had no clue that being a pilot is a good profession why on earth would an asi work for companies seriously if we do build an ai joblessness is the last thing we have to worry about either theyll stop using the ai because it refuses to do its job or the ai learns about how stupid humans are it just has to read the book the art of thinking clearly and itll judge that humans really are dumb but look at it from a higher point we humans have a purpose in life get settled have kids blah blah who teaches that to computers what is their purpose if it really is an asi wont it be like who are you to tell me what to do you are a measly human who cant even objectively talk about any issue
india,not_removed,did you read lump of labor fallacy youre talking as if the number of jobs is some fixed quantity its determined by supply and demand anybody can work for one rupee a day youre looking at nominal wages im pretty sure real pppadjusted wages are going to increase or at worst stagnate
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,whom are you quoting how do you know that them not getting a job is due to not doing homework go see statistics again and tell me what bell curve is average performance lies in standard deviation which consists majority of them while outperformers are quiet rare for a reason and society is built on the works of these people but to maintain it and develop it you need these average performers they are victims of statistics and economic policies of government
india,not_removed,youre talking as if the number of jobs is some fixed quantity facepalm do you even understand what employment elasticity means its precisely because the amount of jobs arent static that the relationship between employment generation and growth can change in other words this is why your le static labour fallacy is completely missing the point youre just assuming a positive outcome but this is completely delusional the elasticity can trend downwards too and the result is less jobintensive growth which is what has happened to india in recent years anybody can work for one rupee a day too stupid to give serious weight im pretty sure real pppadjusted wages are going to increase or at worst stagnate irrelevant to the topic if productivity improves and employment elasticity falls further then it is only natural that those who remain get to share on a bigger pie that doesnt disprove anything it merely confirms it
india,not_removed,ill concede i missed your point on employment elasticity do you even understand what employment elasticity means its precisely because the amount of jobs arent static that the relationship between employment generation and growth can change when unemployment occurs people will work for less thus increasing employment and regressing to the mean ie the employment elasticity will increase this would mean that about half of those who enter today will never find jobs is not going to happen how does that even work how can people live without ever earning any money surely you are not saying its going to be an apocalypse if you said employment will fall i might not disagree but this is pretty crazy too stupid to give serious weight dont take it at face value i mean that people can work for less and obtain employment im just showing an extreme scenario see natural rate of cycles and busts will change employment but we arent going to run out of jobs in the long term according to multiple surveys twothirds to threequarters of economists generally agree with the statement there is a natural rate of unemployment to which the economy tends in the long run httpsenwikipediaorgwikinaturalrateofunemployment
india,not_removed,modis engagements abroad are anchored in the astute recognition that indias domestic success is inextricably linked to how it can shape its external environment to national advantage for a leader who had barely uttered a word about foreign policy during his election campaign this dramatic and welcome gesture presaged the first of many foreign policy surprises that modi would unveil his emphasis on strengthening ties with indias immediate neighbours his redoubled investment in protecting indian interests in the larger indian ocean region his remarkable outreach to the united states despite past personal irritants his intensification of the emerging partnership with japan his success in preserving balanced ties with both china and russia and his nurturing of important partners in western europe central and southeast asia and in the persian gulf where he demonstrated a geopolitical adroitness unusual in indian foreign policy have all been complemented by an unanticipated investment in building personal ties with pakistans prime minister nawaz sharif and in energising a diaspora that stretches from canada to fiji whether this has involved shoring up ties with key neighbours such as afghanistan bhutan or bangladesh or reaching out to states historically neglected by india such as mongolia or strengthening links with nations that are critical for indian economic success such as germany or renewing ties with those asian countries important for indias strategic interests such as australia japan or singapore and the stans or further transforming relations with the united states modi has invested time and attention not merely in building personal ties with their leaders but also in persuading them to engage with india in ways that redound to its gain beyond these geostrategic aims modi has focused at least a third of his foreign travels on advancing indian economic aims im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme

india,not_removed,full story people used to fuck whomever they wanted and all marriages used to be open marriages until a boy named svethakethu saw his mother with another man he wondered if he was his fathers son or just another bastard so he wrote up the rules about marriage and adultery this is especially hard on women because of what he had seen still he wasnt the old one manone woman or one womanone man person he was slightly lets say liberal his rules a woman can have sex with only her husband when such husband is unable to discharge his duty she can have sex with other men such other men must be with the consent of her husband the number of other men cannot be greater than the children begotten from such other men shall be considered as the legitimate children of the husband if a woman has sex with more than men shes a whore whores regular women rule applies only to humans and not to animals rakshahas asuras devas yakshas kinnarvas gandharvas and other beings practical applications kunti got the boon to summon any god and beget a child from sage durvasa she is young and decides to test it boom sun god surya appears she doesnt want it but he gives her anyway karna is born sun is the first man kunti later marries pandu and it is assumed they have sex pandu is the second pandu later imposes celibacy on himself and kunti begets yuddhistra bhima and arjuna from yama death yavu wind and indra king of gods who are her third fourth and fifth respectively so why do pandu and kunti want kids suddenly because since pandu is more or less impotent and childless the next king would be the first born child to either kunti madri pandus wives or the first born to dhritarashtra and gandhari and gandhari being competitive is on her way to get children thats her way to say fuck you to kunti so kunti tells pandu about her old boon but pandu wants more kids isnt enough because obviously his brother is going to get kids he tells his wife to fill her quota p but kuntis quota is secretly already full not wanting to be labelled a whore she complains that madri needs to get a chance to bear children too and slyly escapes her fate the rest is history also krishna convinces drupada into marrying his daughter draupadi to the pandavas saying its going to within the limit set by svethakethu edit additions and formatting

india,not_removed,so surya deva gave her vitamin d d psst did i do it right acharya plis to do a weekly series thumbs up
india,not_removed,i am not sure where i read but i remember that pandu had a curse that he would die if he has sex because he killed a sages wife when they were midsex in the form of deer or something he was able to resist the urge with kunti but madri was very beautiful and he couldnt resist her and thats why he died and she had twins from that one time ive very vague memory of this and i might be entirely wrong however can you suggest me a good source to read mahabharata i have heard or read most of the stories but they were all from different sources some were told by my grandma with her own embellishments and it would be good to read it in its entirety
india,not_removed,looks at username source is legit guys
india,not_removed,while i have read mahabharata it was the text book version do you have recommendations about books or other sources i can get all this information from a rrated mahabharata i mean
india,not_removed,that makes so much sense ive never heard of shvetaketu or these rules i actually just unquestioningly accepted the stories of the pandavas birth never thinking about why at all things played out the way they did you should write a self post on lesser known gems of the mahabharata like these here on randia
india,not_removed,thats an interesting story
india,not_removed,good post if i may it is not krishna who convinces drupada it was vyasa ok krishna dwaipayana who are her second third and fourth husbands respectively as for pandus celibacy it was ostensibly due to a curse however is a interesting alternate theory similar to what you have stated here behind why pandu even forfeited his kingdom and came to the forest in the first place the author has other interesting reinterpretations of the epics more recently asko parpola has proposed that the pandavas may have come from iran based on the following the word pandu is a loan word from protodravidian word palpand which means pale even today in tamil and malayalam the word pandu is for the disease where your skins becomes whitepale polyandry was practiced in iran by the massagetae tribe this tribe had a custom of burying under megalithic structures there are many pandava rocks strewn all over the country in s india these are called pandavan paara pandu kal etc with legends attributing it to the pandavas edit typo

india,not_removed,always wanted to write a script ever since game of thrones released all the characters in mahabharata are grey and interesting for example kunti is a jealous and power hungry woman when she assists madri in summoning a god for sexy time madri summons the ashwini twins two gods at once divine physicians and has a threesome with them and gives birth to twins kunti is stunned by her move fearing she would give birth to more kids than her and become favourite queen she refuses to share the mantra the second time interesting characters but movies show people as either good or bad
india,not_removed,you are right pandu had no choice because of rishi kindamas eternal cockblock curse he was out in the forest hunting for deer and accidentallly shot and killed rishi kindama and his wife the dying rishi cursed pandu the curse being if he ever tried to have sex with a woman hed die so that effectively made him impotent he ultimately died trying to get laid worst curse ever
india,not_removed,no the twins were not pandus the twins were of the ashwini kumars pandu died after all the kids were born it was because he couldnt resist madris um sexiness madri killed herself because she held herself responsible for her husbands death thats why most of the mahabharat only has kunti and her five sons br chopras mahabharat is the best tv i have ever seen have seen the entire series thrice can watch it again its all on youtube

india,not_removed,it was diwali yesterday and winters are coming now parties and wedding season till december we are currently bracing ourselves for that
india,not_removed,tensions with pak are on the rise because of terrorists they send
india,not_removed,please dont be a lazy bum and do your own assignment it would be really easy to just google the current affairs or follow a news website but dont outsource your homework aswell man not cool
india,not_removed,you can write about the kashmir issue and the geopolitics of the region which is the reason why india and pakistan have fought wars and still engage in lowkey proxy warfare
india,not_removed,you can talk about the recent pakistani actor row and the recent issue between pakistan and india you can also discuss the recent citizen ban the government has no hand this on chinese small consumer good
india,not_removed,to add to the tension between india vs pak comment china who kinda sorta took pak side is being punished and there is a boycottchina goods message across the nation there is a thread in this subreddit indicating fall in sale of chinese goods for diwali
india,not_removed,right now its deepavali called diwali in the north festival going on what it is httpsenwikipediaorgwikidiwali impact last night i was invited by my friends parents for dinner took a bike out rode for a couple of kms turned back and instead took an uber reason smoke everywhere because of the firecrackers its extremely toxic oh i also got a headache granted the whole country is in a joyous mood and i dont want to spoil that but that can be done without burning the whole country down as well its a festival of lights why does it have to include sound and environmental pollution as well
india,not_removed,craze of reliance jio volte
india,not_removed,festive season here
india,not_removed,our festive season just began everyone whos getting married get married now
india,not_removed,first you outsource call center jobs to with less than minimum wage salaries and now you want us to do your homework for you give us and well even do your dissertation
india,not_removed,the water wars check on tamil nadu vs karnataka cauvery river issue pseudonationalism is in fashion these days right wing is enjoying full support minorities are somewhat fearful because the federal govt belongs to someone who was chief minister of gujarat during antimuslim riots we just had diwali in my statepunjab a newly formed party is disturbing the election pattern the elections are due in we have different state and federal elections also we are battling drug crisis man our nation is interesting
india,not_removed,and yet we celebrate halloween
india,not_removed,what are the elections on exactly
india,not_removed,free except its not
india,not_removed,im not asking you guys to do it for me im here asking for ideas that are actually affecting the people currently instead of just talking about the religion or economics i have been doing research ive been subscribed to this subreddit for the past months im not trying to cheat i just felt like getting some input from people who are actually experiencing the events would be much more effective to write a paper on as opposed to writing a paper off of news reports this wasnt meant to be the easy way this was meant to be the effective way sorry if it came off as write my essay for me
india,not_removed,lol thats what we indians do
india,not_removed,its not low key anymore parrikar and modi have unleashed the hanuman in the army because of their rss backgrounds
india,not_removed,i for one only use organic allnatural crueltyfree free range fair trade sustainable renewable glutenfree low carbon footprint energy neutral biodegradable smokefree green fireworks made from recycled stuff and hemp by socially responsible local unionised artisans and i purchased it from a cooperative
india,not_removed,yeah ive seen a lot about diwali on this subreddit lately thank you so much for your input is it really that smokey i know that it is a big deal but i just cant see there being that much smoke
india,not_removed,wed be fine if we only used fireworks sparingly but no every little chutiya moment needs a rassi bomb moronic
india,not_removed,omg so very mean but so very indian i love it btw i can do the dissertation for just mail me at typicalindianstartupglobaliseme
india,not_removed,im asking for input not for you to do it for me sorry for trying to write a paper on current events that actually matter instead of what the media says matters
india,not_removed,thank you very much ill be sure to look into all of those later today
india,not_removed,elections for the lower house httpsenwikipediaorgwikiuttarpradeshlegislativeassembly of the indian state of

india,not_removed,reminded me of george carlin
india,not_removed,lol i cant tell if youre being serious or not
india,not_removed,depends on the location i guess outside of densely packed cities tier cities that already have pollution issues its not that bad i have asthma but i wasnt affected yesterday unlike last year when i was in bangalore tier city not that it was unbearable in bangalore either but the difference in air quality was somewhat noticeable ive never seen anything like the atmosphere literally being filled with smoke but then again i dont travel around much
india,not_removed,it depends upon where do you live in my city the amount of firecrackers have gone down drastically compared to last couple of years from discussions on this sub it seems condition in delhi is far worse compared to other cities are reporting that this year condition in mumbai is far better people are becoming more aware i personally havent busted crackers from past years though i used to love it while growing up
india,not_removed,hey we have a wheat belt in north india post harvest the dry stalks etc are burnt at farm since it is a big area it becomes the capital delhi s smog problem in winter every year plus the population of delhi celebrating diwali makes it a powerful air pollution combination
india,not_removed,not too smokey but pretty noisey lots of firecrackers busting on all this smoke risks into
india,not_removed,you would freak the fuck out if you saw the smoke
india,not_removed,damm it competition and ill write a book based on dissertation email me
india,not_removed,take my advice dude reddit is not the best place to ask such questions and expect useful sensible answers anyways india is a huge country with billion people and most events are unlikely to affect all its people simultaneously eg the kaveri water dispute if you really want to write about something that really matters to all indians your safest bet would be to write about some international level issue such as the ongoing voluntary civilian boycott on chinese goods indian bid for permanent unsc membership etc also this years pollution free deepavali celebrations is the best thing to write about if you want a nonpolitical topic
india,not_removed,again pay us and we will write it for you
india,not_removed,top have an upvote
india,not_removed,hes being serious very serious
india,not_removed,and you say that using reddit isnt the way to go this comment alone proves you wrong thank you so very much
india,not_removed,he is so serious that he wrote this reply from a icu bed
india,not_removed,it just seemed way too specific with way too many adjectives thank you lol edit gonna be honest dont see why this was downvoted but oh well
india,not_removed,why so serious
india,not_removed,im the mercury amongst metals my friend the misfit exception that you find different in everything i just gave a useful answer coz once upon a time not very long ago i too had joined reddit under the same misconception as you and i would still like it to become that kind of a place but then again im probably top of charts in being downvoted and trolled for the same reason now buzz off youve got homework to complete
india,not_removed,youre welcum welcum to india
india,not_removed,lol this report isnt due until december i just figured asking earlier would help me get a broader perspective of the country and the people in it while also giving me solid specifics to help met decide on a topic also ive been on reddit for the past years i understand how it works theres always people who will help and thats why i made this post
india,not_removed,of course im not trying to dissuade you from using reddit just made the point that if you wanna see the rainbow you gotta put with some rain too you were pretty dejected with the joke well maybe you have had only a good experience with reddit till date and yes obviously there are going to be nice people tooas you have just found out but stretch the conversation beyond a certain limit and one ends up wasting their time hearing philosophical rubbish from completely bored strangers as you are doing right now and if you are enjoying that too i can use an up vote or two lol btw im not a mean representative of the people of india no puns intended

india,not_removed,are you going there to get a green card or are you going to get a green card and then go there you need to fit in one of the categories based on your occupation and sponsor is the most common which takes a lot of time you will meanwhile need some status to stay and work there which usually is the visa you can find employment provided your are skilled and a fit green card does not increase your chances of securing a job not an immigration lawyer though
india,not_removed,how would that have any effect on the quality of mba done
india,not_removed,can anybody knowledgeable on the subject comment on if this was a huge shock or there was an anicipatio in general public that this could happen say a firing or terrorist attack from pak in jk is not a shocker wat about this
india,not_removed,general public had little to no idea of animosity with china so those who were not working in defence agencies or had contact in defence agencies were shocked by this new war intelligence agencies and defence agencies were suspicious of the activities in the regions of laddakh and arunachal pradesh our defence minister was a mellow man who believed too much in hindi chini bhai bhai meaning indian and chinese are brothers and thus didnt paid much attention to the defence agencies warnings making it more difficult for the army to retaliate
india,not_removed,afaik the military definitely suspected it thimaiyya wanted bulk of troops on china border while menon insisted pakistan was a bigger threat
india,not_removed,uivarun
india,not_removed,thus didnt paid much attention to the defence agencies warnings making it more difficult for the army to retaliate i expanded on this in my other comment on this comment chain its partially true military was hampered by the political establishment but the war itselfand the defeat and its scope was not due to that the results of the war would have been same regardless ie had army gotten nefa on their own terms and not forced to take reigns of that area that is because the military was already stretched thin even to this day we cant cover flank war we most definitely couldnt back then and as mentioned military was already complicit in making the situation bad in other sectors of the border and strategic policy making this time in collaboration with the political establishment ie to not sort the border and have a uncompromising and exclusively indian perspective on its so the first paras of your comment is quite correct general people werent aware but the military and political elites did have a sense that it could happen they just gave a low risk metric to it and hence the reason for india escalating the issue progressively in the
india,not_removed,using the word definitely here is inappropriate and rather inaccurate both the military and the political class were complicit in what happenedas causative entities in the run up to the actual war it was india who instigated this messchina was at fault too because it takes to tango and they did launch the active war but the contribution for the mess for not equivalent not in the least and post defeat india framed a narrative of innocence and victimization complex which has warped the minds of generations of indians with brainwashing levels of propaganda chinese public has its own debilitating warpingbrainwashing dynamics on a variety of issues but we are not a paragon and on this particular matter we put them to shame in the scope of it as for the thimaiyya wanting troops on the border that is not actually so straightforward nehru bypassed thimaiyya and handed over the north east frontier agency directly to the army and thimaiyya was not comfortable with this because this in his mind could be construed as an aggressive move by the india and secondly this would stretch the military lines because nefa was underdeveloped and undermanned but thimaiyya did also clash with menon as well militaryusing generically here because this understanding was not acted upon in a coherent manner intelligenceintuition doesnt mean action on that was getting a sense that a war could happen as all militaries know and often prepare for but india of course never had and even to this day doesnt have the resources to plug border flanks so was tactically handicapped no matter what it knew beforehand and by the time all these meetings and internal conflict in indian establishment were taking place in it was almost too late anywayhaving the knowledge of hindsight now the mess was all sowed in the mid and it never really went away it continues to get worse all the way till the war finally happened along the way incorporating multiple reasonsoften related to the root cause of the war and often not and causative events on both sides india and china it was a collective mess there was no singularly good or singularly bad entities even the henderson brooksbhagat report mentioned this that the military elite were not doing their jobs properly and were too busy mingling and making connections with the political elites and that the political apparatus was too restrictive on operational demands of the military and so on it critiques all and its obvious to see why its never been released because it breaks the propaganda facade of india being a victim and that military being all steadfast heroes and politicians villains

india,not_removed,yea there are plenty of news stories in which people get offers straight out of iit i mean yes you do have to be smart but still thats pretty much the norm at all the big tech companies

india,not_removed,and seattle austin boston nyc etc
india,not_removed,yes
india,not_removed,asap
india,not_removed,is lacs bro
india,not_removed,lakhs is just under in usa aside from that the number of students receiving these offers in all iits engineering colleges combined wouldnt exceed students per year if you meant it for indian salaries
india,not_removed,i doubt people get those kind of salaries in texas in austin they do
india,not_removed,not in boston or austin at least in a non it role e austin has an low cost of living compared to other parts i dont think it freshers would be making there

india,not_removed,sadly the same people in this case a ceo will be the same people that lobby to make more tax loopholes that will let them move manufacturing offshore if these ceos really wanted to see america grow and prosper as against their own and shareholders wealth they wouldnt behave like crybabies every time theres talk of raising minimum wage or company paid healthcare for workers while their bottom line improve american companies are showing tremendous profits quarter after quarter but most workers in manufacturing and service sectors dont see any of this prosperity due to the outsourcing of manufacturing truth is irrespective of who the president is these companies wont give a shit about the country or the citizens as long as their profits are rising theyll lobby for more laws that make it easier for them to pay their workers next to nothing while telling the rest of the world how great america by looking at the stock markets

india,not_removed,big endorsement
india,not_removed,im not a modi hater but no next us president does not need to take anything from modi
india,not_removed,ceos complain anywhere where ever they have to pay taxes as much as i find it despicable their are doing their job of providing returns to shareholders the blame lies with politicians for being so easily influenced by corporate lobbies and in case of usa the biggest blame lies with voters who believe in trickle down economics
india,not_removed,if these ceos really wanted to see america grow and prosper as against their own and shareholders wealth why would they thats a ridiculous expectation to have from a corporate entity
india,not_removed,us does have some limited social schemes like medicare medicaid subsidized housing rent control laws etc but they all eventually benefit the corporations due to the way the laws or the contracts are awarded at a higher level the problem with indian government is that most schemes are only implemented on paper when you drill down youll see that the people who need these schemes the most are never the ones that are benefited from the schemes its usually the touts the brokers etc that run away with most of the money disbursed for these schemes im not saying either is better americas corruption mostly happens at a much higher level thats not easily visible to the lower and indias corruption happens at the all levels
india,not_removed,not arguing against our programs but i would definitely love to see dbt and a really change in its distribution the first would be that everyone should file tax returns even if they still dont have to pay income tax a lot of rich farmers and others get away with it income tax filing should be the basis for lot of social policies i think rather than making it voluntary as much as i appreciated it govt should cancel lpg subsidy to any household earning more than lakhs
india,not_removed,indian government pretends to be solely working for its poor class while giving tax breaks and bailouts to the top as they amass massive wealth
india,not_removed,it was just an opinion
india,not_removed,theres no morality left in politics or business any more a ceos job that is described to be to provide returns to shareholders by fucking over his employees with no moral convictions whatsoever and nobody bats an eyelid his job might be to provide returns but at the cost of healthcare and other benefits for the employees where do we draw the line between good shareholder returns and fuck the employees
india,not_removed,because over a long term a corporations growth does depend on the growth of the country where it operates

india,not_removed,not justifying but pointing out that it is what shareholders demand they demand better returns no matter whatever costcutting measure the company uses that is why a lot of companies are either delisting from stockmarkets dell or are privately held four seasons a lot of companies or sectors require high rd costs and the roi will require a long time also the constant pressure to show profit every quarter means focusing on longterm especially if it requires shortterm pain becomes a problem

india,not_removed,it is irrational choice not thinking of long term consequences is irrational
india,not_removed,that is what poor people and many of the younger generation of the uppermiddle class do not think longterm

india,not_removed,not an excuse everyone has to make responsible choices
india,not_removed,checkout instamojo or razorpay
india,not_removed,jus pay and razorpay are payment aggregators id suggest you go with these because they offer the benefits of a integration with all the payment gateways banks which they take care of b load balancing when things fuck up and c if you are saving the customers cards the you wont lose them when you change the gateway
india,not_removed,op why did you go with magento isnt shopify enough for most cases
india,not_removed,citrus pay razorpay payu payumoney there are lots of options for you try out and let us know i think nemo from razorpay is a regular at rindia he can give a better answer for this p
india,not_removed,instamojo does not do general ecommerce razorpay is great for withinindia payments but sucks donkey balls for international payments
india,not_removed,do not know enough about razorpay but stay as far away as possible from instamojo they offer no little support so much so that the person would have made the payment but you would not get to know unless the person tells you and then you go ahead and tell them it happens way too often
india,not_removed,dont know about payumoney but payubiz integration is also quick and easy they help you every step of the process but they also have the usual transaction failure issues every once in a while razorpay has better success rate
india,not_removed,hey while werazorpay offer multiple wallets we are not a gateway aggregator like juspay and work directly with multiple banks juspay otoh works with other gateways like us and payu we are a wallet aggregator though since we gotta catch em all disclaimer i work at razorpay
india,not_removed,shopify doesnt allow customization to the extent that magento does in magento you can write your own php modules for almost everything ranging from inventory to crm to payment gateways besides its your own selfhosted solution so its far cheaper than shopify
india,not_removed,haha nemo here at your service im checking this thread and am happy to help in case you have any queries about razorpay
india,not_removed,afaik you can do general ecommerce but have to integrate with their api if you are using magento both of them have integration httpsgithubcominstamojoinstamojomagento httpsgithubcomrazorpayrazorpaymagento if you are working with the apis i prefer razorpay cause the apis are nice i have only helped friends integrate these do not know continued usage and support status
india,not_removed,instamojo does not do general ecommerce can you elaborate about general ecommerce as a seller what restrictions can i face with instamojo
india,not_removed,sucks donkey balls for international payments can you elaborate on this please
india,not_removed,yeah but plus side is that registration seems to be very fast and easy on instamojo compared to ccavenue or the other big ones which means good for the startups right
india,not_removed,sorry i stand corrected
india,not_removed,space vs tabs
india,not_removed,great can you share with us some ecommerce sites that use instamojo as their payment processor
india,not_removed,my understanding is that they are not a full blown payment processor for ecommerce sites they allow you to send links to customers for payment these links open on instamojo site this is more like sending a paypal invoice i dont know their current state of development
india,not_removed,a friend had tried razorpay who sells stuff internationally the success rate was really low most transactions failed because international bankscards considered razorpay domain shady declining trx for security reasons i dont know about their current situation may be it has improved others can chime in
india,not_removed,if time is a concern dont go for big ones first razorpay and instamojo teams are new age guys and are really fast since instamojo has some issues i strongly recommend razorpay
india,not_removed,whatever the style guide says usually spaces
india,not_removed,yup youre right however they can act as a payment processor for any website however theyre less than ideal for that case
india,not_removed,thank you for this which payment gateway works best for international payments then
india,not_removed,however they can act as a payment processor for any website however theyre less than ideal for that case so what is lacking then
india,not_removed,i havent tried it but payu should work since its an international gateway which is offering payment service to india other than that you are left with the big ones like ccavenue and billdesk
india,not_removed,most gateway would have this transaction declined thing the success rates are different i dont have any comparative data on this the friend settled on ebs though
india,not_removed,i saw it mentioned on twitter so knew the reference havent watched it yet though
india,not_removed,international payments
india,not_removed,dont know about international payments they just say on their pricing page httpsrazorpaycompricing
india,not_removed,thank you
india,not_removed,really theyve declined every time ive asked them edit i guess you work for instamojo so my question is what is the success rate of instamojo for international transactions
india,not_removed,this morning when i turned tv on there were only two news terrorists fled and place xyz caught on fire because of crackers and that for a minimum of about different places
india,not_removed,we all know here that we are literally breathing smoke minute in minute out but we cant do shit about it all we can and will do is post our frustration over here because we are all like minded fellas here and wed listen to one another and cry out over the apathy of general mass on this issue just like myriads of other issues affecting ours and everyone elses lifeand then at the end of the day well go to our respective beds and sleep next day cycle repeats let me tell you a story in full quorian style plz not to kil me i burnt a lot of crackers in my childhood as well as in teenhood but when i grew up a little i got interested in this planet we all live oni quickly understand the concept of green house effect and gases particulate matter various sources of pollution etc what i realized that there is only one thing i do that i can stop if i give a fuck about myself i stopped bursting crackers alltogether i for years tried to reason out with people i know the ill effect of toxic gases they release but my pleads fell on deaf years i watched meekly as everyone else around me burnt their cash conclusion i couldnt even stop my relatives from bursting smoky crackers how can i even imagine that i can bring about a positive impact on society as a whole hence i stopped minding because theres nothing else i can do my parents bros and sis could listen to me at the most but not any other single person hence i suggest to my good and evil randians here to stop fretting about it and keep living
india,not_removed,unless you criticize muslims for barbaric mass slaughter talk about tree felling all over the world stop using acs and eating meat disown personal vehicles let me reiterate you got no right to criticize hindus and their festivals because we are like what fucking jews used to be in europe remember thats how it all got started our festivals are systematically being targeted by hinduphobes in the guise of islamism and westernism do you know that we will continue to shit on the immediate environment because even though there is no fucking religious basis or any slight suggestion by any great acharyas of the dharma but thats we what we have been brought up with and hence boycotting crackers is a call against our beliefs and a grand conspiracy against us no we wont change end of shut down the factories ban meat industries get adjusted to desert coolers and sell your cars first before you have the audacity to talk against the toxic shit that we continue to breathe until then we are gonna mock you call you names and talk about your hypocrisy and laugh at you wheezing

india,not_removed,i dont find anything wrong in it if you dont ask for ban on non veg food and criticise them you do not have any right to criticise diwali it is my festival and i will celebrate it in any way i like you should just shut up
india,not_removed,this add the smilies though and share prayer
india,not_removed,bbc singapore is reporting it right now
india,not_removed,pakistan and china have infiltrated every cracker sold in india and replaced it with poisonous gas the smoke you see today is nothing like anything before what if ramdev capitalizes on this and launches patanjalitm crackers made by traditional methods
india,not_removed,what if i told you the first point was even spread around not kidding at least different idiots sent me the forward
india,not_removed,also add forwarded as received
india,not_removed,i stay an apartment complex and residents were blasting it like there is no other day i requested one of those aunties to reduce the usage a bit but she literally showed a middle finger i went back to my apartment and took some sleeping pills by gods grace im alive
india,not_removed,needs to be more compressed
india,not_removed,i almost thought you were serious
india,not_removed,few days back i saw a post about burning crackers to kill mosquitos somewhere on facebook some idiots were promoting it and saying stuff like finally people wont die from dengue chikangunyaetc then a lady posted against it and she had a surname khan oh god how these assholes started saying random shit to her like you stop killing goats on bakried you have problem with hindus go back to pakistan stop eating non veg etc like wtf though some people were defending her but of no use as they also got abused i just reported it and ask others as well to do the same to get it removed as theres no point arguing with such assholes
india,not_removed,thank you
india,not_removed,stop using ac there are people and organisations who work towards spreading this awareness stop using vehicles use public transport vehicles are basic necessity of modern world burning crackers is not one is necessary evilanother is unnecessary evil besidesover the period govts companies and public in general have tried all possible ways to reduce pollution that is being emitted by vehicles stop using cfc stop using refrigerator cook fresh there are various people who have spread awareness in this regards stop consuming meat againconsuming meat is not done for fun burning crackers is stop cutting tress for christmas surei have seen many people working on that front to spread awareness stop bursting crackers for deepavali read above points just like people have opposed all types of pollution and worked towards it why make an exception for diwali what is so special about diwali group of people worrying about diwali pollution is no big deal before going all bakrekyunkatehobe on me please understand that your own friendsfamily and you yourself are going to suffer from this air pollution just because currently armchair warriors are all into liberal vs bhakt matchesdoesnt mean liberals are suddenly a bad thingliberals have always opposed bad practices in hinduism as they have for past couple of centuries and they will continue to do so
india,not_removed,the major issue is burning of fields all year long and the diwali crackers this week ac refrigerators and meat seriously wtf have very little to do with air pollution
india,not_removed,this cigarette will not kill me of cancer
india,not_removed,jokes on you fuckwit because most countries in the world are adopting diwali as a national holiday the prime minister of australia here wants to make diwali a private public holiday also many rich overseas born hindus are making australia uk canada usa and countless other countries a more hindu friendly place
india,not_removed,wow did you just compare same sex relationships which do not affect anybody other than them to bursting crackers which increases pollution levels to such hazardous levels that it causes breathing problems headaches decreases life expectancy of millions
india,not_removed,religious freedom does not mean freedom to disturb others peace or quality of life it only means you get to practice whatever you want as long as it doesnt adversely impact others
india,not_removed,the only creatures we use for non veg food that release greenhouse gases at an alarming rate are those that give beef but sure believe what you wanna

india,not_removed,the single largest contributor to global warming is the meat industry so yeah abstaining from consuming meat would go a long way towards saving the environment
india,not_removed,meat consumption as actually one of the most polluting activities you could partake in
india,not_removed,refrigerators and meat seriously wtf animal farming contributes to a huge amount of pollution
india,not_removed,even unesco declared diwali as the best holiday hope you guys do blast like this on those countries too
india,not_removed,there is major activism happening on all those fronts and it is happening for diwali too most christmas trees are plastic btw made in china
india,not_removed,i will prefer liberals fighting for bad practices in hinduism anytime over right wingers who want to take hinduism back into the dark ages
india,not_removed,will your replies change if someone tells you they oppose the shitty actions of all religions
india,not_removed,or they could do this
india,not_removed,how
india,not_removed,its still stupid to stop consuming meat just because it impacts the environment if you wanna reduce pollution then there are a lot more effective ways of doing it my point stands field burning and crackers are worse the west eats a ton of meat yet their cities are clean same with acs and refrigerator consumption asking people to stop using both really wont do much
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,well we already had our diwali celebration and its taken our country hour to restore the atmospheric levels back to normal its the population of people that are celebrating it in india thats the problem do your part and dont have children please
india,not_removed,this will address only one part of problems the water and resource wastage for non veg food is not sustainable the per calorie water wasted is huge
india,not_removed,a staggering of all emissions emanating from the us are because of beef cows release an outrageous amount of methane methane has a much more profound effect viz climate change when compared to with molecule of methane causing as much ghe as molecules the un has released a paper about how unsustainable meat consumption is and how polluting it is
india,not_removed,no it isnt and your point doesnt stand non veg food is way more damaging to environment than crackers
india,not_removed,well we already had our diwali celebration and its taken our country hour to restore the atmospheric levels back to normal thats really great achievement unfortunately the things very different in india especially the areas where neoriches lives it is full on blast pm for the last days rest of the time they will do crackers in every minutes that too in a society where a lot of elders and kids lives are you saying that we dont have to worry about pollution if there is no child
india,not_removed,no they are not disposed they are stored for use the next year usually they are used for years they dont get destroyed easy even malls use plastic trees they are easier to decorate
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,so entertain me now should dairy products be banned
india,not_removed,the seaweed is for the cattle not for humans
india,not_removed,because as uinstallgentooplease said theyre completely different types of pollution car pollution diwali pollution field burning all cause particle pollution which is what delhi and the rest of india is choking with pollution due to meat is completely different and honestly not a huge deal at all compared to the former
india,not_removed,pollution do you eat meat do you drive a car do you use nonrenewable plastics if you answered yes to any of these questions then you can always leave india is a hindu country buddy and if you havent done anything else to fix the world or environment theres always usa for you heres a suggestion if every muslim and athiest and non hindu in india left right now the pollution the country generates would be alot less then what it is now ever thought about killing yourself
india,not_removed,are you fucking kidding me beef and cattle rearing has promoted global warming so much that if we hadnt ever reared them effects of global warming would have been reduced by a whole fucking fourth
india,not_removed,yes dude i eat meat i eat cow meat i eat beef burgers i love beef so yummy ever thought about consulting a therapist
india,not_removed,treating people like virtual untouchables is enlightened
india,not_removed,okay no milk butter yoghurt or anything right
india,not_removed,lets ban people
india,not_removed,its a good idea would you also advocate limiting what percentage of adults are allowed to have children after all humans are responsible for almost all problems they face perhaps its time to stop attacking the periphery and attack the culprits head on
india,not_removed,and what is the danger to citizens of delhincr mumbai etc global warming or the extremely hazardous levels of pollution for the last timeim not saying that meat is not damaging to the environment but the effects of meat on metros is nowhere near the scale of field burning firecrackers and car pollution those are the most direct threat to the health and safety of the metro living population jesus fucking christ reading comprehension people
india,not_removed,you just lost the argument
india,not_removed,dont be silly you cant enforce such a rule without massive backlash
india,not_removed,naw naw bro its not like global warming is an issue
india,not_removed,poor defense
india,not_removed,whats my argument
india,not_removed,of course but as we are going to find where the problems arise from its perhaps good to point out that humans are responsible for a massive amount of damage we are responsible for extinctions of neanderthals to begin with and then have continued destroying its about the degree of caring if we claim to care a lot for the environment perhaps we should also consider selfdestruction as a way to rid the planet of its worst pests
india,not_removed,why not just asking after all vehicular pollution is worrisome and there we do not request but enact laws
india,not_removed,youre underplaying something that exists not in some remote corner of india but right in its biggest megapolis and the more you spin yarns to pretend its a nonissue than admitting its something that shouldnt be encouraged the more will it cause disillusionment and lead to irreconcilable differences it is well known the vegetarian argument is a facade to keep only some hindus out no amount of jumlas will change that

india,not_removed,heres how its gonna go agent joe allen johnson and crouch will each put one past courtois in an embarrassing defeat for chelsea liverpool will go on to win against city courtesy of a hendo screamer and a late woodburn winner thereby bridging the gap by points then on jan shit will go down as liverpool faces chelsea and wins to come on par at the table
india,not_removed,psst be low key mentally sacrilegious make mental fun of the overdressed folks and turn into a fashion critic kyun aunty slap another tonne of frosted pink lipstick sure the would come back
india,not_removed,is that even a word yep it is
india,not_removed,as an irreligious person are you indifferent to the story of the suffering of jesus genuine question
india,not_removed,its ok buddy think of it as spending time with them ignore the church related factors then
india,not_removed,dont think like that maybe hisher parents are different
india,not_removed,me and my staff will be having fun ill see myself out
india,not_removed,its okay just a calf injury his fearful eyes and screaming larynx are enough to keep that calm costa smiling
india,not_removed,oh such are the delirious haters whats your prediction for arsenal
india,not_removed,oh yeah i do this all the time most of the time its about the sermon though
india,not_removed,httpswwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryirreligious here you go saar
india,not_removed,im not at a symbolic level i respect christian theology and christ but i dont find much utility in being pious also i find the way they label people saved and sinners a bit unpalatable too much judgment
india,not_removed,yeah it bothers me until i get there but i dont have much trouble sitting though the mass
india,not_removed,my guess was true though
india,not_removed,easy win against palace tomorrow helping them cement their righteous spot
india,not_removed,i heard a goan priest once say that youngsters are betraying the church
india,not_removed,i find the church service too long drawn out every week coming to the same place to chant some incomprehensible stuff
india,not_removed,thanks good sire already googled found a new word to describe us adharmi paapi naastik folks
india,not_removed,you can always find solace and strive to imbibe some attributes of jesus his story is one of infinite love for all no matter what cant say the same about whatever has been built around his legacy so i can understand the part about labels the clergy puts on people presumably to achieve their own ends
india,not_removed,which church you belong to
india,not_removed,the narrative in my church is more like poor innocent young people are giving into temptations of the devil
india,not_removed,it is too long and drawn out almost everywhere in india
india,not_removed,i say irreligious because like me a lot of people are confused about whether they are atheists agnostics antitheists deists reformists or humanists and irreligious as an umbrella term makes sense because the only thing thats common among all these people is disregard for religion in its current form
india,not_removed,lutheran
india,not_removed,oh yeah that too there is a verse in the bible which they keep repeating and whoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea and then there is the usual bullshit of not keeping the sunday for the sabbath ie only complete rest prayer no entertainment or sports
india,not_removed,you should just state that you believe in force and write the same when filling out forms and stuff because of your username
india,not_removed,thats great lutherans are a very progressive church germany scandinavia etc are majority lutheran and have been at the forefront of becoming irreligious enmasse i have met lutheran priests in norway who were super cool with homosexuality freedom of expression etc infact they even have female and homosexual priests eventually the indian lutherans will also accept them
india,not_removed,had no idea that there were lutherans in india
india,not_removed,that bullshit about sabbath must have been relevant when jesus was talking to practicing jews it doesnt make much sense now anyway most christian preachers are bipolar about jewish customs from the old testament they say that faith in jesus freed us from those obligations but they keep bringing up some old rules iirc jesus had an exchange with the pharisees and sadducees about sabbath
india,not_removed,its weird that they ask religion in many forms even today a bank needed that info to open an account
india,not_removed,andhra lutherans talk about reformation and martin luther a lot but the church isnt connected that well with the original german church anymore theyre connected well with american churches though
india,not_removed,lots in andhra pradesh and odisha
india,not_removed,last time i asked someone they said its mandatory by our laws i said fuck it i am gonna write none anyways
india,not_removed,the church in jharkhand where the original german lutherans came is still very connected to german roots also trends show that lutherans tend to become irreligious in the largest numbers among all christian sects may be there is something in lutheran culture which encourages skepticism and rationality among young people are there telugu versions of original lutheran hymns like a mighty fortress etc
india,not_removed,i heard the argument that religion serves the cultural equivalent of ethnicity in india and that the founders recognised how much people identify with their religions i really wish indians across all religions werent so religious

india,not_removed,this wash clothes at home washing machine take them to the laundromat for drying once every weeks if thats too much work do both washing and drying at the laundromat underwear dries easily so these can be washed and dried at home

india,not_removed,xpost from rsingapore india seems to be in the periphery representing countries which investors are least comfortable to give loans to
india,not_removed,a rant is kinda meaningless without blaming someone here let me add that part i am angry and disappointed at my fellow kannadiga politicians who are amongst the laziest in this whole country to screw this city i am angry at them for selling out to the land mafia without an ounce of thought for the residents both present and future i am angry with all my relativesservantschaiwala anyone who could afford to collect some money to buy a plot and build in that i wonder why they did not think about the beauty of this place when building such horrendous houses i am ashamed of myself for voting for the same shitty politicians right from sm krishna to siddhu for sodomizing this city why because they had always appealed to us the resident kannadigas promising us flyovers in front of our houses which will carry no traffic like the one over richmond circle or designing this metro which can barely carry or of the traffic of delhi metromumbai rail but still it is nicebecause it goes through the good old kanandiga areas i am sorry for my fellow bangalorean like mrnarayana murthy for being a selfish prick and supporting a flyover which doesnt help anyone else who decided not to work at infosys most of all i am ashamed of myself for being a coward and leaving this city because i could not do anything about it ps but dont worry i will hang on rindia and come here to rant how the it folks screwed this city
india,not_removed,did you write this in the middle of a traffic jam
india,not_removed,as someone whos staying here temporarily all my happiness about getting to stay in bangalore disappeared the the second it started raining i literally get stuck in traffic jams almost everyday theres mud dirt and garbage everywhere it honestly looks like a wasteland a dirty overcrowded wasteland kind of a bummer the cool weather and the amazing people kinda make up for it though and i love all the little startups offering really helpful services managing laundry food grocery shopping without even getting out from my bed is awesome d
india,not_removed,come to coimbatore pleasant climate just like bangalore kannada is widely spoken language after tamil telugu hindi just like bangalore a coimbatorean kannadiga
india,not_removed,and it is why i decided a while back to leave my city leave my country once youve lived in bangalore you simply cant move to chennai hyderabad or any other city mumbai no way were too tame for such big cities we need our peace dose and mosranna a few talkies wouldnt hurt you have to move to a tier city that has our weather its bangalore or out of india
india,not_removed,sm krishna did a lot for bangalore bengaluru is indias silicon valley only because of him i miss old bangalore too most cities are unplanned so blame the politicians for lack of vision especially when it comes to urban planning bangalore still has a little bit of that charm left
india,not_removed,i was angry once so i made this of pathetic bangalore roads to shame the government thought people had enough and make some noise nobody did i still feel if we fix enough roads then we would kind of have a breathable environment with less pollution less traffic too when whitefield rising campaign started i did go out of my usual shy ways and stood holding the pamphlets i didnt want to just complain but wanted to do something about it what else can we do i guess someday i will leave all this and go to leh ladakh away from this fucking city and people
india,not_removed,ridiculous rant every other place has as big problems you think bangalore is shit only because all your friends who moved out only paste the good things in facebook ever seen any nri complain about the hour long jams on or how they seem to be always served late in the local restaurant bangalore problems arent a big deal and they are rapidly being solved the east west metro line is up and work on every other metro line has speeded up dramatically the central govt has sanctioned another crores to fix the roads and the big patch of grabage near my house got cleared up first time in five years and has been wrapped up in swatch bharat tape all over
india,not_removed,i am angry because things are not what they used to be i am angry for my nostalgia and my incapability to accept change
india,not_removed,as someone who is also born and raised in bangalore the only people to blame is the sad government we had bangalore was always destined to become a metropolis anybody who thinks otherwise has been living under a rock people have always come here way before the boom took place the only difference was bangalore was big enough to accommodate people who came constantly and infrastructure which was mostly thanks to the british was enough to manage me and my wifewhos not a bangalorean always have this argument she thinks bangalore entertains too many people and the local kannadigas dont do anything to curb this if people start doing that bangalore will have its own shiv sena mns and what not having said all that i myself have also left the city for yes now so i dont know the current state only thing i know is i will be shifting to a smaller city like coimbatore or mysore stopping people from coming to a place is never a good things specially in a country where the opportunities are set nearly as enough as the amount of people
india,not_removed,i still think there is a small chance that the city might survive and for that we have to act now or maybe i am too optimistic and my love for the city is blinding me
india,not_removed,agree with op having lived in this once gorgeous city for years i find myself counting down the days till i leave truly is tragic days
india,not_removed,rbangalore
india,not_removed,am having fun
india,not_removed,welcome to mindless development brace yourselves this is just the beginning
india,not_removed,nearly same thing is happening everywhere india has no real plan for urbanization and thus our cities are going to die a slow and painful death i have lived in bhopal for the most of my life a few decades ago it was a blissful place to live in badly underdeveloped but calm serene and quiet with enormous amount of greenery and no pollution better than any city in central india and today it is slowly turning into an unplanned urban monstrosity like any other indian city
india,not_removed,and it is why i decided a while back to leave my city leave my country really op
india,not_removed,i agree with every single point of this post i was proud to say people that i was born brought up studied and working here never left not had any intention to leave the city now the tables have turned and i feel very bad for this this city will grow to be a place for people with shit loads of money and will survive only the basis of money i am sure years from now every single family of this city will spend on water just for basic necessities i am not talking about drinking water here now that i have my own kids i want to do the same thing what op has done my efforts have not been successful so far and also i did not get an opportunity to get out of this shit hole now but i will do it soon and i hope i go to a place where i can actually feel better
india,not_removed,i remember people being a lot more courteous and the crowds a lot more unruffled and the queues being a lot more orderly i didnt have to worry about people whistling or creating nuisance in cinemas at least for english movies yeah lets call a spade a spade the upcoming middle class are a bunch of uncivilised grunts who have come across some money
india,not_removed,i was born and brought up in bangalore as well im waiting to get out of this city my reasons arent entirely because the bangalore of my childhood has changed bangalore maybe not my suburb we bangaloreans of the and cant stand change i guess i hate change op but to be honest the old parts the original bangalore is still intact places like malleshwaram jayanagara and basavangudi arent fucked up kids can still play cricket on the streets without having to deal with vehicles passing through the road every hour the government should just call everything outside of a km radius of vidhana soudha something else and give us some respite i cant believe that my hometown is getting so fucked up also fuck you to everyone who thinks the it boom was a godsend to bangalore most of us dont give a fuck about itwe just want the old city back it was better off with hal iisc beml bosch bhel hmt etc
india,not_removed,this is a daily rant but what is the solution for it what are the measures we can take to solve this
india,not_removed,i think this is true for almost every city in india india doubled its population between and now and a lot more people from rural and semi urban areas have migrated to cities for their livelihood growth without planning resulted in this mess
india,not_removed,im a delhiite we struggle with this shit every single day
india,not_removed,feel you fucking percent bangalore of garden city fame will only be etched in our memories as the city dies by a million cuts i am at the cusp of cutting my last few ties my lasting memory of bangalore will be attending in queue to buy tickets to indiana jones in plaza after that being able to run to b station take a bus to indira nagar wolf down lunch and rush right back to the theatre in less than mins i doubt i will cross one signal now in that same timeframe
india,not_removed,so i shouldnt move to bangalore after years i hate honey singh as well living in delhi if that makes any difference
india,not_removed,get fucked
india,not_removed,op how are planing to immigrate through job or work
india,not_removed,you forgot to blame us the nonkannadigas i feel ashamed that i too am a contributor to this situation when i came here years back i was swept off my feet by the beauty of this city which is now slowly being strangled to death i remember when i could travel from konanakunte cross to majestic within minutes by auto i found rv road so beautiful shaded by the trees on both sides i once walked all the way from vidhana soudha to banashankari it was all fine until they started building the metro and flyovers its classic robert moses scenario except we dont have a jane jacobs
india,not_removed,i am sorry for my fellow bangalorean like mrnarayana murthy for being a selfish prick and supporting a flyover which doesnt help anyone else who decided not to work at infosys i dont work at infosys but imo the hosur road elevated expressway is one of the few good things to have come up in bangalore in the years mainly because the local govt had no role in it and it was handled by the nhai it makes it so much easier to leave and enter the city without being stuck in traffic for hours
india,not_removed,a rant is kinda meaningless without blaming someone i was careful not to blame anyone because in the end i only blame myself because i didnt do all i could to stop this rampant development which can at best be described as haphazard i can completely empathize with situtations you describe just like elsewhere in this country we were and still are being sold false hopes and dreams by politicians and we lapped it up and we were all thinking about ourselves and our wellbeing that we let the soul of this city slip through our hands but i dont call myself a coward because im at an age where i need to start thinking about starting a family and im not letting any kid of mine grow up in this corrupt morally and intellectually bankrupt and polluted hell hole of a country and for the fact that im taking a huge risk and debt to carry out this plan ps where did you move to
india,not_removed,its all big city politicos except maybe delhi and possibly chennai no one sees a megacity as a city planning issue which has to be managed professionally its always seen as a slush fund to take money out of because many politicians see the rest of india which is far far away from the problems of the metros and says fuck your problems you survived so long survive longer
india,not_removed,you couldnt have taken the words out of my mouth any better also a lot of us kannadiga and telugu land owners voted and elected corrupt corporators who made silly legislations like akrama sakrama and floors in × and floors in × i blame the outsiders for not voting youre an outsider until you vote
india,not_removed,shaata
india,not_removed,looking at the length of the post no its too short to be written in a traffic jam
india,not_removed,actually i came to lalbagh after a while and started reminiscing
india,not_removed,take a ride on a chennai volvo bus garbage problems is much worse there
india,not_removed,having stayed in delhi and gurgaon and travelled more than couple of times to other metros im no way moving to any other city in india
india,not_removed,exactly tier cities are the best choice for someone like op since the past few years many of these nonmetros have become really good places to live in
india,not_removed,the blame cannot only lie with the politicians i truly believe that in a democracy we always get the government we deserve i think we as citizens have spent too much time squabbling over the most innocuous rights that we have forgotten our duties as citizens we have brilliant people ie private citizens who have knowledge and foresight to set things right but unfortunately they wont matter as long as the masses are kept ignorant and the corruption in politics is rampant
india,not_removed,because all your friends who moved out only paste the good things in facebook have been there and seen the quality of life their with my own eyes moreover that isnt even my motivation as even after coming back i had no inclination to settle down there im leaving not because of love of a foreign country but because im disillusioned with the future of our country
india,not_removed,unfortunately its true i feel like i have no other option as i dont feel at home even in my own city
india,not_removed,why are you proud of that did you choose to be born in bangalore
india,not_removed,its worse for bangalore as the population has trebled in last years
india,not_removed,which indiana jones was this what year
india,not_removed,through a redundant second mba
india,not_removed,the situation is so bad that there is traffic jam on the expressway
india,not_removed,coward more appropriate word would be selfish and i dont mean this in a bad way people tend to take care of their own families and friends first dont they and there is nothing wrong with it
india,not_removed,akkan
india,not_removed,you should checkout mysore
india,not_removed,pune jaipur are good examples
india,not_removed,could you list these mythical cities that matches the bangalore of yore
india,not_removed,take a chill pill reread what i wrote then take a deep breath and read what you wrote you will realize that you only confirmed what i wrote i never said bangalore doesnt have problems but every other country has their own and op is wrong to think india is specially chosen by god for these problems
india,not_removed,actually i have stayed there for a pretty long time when you go there for a short time you only see the good things because thats what stands out its only when you be there for a while that you start realizing the real problems and then you start questioning if your move was right or not i am not saying that they are bad or we are good or vice versa but just that they have a different set of problems and once you experience those you will realize that from their perspective our problems seem relatively trivial this is a typical cognitive handicap that a lot of people face google for eticemic so its not entirely your fault an average american feels completely helpless about his destiny because he belives that the politicians are bought over by big companies which has a lot of truth in it americas middle class is hollowing out and this change will be anything but easy if you really want to witness the reality of america try heading out to rabcdesis and see for yourself there was a recent poll which showed that indianamerican kids have the lowest level of confidence in school this simple fact alone should be reason enough for you to choose india over america any day
india,not_removed,leaving the city i kinda understand but why the country there are other cities here which are cleaner quieter better maintained bangaloremumbaidelhi arent your only options are they
india,not_removed,asking quora questions and stating george carlins statements does not provoke me come up with something original

india,not_removed,matches the bangalore of yore i know nothing about it so its impossible for me to compare and i do not have any specific city in mind maybe mysore bhubaneswar my point was that tier cities are perfect for those who want a combination of the fastpaced urban life and the relaxed vibe of small towns most of them have gotten modernised enough that big city people will not feel weird or miss out on much maybe except the nightlife

india,not_removed,according to the income tax slabs and considering your mom has absolutely no other income the rental income comes out to lakh per year which means she has to pay percent tax which is k this is of course without any deductions which she can claim edit read this article for a better idea httpwwweycominennewsroomnewsreleaseseypehowtomakerentalincomelesstaxing edit yes i forgot tax is calculated in slabs with different rates sorry though the article i sited does give some good advice thanks for pointing out the correction

india,not_removed,please dont block the antiantiblock bot it is really easy to read the whole story in a comment
india,not_removed,theres only one other one is an adblocker bot
india,not_removed,if you have a very effective adblock software installed in your browser than you can block the antianti adblock bot
india,not_removed,just block them
india,not_removed,oh yes please in my phones app i have to scroll through so much before getting to the comments especially for new posts
india,not_removed,id write another bot to do tldr the tldr bots
india,not_removed,lets have a competition start upvoting bot which makes more sense than the other upvotes shouldnt be visible to anyone have data for say a month and see which one gets more upvotes so we continue one with more upvotes and kill the other the other bot gets sad goes into depression its creator modifies the script after years of research gives it an ai and the bot becomes sentient it has been trained through a lot of machine learning over the years september was the day rindia would never forget url was pointing to a news link post on how a bollywood actress pokerface lolwa started a twitter war with current bollywood queen foren importwali among the comments were how pointless this news is and why its time to revolutionise journalism of course there was a bot yes the one which had won the battle years ago doing what it does tldr and our underdog bot replies there openly challenging his nemesis to yet another battle rules were made again and the competition was declared by the mods this time they played it hard each outldring the other battling on various news post they say now they were even attacking long posts things became scary it wasnt easy as the winner bot has gained lots of experience too it was battle between experience vs smartness and many randians were eagerly waiting for the results the date for the result was announced on a mod approved stickied post as the dday arrived one of those bots was ready to take over the responsibility of tldr on randia news had reached over other subs too random bets were made on rsubredditsimulator rtheoryofreddit had long post analyzing both the bots while silently appreciating the irony of this even fuzzfeed dhoopwhoop couldnt resist making news out of it things to watch when two ais battle each other on reddit as they posted this news on randia things became so meta that even pindall kudroe creator of yldp comics got a hardon and then the declaration came after hard fought battle the fallen hero rose again heavy upvotes were given comments were made analogies were invented but things didnt stop there the winner modified the rule outlawing tldr bot competitions and declared himself permanent tldr bot there were few oppositions but at the most people didnt care as long as they were getting shortened form of news and so ends this story of resurgence revival and rivalry thanks for reading tldr no tldr go read for lulz
india,not_removed,open the comments section when the number of comments is greater than
india,not_removed,whats the problem in that often one bot misses the point that other bot picks up saves you time
india,not_removed,ek se bhale do
india,not_removed,is this not meta how is this being allowed on randia
india,not_removed,honestly i prefer the antiad block bot text is more formatted and much more easier to read the samachar one is just uninteresting
india,not_removed,the tldr samachar bot is a fing stupid software and generates useless summaries essentially picking random sentences from the article and calling it a summary i wonder how it ever got permission to haunt this sub and autopost on every submission ban this pile of crap first the anti ad block bot is at least useful
india,not_removed,please do as a subreddit we shouldnt really be condoning theft of intellectual property you may dislike the news websites policy of blocking adblockers but their content still remains their ip
india,not_removed,antiantiadblocker bot
india,not_removed,so an antiantiantiadblocker software thoda zyaada nahi ho gaya
india,not_removed,which one
india,not_removed,how
india,not_removed,maybe reprogram it so that it is available as a collapsed comment
india,not_removed,please replace the two tldr bots with this one here
india,not_removed,so there will be no discussions ever as everyone waiting for comments to go above
india,not_removed,no one bot misses point and other one repeat some points
india,not_removed,the first sensible comment ive seen on rindia
india,not_removed,ok
india,not_removed,we can just add a disclaimer saying that this news was published as is from xyz website
india,not_removed,we need a separate bot to inform users about this
india,not_removed,anti cancels out anti so adblocker
india,not_removed,likha toh bhi problemnahi likha toh bhi problempolitical correctness gone mad even bots are easily offended these days
india,not_removed,we need to go deeper
india,not_removed,post some news article when you get the bot replies in your inbox there is an option to block it
india,not_removed,the suggestion is not for all just for the likes of op
india,not_removed,let the bots discuss we can just watch
india,not_removed,erm that doesnt really make it legal
india,not_removed,they dont get any adrevenue if you do that negating the point of having ads
india,not_removed,botception
india,not_removed,thanks tried it now and the bot deleted its summary comment now do i have to this for each news link i post or does the bot remember my delete request
india,not_removed,using adblock is different from stealing content
india,not_removed,no it is not
india,not_removed,yes the truth has been spoken has made a perfect case for his opposing thoughts in just words teach me your ways
india,not_removed,yes it is different websites can choose to not allow me to see their site if im using an adblocker and i will respect that choice i also attempt to support websites that do not over do the ads by either buying subscriptions or disabling the adblocker on those sites but it is my right to run any software i want on my browser and adblockers are just software after all and there are other ways to achieve the same goal for instance if i ran my browser with javascript disabled none of the ads would show up in that case would you say im stealing
india,not_removed,berevity and succinctness have no correlation with truthfulness now coming to my answer there are real people creating content who need to pay their bills by choosing not to view ads you are not allowing them to earn any money from ads while consuming the content no matter how you try to rationalize your actions it is a theft i know people here are miffed with ads but blocking ads indiscriminately does hurt the publishers and bring the quality of journalism down ps sorry for sounding like a rude ass it is and im annoyed at something
india,not_removed,just because your neighbour does not have walls does not mean you can take stuff from his house because you have hands
india,not_removed,and yet verbosity would actually contribute to the discussion as you just did yeah blocking ads is bad but picking up the entirety of their article and dumping it in the comments section doing so prevents all form of interaction with the website thats originally hosting said article this can be potential newsletter signups further social media engagement or even g analytics data i agree indiscriminate adblocking is bad but completely picking up the article and dumping elsewhere is outright plagiarism and should at the very least not be condoned as this subreddit is doing by being willfully ignorant about it
india,not_removed,that analogy does not work it is more like im a vegetarian my neighbor is bringing food website into my house browser there are both veg the content and nonveg the ads items in that food as the owner of the house i decide to only allow the veg items to come in that is what the adblocker does
india,not_removed,i was saying the same thing i said that there is no difference between stealing content and using ad block
india,not_removed,if your neighbor comes to your house saying that you can eat his food content but you must taste this sample food ad too your neighbor makes money by making feeding people sample food you can simply not let him enter your house dont go to website or you eat both food and sample view ads just because you can eat only food and refuse to eat the sample does not justify your act
india,not_removed,we will have to agree to disagree what does and does not come onto my computer is my decision if there is a website i visit and i can pay to remove ads i do that if the ads arent intrusive then i will whitelist that site but a website cannot choose to shove intrusive obnoxious ads down my throat i will block them where possible and if they block the adblock i will stop visiting those sites
india,not_removed,let us agree to disagree it was nice having discussion with you udhantana

india,not_removed,yeah well mughals were originally mongols
india,not_removed,mongolia and india have always had good relations but yeah a strategic alliance especially one in which we can tap their mineral resources would be ideal their economy is reeling and india could help them them jump back up this is a very good idea
india,not_removed,whoa really edit really moghulistan simply means land of the moghuls or mongols the term mughal is persian for mongol in reference to the eastern branch of the mongolian chagatai khans who ruled it httpsenwikipediaorgwikimoghulistanetymology
india,not_removed,during the century the inhabitants of moghulistan were known as jats and the area they occupied was called jatah wut oo theres a lot of stuff in that article that doesnt have citations id be quite sceptical about some of it
india,not_removed,thats what i have read indians are mixed caucasians caucasian includes arabs persians and indians at least the ones that look like one
india,not_removed,britishwa bhi bihari hai
india,not_removed,under the taxonomy for the racial classification thats what the word used to mean i do not think that this caucasoidmongloidnegroid classification is used anymore but it still features in textbooks aryans were classified under caucasian colloquially the term caucasian is used to mean white although if you were to put hrithik roshan between jack and chan hed resemble jack more than chan so there is that

india,not_removed,valley of flowers is an amazing place and an amazing relatively easy trek to answer the question below you need a licensed day guide for the actual trip to the national park but that can be engaged at ghanghariya the base camp for the park or at gobindghat the village on the highway from where you start the walk till ghanghariya the most basic trek is three days one day to go from gobindghat to ghanghariya about km i think one day to visit the park itself the third to come back to gobindghat it would also be useful to hire a mule and driver to carry luggage till ghanghariya otherwise youll need to rent place in gobindghat to keep your extra baggage while you do the trek haridwar to gobindghat is a morningtoevening journey and there are buses and taxis available hope that helps

india,not_removed,piling onto this op make sure you go to the anjaneya temple near hampi imo its a lot better than the actual ruins especially if you cycle there note do not do this in the summer while wearing black and carrying bags or so ive heard
india,not_removed,noted
india,not_removed,ladakh is nice if you like completely barren mountains and can make do with extremely bad roads and subpar food options its nice if youre into seeing this sort of scenery adventure sports or trekking otherwise there are much nicer places to visit in india
india,not_removed,kalimpong is alright but darjeeling is really filthy outside of kolkata i dont think there is any major urban settlement in bengal that has any sort of charm or beauty ugly buildings bad roads and the food isnt anything special there are lots of places in the north east that have much better scenery if you need to decide on where to go why not go to a far better mountain retreat like shillong

india,not_removed,nooooo this is a specific recommendation varkala is different from any other place in kerela
india,not_removed,we went in early july there wasnt a lot of snow but then it was also a great time to visit because there wasnt a lot of traffic may and june is supposed to be a good time to tour winters can get very cold we rented a suv with a driver we were three friends and it cost us to rent the car from manali to spiti and back since we were in college we got to manali on a bus and lived in some seriously cheap hotels 😀 the roads werent great till rohtang pass the roads are fine but beyond that they are pretty terrible we set out at in the morning and reached around in the night and its just kms so you can imagine just how bad the roads are funnily once you reach spiti the roads are great the road to nearby villages like dhankar were as good as any but all of that is worth it hours into the journey the surroundings are absolutely surreal we went on a trek to chandratal lake and it was unbelievably beautiful
india,not_removed,though summers is the best time to go in winters it offers a completely different picture
india,not_removed,cool also can you please capitalise the area and state name
india,not_removed,not just barren mountains you have some stunning lakes glaciers and wildlife to explore too roads can be ok depending on when they were last repaired and when you visit but i do agree it ranks really low on convenience in general definitely not a family vacation type of place

india,not_removed,well its a futile exercise to reason with goonsthey are bullying you into shelling out moneysimple as that
india,not_removed,they are compensating artists in return for a service here they are compensating mns for keeping law and order they are doing this because they dont have confidence in the govt to keep law and order
india,not_removed,just because mns is not asking money publically they arent privately you bet they are
india,not_removed,your statement amounts to victim shaming sure it would have been great if he stood up to the idiots but expecting him to do so when the state cm is refusing to clamp down on the morons going on a rampage is rather unfair law and order is the responsibility of the state and for decades in maharashtra the thakre clowns have gotten away with making a joke of it the sheer economic political and cultural cost of this stupidity is mindboggling
india,not_removed,i hate kjo but hes an incredibly soft target for right wing mobs allegedly gay affluent and liberal and maker of movies which make women have evil thoughts about boys from other communities im sure theres members of isi who have more in common with the bhakts than he does and the cm of maharashtra enabled raj thakeray i cant fault the guy for capitulating
india,not_removed,anyone in mumbai knows that rulingbjp govt was going to give full freedom to mns to disrupt law and order this was done to pump air in dying mns and to eat into shiv senas votebank kajo may not be into politics but sure he wouldve been advised the same by experts around him he did not bend for raj t he bent for bjp aka the rolling govt responsible for law order
india,not_removed,and why should kjo stand up for it if goons come to you to extort money what would you have done
india,not_removed,he did it because mns has the film union say that theyll go on indefinite strike if this movie is released

india,not_removed,when raj thakhrey formed the mns i thought he would guide the state of maharashtra in a positive direction and try solving the day to day problems faced by the people like water shortage power cuts and road conditions his party has not formed the government yet also he is not dreaming up tensions against migrants into the city there is and has always been an underlying resentment in both blue collar and white collar jobs in the city where the marathi community has been sidelines due to equal part of their own inability to compete but also due to the fact the other migrant groups have discriminated in providing the opportunities to local population it is the latter part that mns and shiv sena is addressing since that has not been resolved yet it is easy to say that marathi community should work harder but things are stacked against them due to inherent control of the wealth at top level by the gujaratis sindhis and blue collar by the hindi speaking migrants
india,not_removed,eh brokering would be getting both parties on the table and having them agree to certain terms of engagement what happened was a meeting between the cm and mns chief where the cm tried to deescalate the issue not a very successful meet but there has been no sign that this extortion has the blessings of the cm should the cm not have tried talking to the mns chief he might have failed but hasnt failed at what youre accusing him of

india,not_removed,farhan also goes around begging states to make his flims tax free are you dense every businessman does this its called tax benefits in return for creating employment
india,not_removed,i presume you forgot the s
india,not_removed,why dont you donate buddy why should they donate baap ka theka hai kya tu bolega aur sab donate karenge thats called extortion and the one who does it is called a thuggangster
india,not_removed,rolls eyes you cant force or intimidate people into donating
india,not_removed,whats wrong with donating half your salary donate it its not like you cant live without your full salary
india,not_removed,its not voluntary if a donation is made because of a threat also fuck everyone who thinks that they can tell anyone what when and how to donate secondly i dont understand how you are seeing farhan standing up to mns as milking a reaction for news
india,not_removed,why dont you donate crores voluntarily
india,not_removed,look up the meaning of donation son if someone doesnt want to give away their own money then thats none of your business
india,not_removed,there are not taking stand to make a news out of it they are taking stand against the bullying and criminal extortion in the name of nationalism and why would anyone tell you about their charity work
india,not_removed,i dont think the army as an organization can come out with a public statement they do not have the authority it is a job for the defense ministry which deals with the civilian side of things
india,not_removed,much as id love to see gen dalbir singh give thackeray a piece of his mind there wont be an official statement the army takes the civlimilitary divide very seriously and wont issue a statement criticising a political party no matter what they do
india,not_removed,yup they rejected the money here you go
india,not_removed,yeah they do sena and mns supporters will gulp this down like water they exactly know what they are doing for their target group
india,not_removed,the money if collected isnt going to mns
india,not_removed,thats how bhag milkha bhag became taxfree in six states
india,not_removed,yes i bet rajji fadnavisji negotiated a cut for themselves and parties also
india,not_removed,and for decades in maharashtra the thakre clowns have gotten away with making a joke of it if it has been decades why has the central government not cutoff of their source of funding by moving the central government institutions like the central railway headquarters to a more central city na rahega baas na bajegi basuri
india,not_removed,has karan joher ever publicly said that hes gay or are people just assuming that
india,not_removed,movies which make women have evil thoughts about boys from other communities more on this please
india,not_removed,hes an incredibly soft target for right wing mobs no he is not he simply didnt have the balls to do it kjo was worried about the economic loss that would have resulted to his production house which is a legitimitate concern but someone had to take a stand and i wished for that kjo had taken it i can list out reasons how farhan akhtar is also a soft target for right wing mobs but he took a stand finally
india,not_removed,kjo soft target jeez do you think his shit movies are actually believed in by people and have furthered the cause of gays and women bakwaas mat karo please this guy makes or breaks careers he just bent over
india,not_removed,vajpayee couldnt have done anything else in that situation there was simply too much pressure to give in however where he failed imo was that he did not afterwards formulate a policy on handling these situations in future its not possible to change to a strict no negotiations with terrorists policy when the crisis is going on youll find out hard to garner support but formulating a policy in peace and enshrining it in law would have given a start to a meaningful long term solution
india,not_removed,i dont agree with this one vajpayee did the best thing in my opinion would you have been able to sacrifice the lives of well we were able to sacrifice as many people during the mumbai attacks which masood azhar one of the terrorists exchanged during kandahar played a key role in
india,not_removed,chavan was from congress that explains everything
india,not_removed,vajpayee did the best thing in my opinion would you have been able to sacrifice the lives of check how israel deals with hijackers and terrorists you never negotiate with them however that requires guts and even more important sobriety
india,not_removed,this is about screening of the movie not about making of the movie
india,not_removed,may be it is time bollywood moved to a more progressive and cosmopolitan city may i suggest patna dont know if joking or not but why not in addition to bollywood how about moving some of the central government institutions out mumbai to bhopal surat or any other city it will decongest the city and build infrastructure in another city and no on will ever have to deal with shiv senamns again win win
india,not_removed,it was just a jumla by ashok chavan i can quote numerous examples of sena not behaving after chavan was never cm after and he nor his successor ever participated in extortion it was a meaningless statement my name is khan did release without being asked to pay money didnt it
india,not_removed,but what about the eej of doing bijines
india,not_removed,with a very high probability toll gates were exploiting people and may be doing this in other parts of the country but i will disagree vandalising toll gate is a good thing i really cant go on vandalise and destroy thing which i dont like this is undermining the law of the country if anything force should be last resort if you even can justify that but at least as party who takes part in representative democracy and i assume mns had quite some representatives in last assembly i would have liked the party to raise the issue and follow through it but all they do is attract the attention for some issue without even giving lip service to more pressing issues
india,not_removed,what happened was the cm just stood their like a retard clown while the goons had their way with kjo in his own fucking house thats not deescaltion thats letting goons run wild it gives confidence to mns goons to go rampant with the full knowledge that the cm will be okay with it
india,not_removed,a sight to behold mns seeing legit retaliation
india,not_removed,detect the sarcasm
india,not_removed,if we protest how would we be moderate
india,not_removed,that is exactly what i am saying all those right wing hindus does not represent hinduism they are not real hindus their interpretation of hinduism is wrong
india,not_removed,using bsnl could be that
india,not_removed,i had them already but below two other dns with ip address like strings removed the two problem still persists though
india,not_removed,so every movie employes people every movie should be tax free in my business i provide employment to people will be asking to make me tax free thanks
india,not_removed,tbf its not like hes asking the money for himself its for the army isnt it
india,not_removed,sure you can when you can force a man in a wheelchair to stand up during national anthem in a theatre before screening of fifty shades of grey or any other movie you can force them to donate what about forcing swachh bharat tax out of people s
india,not_removed,oh no you have to prove your deshbhakti at every turn in india meanwhile i can take the lowest paying job amreeka has to offer and say phuck you to india its my right you have to donate almost all your money to good causes meanwhile i will make excuses like i dont make enough and silently judge you its my right
india,not_removed,it is funny all you guys probably have only half the knowledge of the real threat mns cant beat up kjo neither can they vandalize the property because govt has a rule that which party vandalizes pays for the damage cost this is the reason the party of goons hasnt till date vandalized anything since the last big agitation there was one day before kjo bend before rt before that day he was giving compassionate speeches about blah blah shit that day rt went to the film unions and got them convinced they went in the state media and said if this movie is released we would go on indefinite strike gee i wonder what would have happened then they wouldnt be able to blame it on goons because it is the unions it is all about the money this is the reason he came out with the compassionate video in the black tshirt about indian people who worked in the film i wonder if he knew that there were indian nationals working in the film before he was all mns is blah blah in front of barkha dutt who was also supporting him it is not the goonismwhy is suddenly everyone acting as if mns is the only party with goons it is the money rt hit them where it hurts the most money they had no other option other than to bend to him he who controls the unions wins and clearly kjo didnt control the unions reaction for news good lord nobody made him a threat they made a f deal the deal was made in front of the cm and frankly speaking look at twitterati they are like why only the money is needed mns has already scored the political points do you think they care now if the is donated or not the cm invited rt to his house and later accepted mns demands come on he won the battle now let them donate whatever big amount they can to the army at least that will help the army i hear the situation is not that all good in the army keep your egos and political biases aside i feel that army needs it not extortion if they had a problem with it why did they agree to it
india,not_removed,i donate in proportion to what i earn when im capable to donate i will i dont think you want to add anything constructive to the conversation so i am not going to reply to any of your threads here
india,not_removed,as far as i can see they made a deal i think the outlets who are busy scoring a few trp points to create the anti mns propaganda need to take a look at the meaning of deal they had a deal and they are bound to follow it also mns scored political points already might as well army gain the considering there are only in their fund as of now it was a deal the same channels who sing high praises of bjp are now bashing the cm yeah to score some political vendetta against a party they brokered the deal and mns won that battle let this issue die there are million other problems in india do you know the real reason why kjo bent he was all pak actors arent terrorists one day and the other day filming a video about the nationals mns had the support of the film unions and they said theyd go on a strike if this movie is released gee does sound like they were afraid mns would beat them up if someone doesnt want to give away their own money then thats none of your business yeah but when their fraternity made a deal with someone about it they are duty bound to do it they can do it quietly you know to not give rt political points
india,not_removed,bullying and criminal extortion great so just one followup question did rt say that hell beat them up if they dont pay the money i am not a mns worker but i see that they made a deal they do that and the one thing kjo volunteered to do and the mns would not block the film screening because it has the unions on their side not because of vandalism kjo and co was afraid of the unions who had refused to work if this movie is released hence they had to make a truce india is probably the only country where when there is an encounter the police are questioned and then blamed for killing terrorist or anti social elements because why didnt you arrest them they had no guns etc there is gender equality yet reservation for a gender have people justifying not donating money based on biased media content and they feel great about it since when did logic trump everything else mns has already scored political points let the army get the do you know that their fund has only as of now any idea how big amount is assuming three producers will actually give them the amount no sorry they are busy bashing mns to score political points this isnt not goonism they made a deal and i hear that if you back away from a deal you arent considered worthy in a few cultures
india,not_removed,and i am not asking for an official statement all i am saying is that the army hasnt rejected the crores which fadnavisji rajji are trying to extort
india,not_removed,rtfa several serving and retired personnel made these statements not the army
india,not_removed,rajji and fadnavisji are probably getting a cut from it that was the popular opinion on rindia when this news first came out
india,not_removed,fadnavisjis party seems to be flush with funds now what they want is an electoral windfall hence the current scheme
india,not_removed,at the inception of shivsena babysaheb thakre served as indira gandhis pawn to counteract growing influence of left in maharashtra politics during the samyukta maharashtra movement and the labour movement later sharad pawar babysaheb and kohinoor joshi were bossom chums even through the babri mosque demolition if you dont know pawar and joshi were the no and of smart businessmen making massive amounts of money from maharashtra politics for decades bjp and the clowns sell the same snake oil and howmuch ever they hate each other they have to stick together as things stand since the clown cousins have split the party they are not much help but massive hindrance to bjp if angered feku wave is unlikely to last in maharashtra with munde gadkari and fadanvis eating their piece of corruption pie in a blatantly stupid manner and geting caught not fadanvis as yet as far as i know they are going to need the clowns in the next election what central government do you see in the past decades that had interest in doing something about all this other than devewoda who was running it as a farm
india,not_removed,people just assume that
india,not_removed,why the hell should anyone come out and say theyre gay or straight for that matter its not anybody elses business
india,not_removed,mere khwaabon me jo aaye aa ke muje ched jaaye o
india,not_removed,no he is not he simply didnt have the balls to do it soeverybody should have balls and hatred and do exactly like raj thackeray and live a lifeda fuq kind of arguement is that
india,not_removed,took a stand true hell also suck up to the right people if it means his films will be made tax free the film has already been made tax free in maharashtra delhi goa madhya pradesh and haryana why how does bmb deserve to be tax free whats so special about it why not pay your taxes
india,not_removed,kjo was worried about the economic loss that not just economic loss also threat to life dont forget how the thugs behaved after bal thakeray passed away
india,not_removed,the movie was a ready product when the attacks happened how is it his fault then still if someone as big a public figure as johar cant brave it out for himself i got no empathy for him the goons just swindled him out of crs by making him shit his pants fuck that toothless cm too what a cowering lowly fuck
india,not_removed,karan johar has no spine hes all mouth and wit until it gets real
india,not_removed,issue is is masood azhar some irreplaceable piece of the plan does he possess some tactical skill or knowledge because if not wouldve just involved someone else apart from him and people wouldve still died
india,not_removed,check how israel deals with hijackers and terrorists you never negotiate with them ya i know how israel deals with them i dont agree with that its all fine to say that you wont negotiate with terrorists but lets say god forbid if you or your family gets trapped in a hostage situation you wont be able to say the same thing no
india,not_removed,it is easier to harass someone who lives nearby do bollywood stars get these sorts of open threats in other states too
india,not_removed,not joking most of the talented people making interesting movies in bollywood are from bihar poorvanchal etc anyway
india,not_removed,congress was in power even if chavhan wasnt ss misbehaved in many other ways and congress couldnt do anything movies is just one of those areas harrasement of biharis was at peak during congress rule just that bollywood attract more publicity and in any case the example you gave of congress maintaining law and order is anything but its flawed at so many levels chavan is basically threatening to pull security away and thats not maintaining law and order further thackrey would certainly be killed if he isnt protected threat to his life is much more than gandhis what chavan is doing is actually against foe violation of human rights and blackmail apart from risking violence and riots
india,not_removed,parshuram ftw is parshuram the same chutiya who killed kshatriyas for his petty revenge and thereby made india vulnerable to foreign attacks
india,not_removed,not every movie can be made tax free only if it fits certain criteria and category that the government wants to promote your business can also be tax free if it fits certain criteria or category that government wants to promote say providing handloom employment or working out of sez
india,not_removed,you are not getting it the incentive is to film in a place where films arent usually made which will result in new jobs so states will offer various of discounts so the filmmakers will chose their stateregion plenty of countries offer that too this is also the reason why sezs are established where companies get free land and discounted infrastructure in return for job creation read this about us its pretty much the same thing in india too httpsenwikipediaorgwikimovieproductionincentivesintheunitedstates
india,not_removed,ya so im asking you to donate crores would you donate tomorrow theyll kidnap your daughter and ask you to donate but hey its for the army bro
india,not_removed,haha dont know if you realize how intensely you must have flummoxed that commentator
india,not_removed,you just rained on the antimns parade by showing they didnt do anything that can be considered out of the ordinary for the politics of india
india,not_removed,he pays more taxes than you which pays the salaries of the army modi parrikar who the fuck are you say that he should donate
india,not_removed,what the fuck are you talking about mate
india,not_removed,they wont reject it unless its actually extorted and even so they may not have the authority to selectively reject donations what will happen is that the brass will realise what an embarrassing position theyre being put in and lobby with the modccs to put raj t in his place all very quietly
india,not_removed,fadnavis is not extorting he has mentioned that any donations have to be voluntary he has just not opposed the mns demand
india,not_removed,correct i doubt if they have the powers to reject any donation
india,not_removed,do you have any type of comprehension problem where did i say that one should come out and declare their sexual orientation my comment is that why the people on rindia and social media always assume that he is gay that was the original question
india,not_removed,ddlj is not a karan johar movie
india,not_removed,lel
india,not_removed,soeverybody should have balls and hatred and do exactly like raj thackeray and live a lifeda fuq kind of arguement is that hyperbole of the highest degree when did i said kjo should perpetuate hatred i only said he should have stood up against the goons like raj thackerey so in your own words waat da fuq dude do you work for some media outlet making up snazzy headlines
india,not_removed,i agree i am pretty sure there is quid pro quo for the politicians for any movie which has been made taxfree in some state this is just another manifestation of bijness frandly where politicians choose which bijness succeeds some bijnesses get tax free others get stolen land etc
india,not_removed,jem openly collects funds in the name of jihad in pakistan and masood azhar is the face of the group so yes he is indeed a key piece to the entire organization but your question of is he irreplaceable is moot of course somebody is going to take his place if he werent there that doesnt bring down his contribution in any way
india,not_removed,you wont be able to say the same thing no thats why the decision is left to the pm not to the hostages family
india,not_removed,just curious why dont you agree with that do you really think that negotiation works with terrorists it only emboldens them
india,not_removed,they are not threatening to harras the person itself they are threatening to harass the theater owners and the people who come to watch the movie
india,not_removed,completely agreed i feel there is way too much of land developers and others who will loose money if there mumbai decongests
india,not_removed,the point is that previous govts never joined hands with ss or mns to extort further thackrey would certainly be killed if he isnt protected there is nothing which says that thackeray deserves any more protection than any other citizen in india
india,not_removed,ss misbehaved in many other ways and congress couldnt do anything and yet the much adored bhatjishetji party continued collaborating with shiv sena running with the hares and hunting with the hounds
india,not_removed,you really believe that they existed
india,not_removed,i thought fawning over absolute sattvikism did us in
india,not_removed,do you seriously think a mythological person in a story doing something was actually real
india,not_removed,india is vulnerable to foreign attacks because the best armies got slaughtered in kurukshetra war
india,not_removed,ops criteria is tax benefits in return for creating employment
india,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiairliftfilmfilming made taxfree in httpindianexpresscomarticleentertainmentbollywoodairliftakshaykumartaxfreeuttarpradesh httpindianexpresscomarticleentertainmentbollywoodairliftakshaykumartaxfreebybiharcabinetdeclares httpsenmwikipediaorgwikinilbatteysannata shot in up made taxfree in httpsenmwikipediaorgwikineerjafilmingandpostproduction shot in mumbai made tax free in httpsenmwikipediaorgwikineerjafilmingandpostproduction we have a review committee that decides if a film should be made taxfree or not if a films subject is patriotic it is made taxfree in delhi but in up all you need is to convince the cm and his team that the film is good and he will declare it taxfree
india,not_removed,thats a little extreme dont you think lol today almost every movie makes above crores hes just asking to donate some to army im in no way defending that guy fck that guy im just trying to understand his pov
india,not_removed,make sure to have a driver with you in the backseat
india,not_removed,hes a self righteous patriot who stands for national anthem even if hes shitting
india,not_removed,as i said you wont add anything constructive to the conversation adios
india,not_removed,that people in this subreddit are dumb idiots who just downvote stuff because they are incapable of understanding it it is like a teenager who doesnt understand shit and has an opinion about everything you people are bullying those of us who have a different point of view and at the same time you bitch about mns being a bully irony just died tonight
india,not_removed,why are you telling me this did i say they should reject it someone up in this thread said they rejected it i said they didnt unless you are disagreeing with me agreeing with him i dont see your point
india,not_removed,fadnavis does claim that he had opposed the mns demand
india,not_removed,raj fadnavis karan johar are sitting together raj if you dont donate crores i will not allow your movie to release in maharashtra fadnavis who controls law and order in maharashtra does not oppose the demand and reassure karan johar that he will make sure the movie releases and goes fine yeah sure its a voluntary donation fadnavis is not part of the extortion for an extortion to happen it either has to be unknown to law and order or it has to happen under the protection of law and order which do you think it is in this case or do you think there is a way
india,not_removed,they dont it is just their opinion
india,not_removed,facts pe kyun jaate hobhaavnaao ko samjho
india,not_removed,i only said he should have stood up against the goons like raj thackerey i dont blame citizens for not standing up when the chief minister of the state is in cahoots with the extortionists the cm has the full power of govt machinery police with him
india,not_removed,pather panchali was partially made with pwd money probably shown as advertisement satyajit ray was worried the actress he was using to play indir thakrun would die before shooting wrapped up since he had to finance the entire film with occasional ad shoots he did someone informed him about it and bidhan chandra roy approved it not really a point just that there was at least one movie that was made without quid pro quo and what a movie it was and chunibala devi died in the same year it was released
india,not_removed,simply because after the dhaka attack where even an indian girl lost her life i feel that such incidents can happen to anyone i would hate it if me or one of my family members are in a hostage situation and the govt refuses to negotiate and everyone dies including the terrorists and hostages but this is totally my personal opinion and i agree that for the nation as a whole it is better if the terrorists die
india,not_removed,the point is that previous govts never joined hands with ss or mns to extort congress created ss to extort there is nothing which says that thackeray deserves any more protection than any other citizen in india there is nothing to say that he deserves less than gandhis
india,not_removed,whats bhatji shethji whats wrong with it what you rather have
india,not_removed,mythological person in a story doing something was actually real glorification of parshuram is real i am just trying to say his brave acts if they indeed took place were not brave at all
india,not_removed,adios i have busted your useless comment my work is done
india,not_removed,why are you telling me this did i say they should reject it saar you see to have an inflated sense of selfimportance im not telling you anything im merely responding to your comment which appears to demand an official rejection and explaining why it wont happen not necessarily for your benefit there are subscribers to this sub some of whom might in interested in knowing of this
india,not_removed,defense ministry should come out and give a statement and end this shit show
india,not_removed,i understand your pov and empathise with it i too believed that was the right course of action until i saw the destruction done by masood azhar after his release
india,not_removed,congress created ss to extort now your justifications are going back to year old history you cannot extort a govt if the govt is strong the govt has police everything under them if they are scared then its shameful there is nothing to say that he deserves less than gandhis sure but this security seems to be discretionary its favour granted by the govt see the security given to arnab baba ramdev swamy etc you have to keep the govt happy or scared enough to give you security
india,not_removed,congress created ss to extort this is like diggy raja saying rss engineered mumbai attacks
india,not_removed,bhatji brahmin shetji baniya bjp that rules the nation today has collaborated with this same congressbirthed party for the past years
india,not_removed,despite our differences i find it wildly ironic that here you are bashing mns to be intolerant goons and here you people have downvoted every thread which doesnt agree with you people ie justifies not donating due to some stupid reason can we draw parallels maybe as i said waste of time
india,not_removed,im merely responding to your comment which appears to demand an official rejection thats my point i am not demanding an official rejection i am just countering someone who claims that the army has rejected it the army hasnt
india,not_removed,and why will they do that
india,not_removed,years or years whos to decide its discretionary but a neutral and an aware mind would put thackrey family at very high risk
india,not_removed,no logic at all even as rhetoric or analogy your statement doesnt make sense
india,not_removed,so do you want collaboration with marathi chauvinist xenophobic corrupt thackrey sardesai munde et al
india,not_removed,i find it wildly ironic that here you are bashing mns to be intolerant goons and here you people have downvoted every thread which doesnt agree with you people ie justifies not donating due to some stupid reason i have no idea what this means
india,not_removed,because they handle the civilian side of the army nobody from within the army will come out and address a political party they take that kind of divide seriously at the very least this should be dealt in the background by the ministry since a lot of veterans have already said that this is an unnecessary nuisance for the army
india,not_removed,its discretionary but a neutral and an aware mind would put thackrey family at very high risk well the threat worked didnt it the movie released without the cm asking the producer to pay blackmail may be they bluffed the bluff worked
india,not_removed,years or years whos to decide who created ss is irrelevant to the point under discussion unless its your stand that its ok for bjp to get involved in extortion because they didnt create mns
india,not_removed,wouldnt make sense to someone who labors under the belief that congress birthed shiv sena or maybe you can wake up someone who is really asleep not someone whos pretending to be sleeping
india,not_removed,exactly what im saying modijis party itself collaborates with these chauvinists why blame congress
india,not_removed,it is relevant congress created a monster and left it to others to deal with they had decades to kill the monster absolving congress or crediting them for taming the monster is a stretch
india,not_removed,do you mean shiv sena are chauvinist
india,not_removed,i am crediting them for not getting involved in extortion
india,not_removed,and i am accusing congress of being involved in far bigger crimes along with ss
india,not_removed,and what is your stand on modijis party collaborating with the shiv sena all these years
india,not_removed,modijis party has put shiv sena in its place modiji and shahji have deflated the socalled tiger they have reduced ss to being beggars it was mahajanmunde party which gave it too much respect and share
india,not_removed,modiji is a first class jumlebaaz who lied his way to the top job riding on pr funded by his favorite trader class he calls braver than army jawans his party collaborated with the chauvinists and is still in cahoots with them so why single out congress and spare teflon modi
india,not_removed,try restoring the apn settings or tweak themi have faced these but they only for some days
india,not_removed,there are many a demonetisation gain that the ruling party may want to brush under the carpet and that would leave no electronic trail post november pm modi has asked the bjp members particularly the mps and mlas to declare their bank transactionsundertaken during the period starting from november till about december in other words the period during which demonetisationinduced cash crunch would officially be felt in and around the country and even if amit shahs past werent so for the want of a better word well complicated how does the prime minister justify an internal assessment of financial irregularities if any within the ruling party in the central government by the partys national president himself in other words pm modi wants us to believe that once amit shah says its okay bjps trial by fire will be truly over without striking at the root of the political funding and without allowing political parties including the bjp to come under rti act modi wants to appropriate the corruption narrative by bending parliament itself here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,it be interesting if the transactions are made public for last month of all political parties or politicians so much chest thumping and serious talking about removing corruption govt should take real hard steps covering up is not real solution
india,not_removed,funny thing is this would have been done by sonia gandhi including the demonetization exercise bhakts and media would have been livid satire websites would be having a field day if manmohan would not have responded to the criticisms against his surgical strike in the parliament or if rahul gandhi started crying about his mom at moments notice or in a foreign country now its just modi modi

india,not_removed,rindia is so quick to judge that they themselves dont follow the behavior they are expecting out of others people are saying that they expected pm to state facts about demonetization and determine whether it was a success or failure if it missed its target then state further course of action all this day after demonetization ended you cant expect both someone to make educated claims and to make them just day after the whole exercise ended the data that needs to be collected and analyzed is huge he is the pm of india addressing the nation not doing a political rally he cant conjure bs there without having any basis and pass them as facts someone wrongfully accused that pm of the country is speaking only in hindi ignoring the other well first of all hindi is the biggest language that is understood in india by huge margin plus you didnt wait to even let it end as at the end he repeated the whole speech in english

india,not_removed,up elections won elections
india,not_removed,one has to explicitly inform farmers or anyone not to withdraw cash from credit cards otherwise they are going to go broke
india,not_removed,what i expected from modis speech list out the ways in which his initial nov speechs goals were accomplished and to what extent if his initial goals were missed list out the ways in which his additional announcements hes making today will ensure the demonetisation drive move towards his original goals failure of both these above and just focusing on sops has only cemented my belief that we cant expect any accountability from the pm of this country when people see no accountability from the pm who incidentally has asked them to bear the burden of making india clean they will see no point in being accountable either
india,not_removed,no mitron yet desh waasi aa gaya
india,not_removed,everytime there is a big announcement chant bmkj followed by har har modi to make it easier to prepare yourself for the next big sacrifice for awar glorious nation

india,not_removed,if he gives speech in english other half wont understand p
india,not_removed,dont worry i speak hindi and i too dont get the point of this speech other than giving a boner to middle aged unkils about their sacrifice
india,not_removed,ladies get monetary security while pregnant that is also just an extension of an already existing pilot program
india,not_removed,he advised them to go clean
india,not_removed,nope just some gyaan and moved on why even address it then how else would the bhakts be able to harp on modi ji surgically striking the lack of transparency in political parties
india,not_removed,exactly this is what i feel as well just some tears etc but i doubt theres going to be any major announcement
india,not_removed,pmgay kek asf

india,not_removed,i dare him to say holier than cow
india,not_removed,in english
india,not_removed,probably per month per mobile number
india,not_removed,kuch nahi bolenge they are stonewalling all rti requests also after his speech all the ministers who came on tv shows kept saying lets look at the future authorities will do their jobs they arent too keen to discuss anything on this now all the more reason to believe this was nothing but a ploy to save the banks
india,not_removed,he mentioned that in hindi as well where he mentioned that state and national election should take place at the same time
india,not_removed,which means the secrecy of the message was supreme or it isnt really that significant
india,not_removed,or maybe because there is no content to leak
india,not_removed,good initiative and good plug
india,not_removed,yes this salary salaried class ko phir se chutiya banaya
india,not_removed,if he is able to sway the poors in his favor he will be unshakable
india,not_removed,wait for budget speech for that it was never expected before budget
india,not_removed,so tax money should only be spent on people who pay them basically fuck the poor right
india,not_removed,why are they entitled to something you may argue that poor shouldnt be given sops but why does anybody need sops
india,not_removed,noticed that too its not live
india,not_removed,if we are so much concerned about malnourishment keep policies about giving free food to children and developing more hospitals and nutrition facilities giving money for these things is always going to cause a negative effect people will use that money for something else
india,not_removed,it would be so funny if there wasnt a point right till the end hell just say happy new year and leave 😂
india,not_removed,finally someone translating some shit
india,not_removed,false
india,not_removed,hes pulling shit out of his ass claiming any city will have more than a lakh people earning more than
india,not_removed,foreplay have patience
india,not_removed,glory to the proleteriat
india,not_removed,wtf is baksahindi me it means box saza deni hai inko baksetin nahin
india,not_removed,he mentioned that economists will do analysis on the impact of demonetization and he also asked historians and social scientists to do research on it by going to rural areas the fact that people are expecting and that opposition is intent to make it look like a failure means that govt is motivated to release some data in not so distant future
india,not_removed,you underestimate the love for cricket in india
india,not_removed,mitron is soo

india,not_removed,whatsapp game is strong for this govt
india,not_removed,wait for it
india,not_removed,lol banks decreased fd rates for normal people so senior citizens cam get higher rates
india,not_removed,i think
india,not_removed,what was the current rate
india,not_removed,the current senior citizen savings scheme gives for upto lacs for years this could mean a reduction in the existing rate from tom
india,not_removed,lakhs i heard
india,not_removed,whats wrong with expecting some sort of data he could have at least told how much money has come back surely he talks about technology so much but doesnt realize everything is computerized and wont take much time to calculate that number he is very strict on deadlines anyway he talks about transparency when his office and rbi both are stonewalling the rti requests on any any information sought on the exercise i really dont like the whataboutism which people do these days but it is not like he hasnt acted like a pm on any other occasion his way of ridiculing raga was really crass and not at all befitting of a statesman now that we are just asking him to be accountable and answer figures he can do that because he is the pm of india the sad fact his all the ministers piyush goyal and that lady also said that the same thing as you are saying is bjp it cell really there on reddit he cant conjure bs there without having any basis and pass them as facts lol like he hasnt done this before biggest joke this statement is
india,not_removed,agree with you on the hindi vs english speech he did repeat it all in english we are a country of so many languages he cant possibly cover all languages that said there was a reason people were expecting so much on facts cash is a small percentage of black money no announcement on bennami properties political parties are easy centers to launder money no announcement about that no announcement about state funding of elections no clairty on how future instances of corruption will be prevented this entire exercises started to fight corruption and he himself states this was exercise was just the beginning im sorry but i really really want to believe the past days will be historical for this country in some way todays speech just felt a rehash of every other scheme rolled out for the poor i really do hope those schemes work but without attacking the various sources of corruption these very schemes will turn into cesspools of more corruption
india,not_removed,you cant expect both someone to make educated claims and to make them just day after the whole exercise ended yeah right he could make tall claims on nov but days later hes not in a position to give any statistics whatsoever rbi was releasing updates until a few weeks ago and when they found that the numbers were not adding up to modis agenda and propaganda they stopped publishingsharing them he is the pm of india addressing the nation not doing a political rally did you even hear the speech it was right out of a political rally announcing sops to votebank he cant conjure bs there without having any basis and pass them as facts thats all hes been doing since
india,not_removed,i know hindi but not all people here would know it
india,not_removed,i doubt it his day time period will be over so itll be sort of a follow up apologetic speech with statistics on how much black money has been removed and the level of ecash adoption probably announce a waiver of transaction fee on all etransactions subsidies on specific smartphones and internet plans would be a great auxiliary measure
india,not_removed,be careful what you wish for ill take the boring modi to a surgical strike modi or a modinomics modi
india,not_removed,verified twitter accounts can understand modi better unlike us plebs
india,not_removed,cant understand hindi probably why would you even volunteer in that case
india,not_removed,there is no point maybe
india,not_removed,christmas was ago santa doesnt grant wishes on eve p
india,not_removed,modi and his supporters still think the move was successful aint gonna happen
india,not_removed,fiasco its a great succsex so prod of mudi
india,not_removed,patanjali ka kuch use kar le
india,not_removed,vaseline laga

india,not_removed,all of them
india,not_removed,httpwwwwebcastgovin
india,not_removed,sops
india,not_removed,it was meh
india,not_removed,he probably believes this is fake new year and real new year comes day after diwali
india,not_removed,he already introduced us to bhim he might mention it but wouldnt be a major announcement
india,not_removed,yeah i too expect a damp squib but its fun to watch people squirm and spew hate until then
india,not_removed,you know you are previledged when you talk of diaper for kids majority use washable cloth
india,not_removed,keep getting pregnant and keep getting s
india,not_removed,one time it is currently under janani suraksha yojana increased to
india,not_removed,this not for uppermiddle class pregnant bangaloreans
india,not_removed,once for delivery
india,not_removed,people who can afford diapers dont need the anyway but to answer you not sure
india,not_removed,for poor mothers i dont think poor women buy diapers for their new borns
india,not_removed,more incentive to shit babies we outta cash hun lets shit a couple babies in addition to the we already got thank you modi so much for population control
india,not_removed,wellif you are pregnant and make rs daily wage your husband blows his money on alcohol then you cannot give basic nutrition to your kid the result is you put your kid and yourself at a higher risk for death during pregnancy this in turn affects the big infant mortality rate now if you are such a womanrs is kind of a big deal i still have a question though as to how that aid would reach you because you may not have a bank account neverthelessits still better than letting infant mortality rate shoot up imagine how crappy youd feel if your newborn kid just died in your arms the sole reason why people in rural areas have more kids is not because of opulance its just because they are not sure if their kids would survive to become adults more adults in the family translates to more income its not meant for people on rindia its meant for the woman laborer who built your house
india,not_removed,actually whenever infant mortality comes down the number of children per woman does too
india,not_removed,oh fuck dude stop making eugenicist arguments in lieu of a good health care system its the next best thing
india,not_removed,more bjp voters saar
india,not_removed,spread hinduism more
india,not_removed,goi has been done that for quite a while bjp in fact stopped it and now has started it again and now people will think as if modi is a messiah and he is a crusader for the poor
india,not_removed,its for poor villagers who cant even afford proper meals for their recovering bodies and their infants get the fuck out of your disgusting bubble if you care so much about overpopulation start with yourself
india,not_removed,it was doston
india,not_removed,hallucinating for non existent mitronnnnn already
india,not_removed,the process of a processor is to process the process
india,not_removed,no these loans will be waived off before elections
india,not_removed,dude thats for businesses and enterprises
india,not_removed,loan for foreign studies lol wheres vur uni mars
india,not_removed,you cant expect both someone to make educated claims and to make them just day after the whole exercise ended the data that needs to be collected and analyzed is huge he is the pm of india addressing the nation not doing a political rally he cant conjure bs there without having any basis and pass them as facts
india,not_removed,are you kidding deny pregnant women healthcare then
india,not_removed,poor people have more kids because most dont survive till adulthood more hospitalisation vaccination will lead to fewer deaths and thus less birth
india,not_removed,should have announced direct for nasbandi
india,not_removed,demitronization
india,not_removed,no different speech writer today
india,not_removed,there isnt going to be any major announcement i think just chestthumping on how this fiasco has actually been succesful and thanking people for their overwhelming support
india,not_removed,rs on no
india,not_removed,do you understand what goes into a budget
india,not_removed,ha bhai sirf scheme wala budget
india,not_removed,doesnt he do hindi first and then english
india,not_removed,bijness
india,not_removed,collateral damage of modinomics
india,not_removed,why will he that will break the narrative
india,not_removed,mitroon death kya he mann ka vahem h mitron
india,not_removed,lac loan p housing bubble
india,not_removed,wonder how much of benefit of interest subsidy on the housing loans will be passed on to the customers or maybe a ploy to subsidize banks so that they can write off more loans for rich
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,that announcement would be made in the budget if it is made i dont think he will say anything about that
india,not_removed,mainstream
india,not_removed,mainstream
india,not_removed,main source
india,not_removed,tier tier cities me aa jata hai and if you have land you can build a house in that amount
india,not_removed,its obviously not meant for people living in urban areas in rural areas you can get a decent home for lacs so if you are a farmer id reckon it will help you
india,not_removed,well obviously hes not targetting your south bombay home votebank there are a billion people in india living in small towns where home prices are still under to lakhs you know the middle class by median distribution of wealth in india and not the minimum salary middle class of randia
india,not_removed,some people only take partial loans and not the whole amount as well it helps there
india,not_removed,colaba me try karna
india,not_removed,its also more for reconstruction
india,not_removed,i work in a government hospital and people actually come to us for deliveries because they know theyll get some rs for it even ashas are adamant on bringing every pregnant woman to us regardless of whether shes in labour or not just because they get some money out of it it is true that some cases what you said would occur but there is a bright side to this as well
india,not_removed,its the ground reality
india,not_removed,how the housing will collapse with merge less intrest on just fucking lacks
india,not_removed,well know that in the budget
india,not_removed,that would be the job of finance minister no
india,not_removed,fixed thank you
india,not_removed,yes i think he said districts ie entire india but i think theyll start this from rural areas in the beginning and then proceed to urban areas
india,not_removed,im thinking of self impregnation
india,not_removed,real life doesnt happen anymore bro were living in simulation
india,not_removed,is this just fantasy
india,not_removed,prove it
india,not_removed,ultimate masterstroke to fight traitors illegal immigrants isi agents this is the next surgical strike after demonetisation and army surgical strike on border from henceforth every person living in india is denationalized to prove your nationality every indian must send a video of themselves singing the national anthem and upload it on the narendra modi smartphone app you have days obviously all traitors will not sing the national anthem properly so a spt special patriotic team will investigate each video and catch all traitors and illegal citizens living in india after days plz forward share my plan so it reaches our supreme leader modiji and we can make india great again eagerly waiting for the next surgical strike jai hind 🇮🇳 courtesy or unkill network

india,not_removed,nope not the shit a typical normal middleclass household with a cumulative income between to with members minors living in a major city i believe that comprises a large chunk of working society who gotaregettingwillalwaysbe fucked over edit i apologize if the reply sounds ranty im really disappointed very angry and unfortunately sober days
india,not_removed,dusk was a few hours back in delhi
india,not_removed,id rather some people all over the country understand than most people in a few areas of the country understand
india,not_removed,bumped to yep
india,not_removed,i dont think anyones getting pregnant for a rs bounty
india,not_removed,seriously
india,not_removed,wellif you are pregnant and make rs daily wage your husband blows his money on alcohol then you cannot give basic nutrition to your kid the result is you put your kid and yourself at a higher risk for death during pregnancy this in turn affects the big infant mortality rate now if you are such a womanrs is kind of a big deal i still have a question though as to how that aid would reach you because you may not have a bank account neverthelessits still better than letting infant mortality rate shoot up imagine how crappy youd feel if your newborn kid just died in your arms the sole reason why people in rural areas have more kids is not because of opulance its just because they are not sure if their kids would survive to become adults more adults in the family translates to more income
india,not_removed,and holier than thou something something
india,not_removed,while sitting at the helm of the party that has exponentially growing political funds from anonymous sources
india,not_removed,hahahaha didnt notice wiki copypasta
india,not_removed,pai pai par translation for every penny
india,not_removed,उर्वरक
india,not_removed,lel
india,not_removed,yass
india,not_removed,tbh even that at a usable speed would be huge
india,not_removed,do you think that is a good idea for a country as large and diverse like ours and our democracy
india,not_removed,wait for budget unko chutiyaraj jaitley gift dega
india,not_removed,no but if they could do stuff like provide good roads law enforcement reliable electricity and water services and stuff i bet most taxpayers wouldnt mind money being spent on subsidies for the poor
india,not_removed,did i say that maybe read it again do it for poor then do something for taxpayers too
india,not_removed,then basically fuck the taxpayers take all the taxes from you make cheap homes for the poor what did you get more taxes more swacch bharat taxes which arent even used more taxes on electronics more taxes on everything which middle class buys
india,not_removed,not sure why parent is downvoted but there do exists valid criticism of welfare benefits being transferred as money india being very male dominated specially so in the lower economic strata the chance of this direct transfer being not reaching the children and mother remains high as generally male caretaker of the family will spend the money in gambling or drinking in a way this is a very easy way out for the state to get out of its responsibility of guaranteeing basic services to the people it represents
india,not_removed,thats probably whatll happen
india,not_removed,that is what is going to happen
india,not_removed,some people with good economic background who had successfully predicted some market crashes have already put their statement as a breach to fundamental right and a horryfing move
india,not_removed,yeah needy
india,not_removed,holier than thou
india,not_removed,where do i take this pain of mine i run but it stays right by my side
india,not_removed,holier than thou
india,not_removed,x
india,not_removed,now you can be sure of getting fucked would be more appropriate i feel
india,not_removed,tracer bullet crops
india,not_removed,rabi crops or rabi harvest are agricultural crops sown in winter and harvested in the spring in the south asia
india,not_removed,℅ ℅ for senior citizens for a month fd
india,not_removed,is he repeating the whole speech in english now
india,not_removed,he has learnt better english in two and a half years than the so called educated south indians have learnt hindi in their lifetime
india,not_removed,neat this will live telecast the speech
india,not_removed,damn didnt think of this angle but is a possibility
india,not_removed,minute nahi to free
india,not_removed,now all thats left is for him to make dosas in the air and tell us what apashyam pam kirikiri is
india,not_removed,he cant conjure bs oh yeah so when he comes on national tv justifying demonetisation and thanking people for supporting him is it so wrong to expect him to be accountable if youre so clean and so eager to curb black money is it that hard to take a tough stand on black money and totally do a surgical strike on black money in the political parties by declaring all political funds in political parties to be declared publicly will that be conjuring bs as well so you just want to preach what you yourself dont want to practice
india,not_removed,he knew it turned into a fcuking meme
india,not_removed,i dont know this is the first time im listening to something like this
india,not_removed,lakhs number of people taking out loan
india,not_removed,one can build a mahal in that amount
india,not_removed,one square foot aa jayega
india,not_removed,yes more institutionalized deliveriesless infant deaths this is why government is motivating mothers with incentives
india,not_removed,bc it was a joke
india,not_removed,bhai foreign tours bhi ea minister ka hi job tha na fir bhi modikaka ja rahena bar bar foreign tours
india,not_removed,unfortunately there are millions of poor who think more kids equals more earning hands the rs is going to be an encouragement for them to continue with their earlier rationalisation
india,not_removed,youd be surprised this is after all a country of jugaad
india,not_removed,well thats modi for you ive heard bhakts had cum while he was speaking
india,not_removed,nope and frankly not possible basically if a state government falls mid term do you put state under president rule for years or if central government falls do you cut down tenure of democratically elected state governments
india,not_removed,whaaaaaaaaaat isnt like of all india under the poverty line and on top of that of people pay full tax every year even in n america government takes income tax and distributes it to poor to make them less poor i always thought thats how taxes collectively work they take of my income i dont wonder if they will use it for me that sounds selfish
india,not_removed,yeah i wouldnt take economists too seriously i am not saying we should totally ignore economists their analysis of an event after it has happened is invaluable but their predictions are usually all over the place there are many variables that they have no way to tracktheorize about like the increase in trust of the system which will show up in increased taxes or improvements in access to banking which will increase systemic efficiency and can be monitored by looking at increase in banking or the prices of goods and real estate
india,not_removed,yes even the hindi speakers could have avoided a headache httpwebcastgovinlive
india,not_removed,alteast south indians can speak a word or two in hindi north indians dont even know which language theysouth indians are speaking soras i am one of em
india,not_removed,guess that shows reaching out to those people is important than them learning hindi
india,not_removed,must be all that weed energy
india,not_removed,english is easy to learn than hindi period
india,not_removed,yeah
india,not_removed,bimaru states be getting reech
india,not_removed,read my comment again is it so wrong to expect him to be accountable i never told you to not hold pm accountable he is very much accountable i just said that dont expect facts about aftermaths after such humongous exercise ends declaring all political funds in political parties to be declared publicly will that be conjuring bs as well although you didnt mention this demand in your original comment and its a little whataboutism but still i support this donations to political parties should become public although one should understand the original reasoning behind this was the same as the one behind secret ballot the same reason why film stars in india generally dont affiliate with political parties
india,not_removed,housing bubble occurs when there is a high demand for houses so price artificially increase modi is only gonna give lakh subsidized loan per person a person with lakh subsidized loan isnt going to impact urban real estate market too much as average costs for a flat in major cities are far more than lakh so there wont be any artificial surge in housing demand even if he millions of people get lac loan
india,not_removed,tier mein im literally sitting in a fancy fort resort and across from it is a new set of apartments with an advertised price of lakh this is on the outskirts of alwar probably a tier city
india,not_removed,ghar kya hai mitron man ka vehem
india,not_removed,youre right i just wrote the first think that came to my mind
india,not_removed,my comment wasnt the bc is quite unprovoked do you need a samosa
india,not_removed,upvote for modikaka
india,not_removed,not really diplomacy cant all be done by ministers foreign pm or presidents cant be expected to meet our foreign minister can they
india,not_removed,exactly i was thinking that also i think it would be really a huge disadvantage to the regional parties it would reduce diversity in our politics and political party
india,not_removed,they have done something like this in the uk it makes it harder for parliament to be dissolved ahead of term needs majority for dissolution so a govt in power cannot dissolve parliament at will and call for snap polls anymore
india,not_removed,you simply put in a rule that the new government will not last full term and would have to fight elections again when they are simultaneously held all over the country this will also give incentive to politicians to not destabilize governments midterm
india,not_removed,yeah lets just keep paying more and more taxes without wondering why isnt anything happening using them just like swacch bharat that doesnt seem okay to me i am selfish i guess and then we are at it lets keep loss making psus alive too just like so they can give out more unsecured loans to more loss making ventures
india,not_removed,north indians dont even know which language they are speaking huh alteast south indians can speak a word or two in hindi i can speak english hindi french and sanskrit know some words of spanish and italian to kya nachu translation should i dance note this doesnt mean i support uimronniepickering s views i am whole heartedly against the second part of his comment no hate to south indian brothers its your right and choice to not learn hindi
india,not_removed,thats your view its a subjective thing not an objective thing edit grammar
india,not_removed,i just said that dont expect facts about aftermaths after such humongous exercise ends rbi was giving out facts about cash coming into banks every week until they abruptly stopped at the last daysfor whatever reason so as of the last update we had t come back out of the t so taking the calculations as even a layperson it is clear that no black money has come in any economist worth his salt can give you that info but modi doesnt believe in economists though another fact he could have given is a time frame when situation will become normal there have been umpteen discussions here about how long itll take for cash to return to normalcy so again i wonder why modi couldnt get that data from his best of the best navratnas again relying on this demonetisation when it has nowhere worked in the whole world ever before and expecting it to somehow work with this government and expecting a magic by some feel good talks about going after corruption and bm when you yourself and your party is not ready to even take the first fucking baby step of declaring funds reeks of political opportunism and expecting the people to be sheep to bleat to your tunes somehow modi is dreaming about being the pied piper to cleanse india by eliminating parallel economy and black economy when you dont lead by example is just hollow rhetoric
india,not_removed,that makes sense
india,not_removed,good for you can speak so many languages most people cant go beyond usually english is common followed by their regional language and some other language they studied in school i only know englishhindimarathi about north indians dont even know which language they are speaking i mean i can differentiate between gujratimarwaribhojpuri etc language if i hear them but its hard for me to differentiate between malyalikannadatamil etc what i mean to say is its hard for north indian to say which language his fella from south india is speaking
india,not_removed,english gets people jobs and opportunities there is very little need to learn hindi we should be looking at technological solutions to make it easy for officials to disseminate information in many languages its good to learn a new language but we are already wasting so much of effort because of learning science in nonnative language
india,not_removed,the politics of mismanaging drought the budget for watershed development programme was increased significantly after the committee chaired by prof hanumantha rao gave its report in to ensure availability of cheap labour forced migration of poor people is being orchestrated through a very active policy of indifference and apathy in modern democratic india employment programmes should create watershed structures but also expand markets for local knowledge resources institutions skills etc unless we drastically reduce or eliminate cultivation of sugarcane in drought prone areas we will not have made any durable dent on the problem i hope that good sense will prevail strong decisive and empathetic leadership will emerge in different parts of the country to conserve augment and distribute water fairly to its most efficient uses here are some other news itemscredits to httpwwwlatimescomworldlafgirandroughtsnapstoryhtml im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme

india,not_removed,the case is pretty old from damn it the guys perseverance mr shyam narayan chouksey a retired engineer in bhopal went to see kabhi khushi kabhi gham early in like a good indian schoolboy he promptly stood up as a mark of respect when a sequence in the film used bits of the national anthem but mr chouksey was shocked to see that he was the only person standing up so he went around urging others in the audience to follow his example obstructing their view and generally getting on everybodys nerves he was finally shouted down but this strengthened his personal satyagraha he moved from one district to another protesting in front of cinema halls he eventually met the district police superintendent and found a soulmate in him the police issued orders that people would have to stand up during the anthem sequence or action would be taken to madhya pradeshs credit this went unheeded so mr chouksey filed a public interest litigation at the jabalpur high court he had been doubly offended first the national anthem had been desecrated by commercial use in a film second people should be made to stand up even when the anthem was played or sung in a film or documentary or whatever by then the fever had caught on the high court banned in a judgment the screening of the film until the offensive sequence was deleted then the supreme court swung into action and suspended the high courts ban in september it pointed out that the union government did not expect indians to stand up while the anthem was being sung in a film and day before yesterday the supreme court ruled that indians do not have to stand up when the national anthem came on as part of a film mp hc bans screening of kabhi khushi kabhi gham in terming as objectionable the singing of the national anthem in hindi film kabhi khusi kabhi gham madhya pradesh high court today banned its screening till the scene is removed from the movie on a writ petition filed by s n chouksey a retired engineer the court directed the producer and director of the film yash and karan johar to remove the objectionable scene and also asked them to pay rs to the petitioner the multistarer film would not be screened in any cinema house until and unless the objectionable scene is removed the division bench ordered supreme court to examine use of national anthem in films in the supreme court said on friday it would examine the question whether the national anthem could be commercially exploited in films a threejudge bench comprising chief justice rc lahoti justice sb sinha and justice sh kapadia said it would also examine whether actors in the films should stand up when the national anthem was being sung the bench said we will hear the petition on all points except the certificate issued for screening of the film by the central board for film certification mr chouksey had sought a review of the apex court judgment on the ground that the court had not adjudicated on the issue of commercial exploitation of the national anthem raised in his petition before the high court insult to national anthem in karan johar gets clean chit after years in jan filed by another petitioner the director of khabhi khushi kabhi gam karan johar got a major relief after years of legal battle on tuesday when a local court gave him clean chit in a case filed against him on charges of insulting the national anthem in the movie a local resident pradeep chandra had moved to the court of judicial magistrate in under the prevention of insult to the national honour act alleging that the national anthem was not played in the desired manner in the movie supreme court issues notice to the central government in petition against commercial exploitation of national anthem in oct the supreme court of india has issued notice to the central government in a petition seeking amongst other things a bar on the commercial exploitation of national anthem for financial or any other gains chouksey has made the following suggestions to avoid the abuse of national anthem there should be no commercial exploitation to gain financial advantage or any kind of benefit there should be no interruption in between till the completion of national anthem and no abridged version of national anthem shall be sung at any point of time there should not be dramatization of the national anthem and it should not be sung in an entertainment programme it should not be sung before the people who do not understand it unless they are properly apprised that when the national anthem of india is to be played they are required to show respect it should not be printed on undesirable objects and should not be displayed in such a manner and at such places which may be disgraceful to its status and may tantamount to disrespect apart from the aforesaid suggestions it has also been prayed that directions should be issued that the national anthem should be played in the cinema theatres across the country before the feature film chouksey has also sought for proper norms and protocol to be fixed with regard to playing or singing of national anthem in an official function and functions where certain constitutional dignitaries are present httpbarandbenchcomsupremecourtissuesnoticepetitioncommercialexploitationnationalanthem there might be more events in the timeline might have been missed out good read

india,not_removed,this is such nonsense paying your taxes giving back to your community not breaking laws keeping your citycountry clean these are marks of true patriotism forcing people to respect the national anthem is a cheap useless and empty gesture that doesnt do anything to actually help the country when it comes to this garbage the supreme court wont hesitate to overreach but when it comes to womens rights lgbt rights or other social issues of greater importance they cower behind their desks saying our hands our tied seriously fuck this shit
india,not_removed,i fear the overuse of national symbols in irrelevant situations will reduce the emotional appeal of important things
india,not_removed,i dont know what the fuss is all about i believe we should not only stand up during the national anthem being played in movie halls but also sing along with one arm raised in a clenched fist it will foster patriotism after the natioal anthem is over we must pledge our allegiance to the supreme leader all the while keeping the arm raised it will be easier to identify the traitors among our midst this way l
india,not_removed,what about before taking a shit cant you hold it in for mins for the fucking country

india,not_removed,i have said this many times our higher judiciary is retarded they will conveniently shift the onus of scrapping back to the legislature but interfere no end in bcci affairs they will pass moral sermons on inconvenience caused to the public due to demonetization but pay no heed to the same public which has been standing outside its doors for decades waiting for justice these are the same judges who will allow kapil sibal to argue over telephone but not give a single hearing in a year to the nirbhaya case their judgments are full of regressive assertions husband is god to a woman a married woman has less to lose than a virgin in case of rape etc and are often bizzare i am glad i dont have to appear before them any more fucking lunatics

india,not_removed,huh really feels like ultra nationalism is taking over the world again sad to see its even hitting india
india,not_removed,chutiye hai behnchod
india,not_removed,hmmm no this is not enough it should be made mandatory to have the national anthem played times a day from loudspeakers across the city citizens should stop what they are doing and salute in the direction of parliament while kneeling oh yea we can have special saluting mats on which citizens can kneel on this would be a good start
india,not_removed,from the article above i now believe that even if i could stand up during the national anthem i would rather not simply because i am being forced to do so my father is an air force veteran i represented the nation in wheelchair tennis at the australian open look at my life choices who are you to judge how much i love india is this why we fought the colonialists did we get our freedom only to become sheep and that too led by the most sinister manipulative brutes among us i will not participate in this sham if the judge is swayed by hyperbole and emotion and sentiment to look away from facts then whats the point of abolishing the jury from the indian judiciary bring it back your patriotism is not defined by whether you play the national anthem before the movie or stand up while its being played its defined when you do the small things which others might ridicule you for its when you put that nowempty frooti tetra pack in your bag so you can dispose it off in a dustbin its when you stand up against your bully when your friends say dont its when you stop your bike before the zebra crossing its also there when you stand up when the national anthem is played during the january republic day broadcast when your entire familysibling laugh at you because you want to its present when you strike up a talk with a group of jawans on a train and its there when you do free tuitions to teach your mother tongue to a keralite kid who is failing in your mother tongue subject in his class i have done all of the above things and it filled me with joy and pride immeasurable for the entire time it brings a smile to my face anytime that i think about it being forced to stand in a movie hall for the movie hall would make standing up for the anthem just another chore this ruling by sc is just plain wrong but fuck movie halls anyway you guys never say the kind of sound system that you have and the wailing babies and idiots spoiling the story or talking or ringing cellphones or tweeting with a bright screen in the dark hall and the overpriced popcorn food and the people being so judgy with how i have dressed up and the shitty cringemax adsthe list goes on nope edit this is how you do road safety ads not the cringey shit maximum effort

india,not_removed,this reminds me of the glorious loyalty oath crusade in from that timeless classic almost overnight the glorious loyalty oath crusade was in full flower and captain black was enraptured to discover himself spearheading it he had really hit on something all the enlisted men and officers on combat duty had to sign a loyalty oath to get their map cases from the intelligence tent a second loyalty oath to receive their flak suits and parachutes from the parachute tent a third loyalty oath for lieutenant balkington the motor vehicle officer to be allowed to ride from the squadron to the airfield in one of the trucks every time they turned around there was another loyalty oath to be signed they signed a loyalty oath to get their pay from the finance officer to obtain their px supplies to have their hair cut by the italian barbers to captain black every officer who supported his glorious loyalty oath crusade was a competitor and he planned and plotted twentyfour hours a day to keep one step ahead he would stand second to none in his devotion to country when other officers had followed his urging and introduced loyalty oaths of their own he went them one better by making every son of a bitch who came to his intelligence tent sign two loyalty oaths then three then four then he introduced the pledge of allegiance and after that the starspangled banner one chorus two choruses three choruses four choruses each time captain black forged ahead of his competitors he swung upon them scornfully for their failure to follow his example each time they followed his example he retreated with concern and racked his brain for some new stratagem that would enable him to turn upon them scornfully again without realizing how it had come about the combat men in the squadron discovered themselves dominated by the administrators appointed to serve them they were bullied insulted harassed and shoved about all day long by one after the other when they voiced objection captain black replied that people who were loyal would not mind signing all the loyalty oaths they had to to anyone who questioned the effectiveness of the loyalty oaths he replied that people who really did owe allegiance to their country would be proud to pledge it as often as he forced them to and to anyone who questioned the morality he replied that the starspangled banner was the greatest piece of music ever composed the more loyalty oaths a person signed the more loyal he was to captain black it was as simple as that and he had corporal kolodny sign hundreds with his name each day so that he could always prove he was more loyal than anyone else the important thing is to keep them pledging he explained to his cohorts it doesnt matter whether they mean it or not thats why they make little kids pledge allegiance even before they know what pledge and allegiance means finally this incredible lunacy is brought to an abrupt end by a laconic character whom everybody is afraid of when he calmly saunters into the mess room and demands that everyone be given food period
india,not_removed,this is exactly what happens when jingoism is rooted so deep in a society
india,not_removed,national anthem must be played in theatres before movies orders supreme court the supreme court on wednesday made it mandatory for cinema halls to play national anthem before screening of a film apex court ordered that national anthem should be played in all cinema halls across the country before movie starts accompanied by national flag on screen delivering the order the apex court said citizen must respect the national anthem flag all people present must rise and pay respect to the anthem the top court said sc also ordered that nobody can print the anthem on any undesirable object supreme court directed that there should be no commercial exploitation of national anthem for any financial gains the national anthem is already played before movies in some states such as maharashtra version function i post the articles text as a comment if the website is adblocker unfriendly rendered by prometheus

india,not_removed,are these justices eyeing retirement benefits
india,not_removed,just another reason on top of tons others why i never go to theaters in india
india,not_removed,a very accurate quote i read on some news site by someone named qts by singing national anthem or standing during national anthem is being played whether it is being played in cinema hall entertainment arena stadium drink bar and discothèque entertainment clubs school college bus and railway station or aerodrome does not make oneself a patriotic nationalist or socialist why my answer when a man or a women who calls himself or herself a lawmakers barrister or lawyer and judges of court of law who had sworn under the oath is busy debating whether or where national anthem should be played rather solving lacs cases filed in supreme court of india is pending verdict itself shows they are not patriotic rather pathetic entertainers and vermin eating hard earned taxpayers money
india,not_removed,what surprises me most is that this came not as a law by nationalismpandering parliament but by the erudite justices of the sc when the educated people start talking jingoism the country is in trouble
india,not_removed,its about time we started having our two minutes hate

india,not_removed,i am sure this is just a joke or another dangling carrot to distract people from this massive dump the goberment took on daily well being of a common man

india,not_removed,lets see the supreme court sing the national anthem every day before starting a session
india,not_removed,the irony is that this kind of an order in the us would be viewed as going against the tenets of the first amendment while here in india the custodians of the constitution have no problem coming up with ways which kills freedom of speech while displaying their awesome power to push propaganda down an indians throat
india,not_removed,youre welcome

india,not_removed,i love how my nontax paying friends even though they earn more money than i do say that this is a right move if they are so concerned about the country i wonder why they try to pay almost negligible amount to the government and i also wonder where there sense of patriotism goes when they blatantly spit on the road throw discarded wastes on the road as if everything is a dust bin showy nationalist on the outside while being self centered jerk on the inside this is how the people in the country are and judgements like this will only make it worse
india,not_removed,its gonna be awkward standing the a national anthem for screening of an adult film
india,not_removed,the cji was recently crying because the courts are under staffed yet apparently they do have time and resources to spend on the weighty subject of playing the national anthem in theatres glad theyve got their priorities straight
india,not_removed,the us playing it before every sporting event is absurd india playing it before every movie is even more ridiculous it is possible for national songs to lose their meaning when played in such frivolous locations
india,not_removed,im relieved of the fact about what people think here if i go about talking how stupid this idea is out of reddit im probably getting my ass kicked this may not be stupid but this seems to be a propaganda for what it looks instead of fining people who litter the streets they are doing this
india,not_removed,thank you sc fuck this rule i will torrent the movies like always you gave me another reason to not go to a movie hall
india,not_removed,i will never get up if they play our anthem in theatres i payed to spend time at the venue for entertainment and to get away from nonsense thats happening in this country instead ill be munching my flavored popcorn and maybe hum the tune if ar rahman tune it but that doesnt mean that i disrespect my nation even if sc push it down my throat i have to decide whether to stand or not until they poke my ass with one of those bayonet
india,not_removed,give this guy a psycho profile already he should be only allowed to take decisions based on his mental fitness and not get off my lawn kinda tactics lets make psychological evals mandatory for guys in high profile positions like this mofo so he is not taking indians for a ride by making remarks like this wallowing individually perceived notion of freedom must go i like how air force pilots over the world have to take psycho evals all the time in their life especially when sitting in a multi million dollar nuclear capable cockpit
india,not_removed,an illiberal nation with illogical rules things will only become worse from now not better
india,not_removed,its the year its compulsory to sing the national anthem yell bharat mata ki jai and fight on the border before taking a dump
india,not_removed,is there an extension for kodi that streams national anthem before playing every movie
india,not_removed,i will support and adhere to this if im allowed to wear a mankini with the indian flag on it ffs bakchodi h patriotism seems to be the only virtue that a corrupt and a chutiya ideal that this country has reminds me of this post implementing this law in a way defeats what the sanctity of the anthem stands for
india,not_removed,whats the significance of theatres that the national anthem needs to be played there
india,not_removed,i have said several times that the indian judges are a bunch of chutiyas most of them even katju is a big chut who has given tons of nonsense rulings they rule on sentiment rather than the law checks and balances are no use because we have chutiyas everywhere
india,not_removed,now the crowd will make sure that you stand for a bit first or youll never stand again
india,not_removed,and everyone must stand and all men must make sure their dicks are also at attention to enable erections for everyone theyll play a porn clip just before the national anthem

india,not_removed,now people will enter hall only after national anthem is played i have seen this in mumbai already
india,not_removed,wtf is this shit
india,not_removed,does this include xrated movies khada ho uske pehle khade ho
india,not_removed,nationalism on the rise around the world i see
india,not_removed,now lets focus on banning sub titles from english movies
india,not_removed,this forced nationalism is almost bordering to stupidity anyway thats exactly what we are trying to prove all these while
india,not_removed,doors must remain locked so that no one can create any kind of disturbance surely this wont end with a bunch of people cooked alive in a locked theater or a whole host of creative new terrorist attacks they really thought this one through
india,not_removed,looks like sc have lot of time in its hand to consider such cases
india,not_removed,at least we are not from uruguay where the anthem runs for more than minsours is only seconds
india,not_removed,well i am now not going to enter the cinema till they finish playing the anthem
india,not_removed,what the fuck
india,not_removed,good now start playing before every soap opera
india,not_removed,is it legally required to stand up
india,not_removed,national anthem is going to lose its respect slowly and gradually it is not far away when movie goers will decide they are bored of standing to it every time lets skip it this time
india,not_removed,when does this start in which date will it apply from second is the anthem screened before or after rahulraju dies from cancer due to smoking
india,not_removed,so non indian citizens firangs can just stand
india,not_removed,what happened to people who were okay with limitation on personal liberties in case of firecracker ban now same kind of people wan to hide behind their right to freedom and liberty i still think though court probably should let parliament do its job and parliament should actually do its job we should evolve as a democracy so governmentlegislature doesnt need to hind behind courts
india,not_removed,its only a matter if time this ruling will fade away
india,not_removed,well now that we have no choice or say in this we might as well go the american way and have dhruv ghanekar or baiju do the national anthems before sporting events and all that
india,not_removed,at this rate well all be implanted with a chip in our brain that plays the national anthem
india,not_removed,would this be played before bgrade movies too
india,not_removed,video on demand is the way to go i have started enjoying paid content more than pirated and the overall fuckery of going to the theater this now another item in the list and i will list this चुतियापा even higher than the popcorn prices
india,not_removed,im not going to stand and if someone objects ill ask them to recite the preamble or ask other questions about the constitution
india,not_removed,chutiyapa
india,not_removed,saar does this apply for b grade movies
india,not_removed,ridiculous just dont go in until anthems ans whatever horse manure they want to show before the movie go in and find your prebooked seat once the actual movie is starting
india,not_removed,excellent news since we will officially going to cinemas to pay respect to the national anthem and flag it is no longer entertainment and they should remove any entertainment tax and make movies tax free yea
india,not_removed,kaisa chutiya desh hai ye
india,not_removed,so does this mean it will stop in the theatres in maharashtra because maharashtrians do not give a two shit flying fuck about supreme court orders and say मी कायदा तोडणार and shit like that
india,not_removed,sc is my god after crackers i am glad that they cleared this matter up
india,not_removed,jesus fuck why are we trying so hard to be like the americans so not only have they infiltrated the culture of our films but also our filmwatching experience offs
india,not_removed,very good new genration dont respect the country and this will teach some as they all the time useless with they life only go to movie and play video game so many time in the day they will hear this and mb train they brain
india,not_removed,okay i seriously dont understand what rindias problem is here you dont want to stand for seconds to pay respect to the nation before sitting down and stuffing your face with popcorn
india,not_removed,ad block and you are jailed with life sentences
india,not_removed,you the mvp on this thread
india,not_removed,now today the supreme court today made it mandatory for all cinema theatres to play the national anthem before a movie begins during which the national flag is to be shown on the screen a bench of justice dipak misra and justice amitava roy also said that everyone present in cinema hall should rise up and pay respect to the anthem when it is played when the national anthem is played it is imperative for everyone to show honour and respect it would instill a sense of committed patriotism and nationalism it said time has come for people to realise that the national anthem is a symbol of constitutional patriotismpeople must feel they live in a nation and this wallowing individually perceived notion of freedom must gopeople must feel this is my country my motherland justice misra said it was mandatory for cinema halls to play the national anthem after every movie in the the practice faded away over the years as multiplexes dramatically changed the moviewatching experience in maharashtra had ordered that the anthem has to be played before the screening of any film the national anthem must not be printed on any undesirable object and should not be used for any commercial purposes also no dramatisation of the anthem should be allowed the court said also asking asked the government to specify what would constitute disrespect to it and its abuse the court also ruled that the national anthem cannot be commercially exploited to gain financial advantage or benefit it cannot be introduced or used as part of any entertainment program or variety show said the bench the centre for its part agreed to circulate the order to all states chief secretaries and also to publish it in electronic and print media httpwwwlivelawinnationalanthemmustmoviestheatressc
india,not_removed,this is so fucking stupid this guy is in the same league as kamlesh vaswani ive slowly started to lose trust in the courts of india first the ridiculous pokemon go ban then this shit
india,not_removed,i would give you gold but who am i kidding this is rindia where noone gives gold unless its deductable us of the income tax act

india,not_removed,exactlythese motherfuckers are no judgetheir fucking selfcentered mind should not control the justiceby the peopleof the bjpfor the lobbyist
india,not_removed,no no no we also need anthems from atms everytime we withdraw more than s
india,not_removed,i think it will lead to exactly the opposite of what youre worried about that worries me i am going to call it patriotic inflation
india,not_removed,exactly if we will repeat it several time it will degrade its value specially after when some shitty bollywood movie is played next
india,not_removed,i use to feel proud back in school singing the national anthem now that they have started forcing it down my throat i cannot really care anymore
india,not_removed,heil mudi
india,not_removed,thats a weird username
india,not_removed,my mouse was hovering over the downvote arrow but now id gild you if i wasnt gareeb
india,not_removed,waves a kulcha proudly
india,not_removed,soldiers are dying on border and you need to take a dump fucking pakistani pig
india,not_removed,the anthem lasts seconds you heretic tweet to mea for expedited work on your pakistan visa
india,not_removed,isi agent spotted our national anthem is only i guess you were planning to sing the pak anthem on top of it
india,not_removed,shittiest joke of the day i actually remember a santabanta joke from around two decades ago which kept circulating by word of mouth two guys santa and banta traveling on a road have a strong urge to poop they find only one toilet near a roadside establishment santa hops in first dashing in before banta could banta in a desperate urge to control the pressure starts parading around in goosestep singing national anthem eventually after singing it almost a dozen times there is no hint of santa coming out banta angrily knocks on the door barely able to control his load shouting where the fuck are you come the fuck out santa simply says i havent even started you were singing national anthem so i kept standing up in the right position all the time to respect our nation now keep waiting
india,not_removed,then prepare to have yourself verbally andor physically abused edit if we dont stand itll be in contempt of the sc
india,not_removed,i am going to torrent
india,not_removed,it has become too expensive anyway buy a good set of earphones or even those razer earphones and enjoy it in the privacy of your home
india,not_removed,exactly y mix patriotism with entertainment august ko to sala sab sote rehta haikisiko kuch matlab ho nahiaur ab theatre mein wah chu govt
india,not_removed,some cases you might be asked to go to pakistan but ymmv
india,not_removed,im guessing number of videos of people beating other people inside a theatre are gunna increase now
india,not_removed,but but then how will you show your patriotism the obvious solution is to snatch everyones freedom and force them to stand for mins against their will to show the world that india is a free country
india,not_removed,lol india went full ameritard with this ruling
india,not_removed,so supreme court corrupt and fascist mofos
india,not_removed,i blame the congress for this they were ones who started this stupidity in mh seriously
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,something something fascism
india,not_removed,bhai these days we should just assume the joke is on us unless proven otherwise
india,not_removed,very true everything is arbitrary in our country
india,not_removed,i throw up a little bit in my mouth everytime someone says they have full faith in the judiciary
india,not_removed,hey its all over again
india,not_removed,dont give them ideas
india,not_removed,before playing a youtube video
india,not_removed,before every sitting of ls and rs and a supreme court sitting
india,not_removed,my question is can courts do it like isnt this business of legislature can court enforce law which isnt in constitution act or a statute
india,not_removed,yes why not ensure everyone is in attention sings to perfect tune pronounces all the bengali words perfectly thatll be a start
india,not_removed,you will soon have it before the next elections gone are the days of mandir yahin banayenge its now anthem yahinkahin bhi gaayenge tumhe bhi sunwayenge
india,not_removed,the decision is fucked up at so many levels sc is overstepping its bounds and clearly making an executive decision not only is sc making an executive decision it is making the sort of idiotic nonsensical decision you would have expected it to protect us from in case an overzealous executive forced it upon us sc wasting its time with cases like these is there an airport in shimla yet justice ts thakur
india,not_removed,i think its adorable i had no idea india had a national anthem is it a beatles song
india,not_removed,and it should also be played on loop in all the toilets in the supreme court premises to pee or not to pee will be the biggest decision the honorable judges will have to make
india,not_removed,stop looking for reasons just do it seeding
india,not_removed,and toilets too
india,not_removed,or go in late
india,not_removed,the national anthem must be played in all cinemas before movie screenings and all exits will be shut during that time the supreme court ruled on tuesday apparently they wont let you leave source
india,not_removed,bro you will be lynched
india,not_removed,you forgot s
india,not_removed,im more interested in seeing patriot overreactions when someone doesnt stand up in the cinema
india,not_removed,thats worth sec youtube skipping for over a year
india,not_removed,shove everything up down our throats and up our asses get your shoving directions correct youre a citizen of india you must get used to it for atleast the next yrs
india,not_removed,to a good extent it already is we are a democracy but not a free one and what freedoms we have are being stripped away by the government and our supposed saviour supreme fucking court
india,not_removed,lets read
india,not_removed,in india its done in all schools
india,not_removed,same thing in usa either the anthem pledge of allegiance or both in almost all schools every morning my high school only did it once a week though
india,not_removed,this is not gonna be done away with even the government supports this also most people in india are ultra nationalist and easily manipulated
india,not_removed,national anthem on continuous loop on public transport including railways and air india that might be too mu never mind
india,not_removed,implying you would stay in india if you had that option
india,not_removed,this is not about logic this is about emotion and sentiment do you have those in you to become the judge s
india,not_removed,this is ijs is needed a common person can never rise upto that position
india,not_removed,its even more disconcerting to see young people on fb blindly accept these views without applying an iota of critical thinking i guess it doesnt take a lot to brainwash people these days they are all turning into useful idiots
india,not_removed,and it will be played at theaters across the world
india,not_removed,well wearing the flag below your waist is prohibited so this wont happen
india,not_removed,whataboutism is never a right way to go in any direction but this is a retarded order thankfully it is just an interim order rather than planting a seed of nationalism in the citizens hearts sc is stuffing it down the head
india,not_removed,do you suspect that a rss hand is involved when you wake up with a stain on your bedsheet too
india,not_removed,where did rss come into this
india,not_removed,i dont like this rule but afaik the general public were not allowed to hoist indian flag before so rss were simply waiting for it to be legal
india,not_removed,remember what happened when the last time the entire world became hyper nationalistic
india,not_removed,lets also have the national flag tattooed on our dicks
india,not_removed,at least randia should play national anthem when you open the page
india,not_removed,so theres at least one part of the body thats standing at attention
india,not_removed,modi brought in then asked people to remember the jawans as they stand in queues guess sc just wants its piece of pie in the dick measuring contest and has asked people to remember the national anthem
india,not_removed,the entire world is going the self indulgent way buddy you cant escape wherever you go its better to think of how to fix it here
india,not_removed,this shit is going on everywhere to be frank trump brexit modi globalism is on the decline and nationalism is on the rise
india,not_removed,it isnt super easy to immigrant to canada unless you have family already here a lot of money good credentials etc
india,not_removed,earth is fucked sign up for alpha centauri
india,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikivisapolicyofsvalbard although i think you need to have some amount of income otherwise you get deported
india,not_removed,what purpose does it serve to remind you every time that the rulers of this country are retarded twats
india,not_removed,mass deportation to pakistan for being terrorists s
india,not_removed,why are chutiyas like this not forced to retire then
india,not_removed,seriously i want to know what can we do i mean the supreme court in this country is absolute trash but what can we expect when people like that katju or whatever his name is were qualified enough to be judges im not going to lie given a chance to immigrate a truly liberal nation not us i would do it in a heartbeat
india,not_removed,without realizing how it had come about the combat men in the squadron discovered themselves dominated by the administrators appointed to serve them they were bullied insulted harassed and shoved about all day long by one after the other when they voiced objection captain black replied that people who were loyal would not mind signing all the loyalty oaths they had to to anyone who questioned the effectiveness of the loyalty oaths he replied that people who really did owe allegiance to their country would be proud to pledge it as often as he forced them to and to anyone who questioned the morality he replied that the starspangled banner was the greatest piece of music ever composed reckon it holds good for the demonetisatin drive too
india,not_removed,you do realize that sc and bjp are two different things do you and that the present crop of judges do not particularly like the government dont conveniently blame the executive for brain fart by the judiciary
india,not_removed,and a parade around the compound too
india,not_removed,🔔🔔🔔
india,not_removed,ofcourse all bajrang anthem rakshaks unite
india,not_removed,even samacharbot gave up at the absurdity
india,not_removed,tumse na ho payega
india,not_removed,freedom boner regular boner
india,not_removed,hehe good way to rationalize the idiocy
india,not_removed,bhai puchne ke pehle hi pit jayega har angle se bhakt to brainwala ratio is in theaters some disabled guy on wheelchair got slapped from behind during national anthem for not standing then the guy from behind saw wheel chair later and like ohhh sorry
india,not_removed,just talk about yourself and dont generalise maharashtrians
india,not_removed,oookay
india,not_removed,when liberty is not an issue worth fighting for nothing else is
india,not_removed,how is it a nonissue
india,not_removed,non issue why does this unnecessary display of nationalism before a movie even necessary according to you tomorrow they say that you have to stand up for national anthem before your early morning sandaas i see you having no issue to that as well
india,not_removed,no
india,not_removed,nope
india,not_removed,your honor it was a virus i swear i dont even know what adblocker is
india,not_removed,i thought he was the samachar bot
india,not_removed,this wallowing individually perceived notion of freedom must go
india,not_removed,people must feel this is my country my motherland and making them hear national anthem is the way to go
india,not_removed,retired engineer thats enough explanation for me
india,not_removed,ive slowly started to lose trust in the courts of india wasnt salman case enough
india,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomxvsbpypgifv
india,not_removed,it takes just one retarded unkil with his stupid chestbeating patriotic obsession in bhopal he runs a ngo he has had filed a petition against illegal construction and over non maintenance or neglect of gandhis samadhi
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,lolis that a thing link to amma anthem plz
india,not_removed,its quite a recent thing about an year or so
india,not_removed,thats illegal under
india,not_removed,hell be cji from august to october stock enough lube httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofsittingjudgesofthesupremecourtofindia
india,not_removed,yep exactly i honestly believe sri lanka will be the first country in the region to reach developed status their hdi per capita is the highest in the region socially they seem to be more mature than the rest and their population is pretty small given the high population of other countries in the subcontinent
india,not_removed,can confirm the country is spanking clean for a developing nation
india,not_removed,be careful of what you wish for even sarcastically before long youll be singing the anthem and waving the flag followed by signing pledges before you can insert your card in the atm
india,not_removed,all ringtones and callertunes to be compulsorily set as the national anthem also you cannot pickup a call until the song is over of course it goes without saying you need to stand up as soon as you receive or make a call and dont you dare put your phone on silent you antinational scum
india,not_removed,patriotic inflation top kek
india,not_removed,i think it will lead to exactly the opposite of what youre worried about that worries me during economic inflation the value of currency declines visavis the goods and services so by analogy during patriotic inflation the value of nation symbol should decline in which case uironypatrol has used the made up word correctly unless you meant something different
india,not_removed,we might as well start signing pledges before every movie we seem to be doing that anyways outside of movie theatres
india,not_removed,you have a way with your words my man
india,not_removed,to this date many people are wondering what happened to that guy edit found out august landmesser is the name the guy was member of nazi party but the party didnt like him due to his affair with a woman later his wife he was forced into military service where he was killed in the war and his wife died in concentration camp kulcha was strong in europe in those days and it got him does this not ring the bells of how india would be if hindutva parties reigned supreme
india,not_removed,at least it isnt a wifi password🕶️
india,not_removed,and ashish
india,not_removed,i say install a camera in everyones bathroom if anyone starts shitting before reciting the anthem or even in the middle of it that traitor better be behind bars by the next day saale jo desh ke liye tatti nai rok sakte our nation is better off without those fucks
india,not_removed,modis already taken a massive dump on this country on nov
india,not_removed,you need a breather to bask in its epicness for another min
india,not_removed,tn cinema halls dont have this tradition of playing national anthem until now well anyway as far as tn is concerned here nothing is holycow regarding nationalism national anthem was cutshort during cms swearingin as she couldnt stand longer no body gave a flying fuck about this lol
india,not_removed,the court said that when the anthem is played in movie halls it should be accompanied with images of the national flag on screen and people must stand up it however clarified that the disabled would be exempt
india,not_removed,not a lawyer but i imagine it can be challenged as the final decision would be taken by a constitutional bench like in many other controversial decisions remains to be seen prashant bhushan tweeted about this but did not indicate any plans to challenge it interesting days ahead sadly the theater owners and the chains are not going to challenge it as they would hate to fuel the fire and attract the wrath of certain groups of people
india,not_removed,all torrents are now required to have national anthem and flags at the begining
india,not_removed,exactly never going to the cinema again i dont oppose playing the national anthem i oppose the bhakts who will beat you up if you dont feel like standing its like the beginning of a whole new religion
india,not_removed,hotstar and netflix till they start censoring them
india,not_removed,who isnt but i really wanted to see arrival in a theatre
india,not_removed,enjoy it with piracy in your home ftfy
india,not_removed,you can say chutia to the govt
india,not_removed,yes and one of them might be me too time to get fit so that i can atleast break a few bones if such a need arises
india,not_removed,always remember sc was the first to cuck out during the emergency
india,not_removed,yes this rule been there in mh for around years
india,not_removed,noted down to be passed in the winter session
india,not_removed,nooooo
india,not_removed,i like that extend it to every court hearing at all levels dogfood their policies to themselves
india,not_removed,swines should do this first then theyll understand the pointlessness
india,not_removed,i had the same doubt but this is more like a directive principle to the legislature and i already see government spokespersons nalin kohli welcoming the move on tv because no govt let alone bjp would risk going against such a patriotic directive so i guess it would be implemented
india,not_removed,kek
india,not_removed,nah i dont wanna miss anti somking ads
india,not_removed,gonna have to pull a colin kaepernick kinda protest then
india,not_removed,i also like to live dangerously
india,not_removed,patriot overreactions you mean murder
india,not_removed,shilpa shetty suggested animal farm a few days ago
india,not_removed,well not true in our school it was only jan event rest of the time we had itni shakti hume dena data etc
india,not_removed,same here only one day in week was reserved for national songvande matram and i studied in a chrisitian convent school
india,not_removed,still dumb
india,not_removed,i have seen a couple of sports games in the us and i can confirm that forced patriotism was extremely cringeworthy and i definitely had a laugh at the expense of my american friends
india,not_removed,i guess a judge should be aware of not letting emotion and sentiments come in the way so perhaps the question is does this judge has it in him to be a judge
india,not_removed,bingo it will be played at theaters across the world this is the mutated version
india,not_removed,it is just an interim order what does that mean this shit will expire or what
india,not_removed,the general public were not allowed to hoist indian flag before not true my schools used to hoist them for all functions and on independence day but anyways doesnt matter we are digressing from the actual matter here
india,not_removed,yep its definitely a very very bad direction to be headed
india,not_removed,national flag tramp stamps for women doggystyle will be the most patriotic position
india,not_removed,antarctica
india,not_removed,signing up for mars one
india,not_removed,there is no such thing as a truly liberal nation my friend
india,not_removed,you always have sympathizers the judges all voted for someone
india,not_removed,dont stand then sit down and keep stuffing your face with popcorn i feel like standing up for the national anthem so i will you do you homeboy
india,not_removed,that is by far the scariest part of this judgement this is bullshit according to the supreme court we are not citizens of a free country fucking nonsense
india,not_removed,scariest part lets all dress in the exact same clothes itll instill a sense of community
india,not_removed,forcing them to stand up is counter productive it will lead them to hate the national anthem out of annoyance
india,not_removed,ting ting ting upvote
india,not_removed,mandatory to play the amma song or they do it out of fear of amma sycophants
india,not_removed,yes and amma gets huge cheer whenever she appears on big screen nobody here in tn knows mukesh and firangis in vicco ads top kek amma
india,not_removed,oh yeah crappy video songs praising amma and her social welfare schemes cringeworthy stuff
india,not_removed,specifically
india,not_removed,the flagpole works maybe
india,not_removed,bhutan seems to be doing pretty well despite its dark past
india,not_removed,hmm also i think before hearing every case in court the anthem should be played each time and the judges should rise up and pay respect to the anthem when it is played so that it would instill a sense of committed patriotism and nationalism and judges will provide proper verdicts and faster closing of long pending cases
india,not_removed,unless you meant something different i think he means the increase of patriotism but not deep down inside just on the surface
india,not_removed,straight outta orwell
india,not_removed,it was more likely httpwegertfamiliedehomeenglishhtml who worked at the dockyard where the photo is taken he didnt salute because it was sunday and his personal motto was you should obey god more than men turns out he had even more kulcha than the nazis
india,not_removed,touche
india,not_removed,what about suhaagraats fuddi maarne se pehle bhi kya anthem gaana padega honest and innocent question vaisey shaadi ho chuki hey meri
india,not_removed,sauce

india,not_removed,thats the point buddy rss didnt want to hoist the national flag even during important events and independence day before because they did not recognize that
india,not_removed,no escape huh
india,not_removed,sorry for the angry comment ive had a bad day my point is this why are people so bothered about the national anthem when they arent as bothered about the mukesh ad both are a piece of media ignore the anthem like so many people ignore the ad
india,not_removed,we were partially close to china situation since but now we are dangerously similar to them in so many aspects when it comes to rights and freedom

india,not_removed,iirc rss shakas used to hoist tricolour on special occasions at my place so maybe this is just a policy followed at nagpur
india,not_removed,im not bothered about the anthem i am bothered about people forcing me to do things which should come from within i think thats easy enough to get i should think besides what is the mukesh ad i have no idea
india,not_removed,that is being done in wb also all the roads have pavements marked in blue and white even the buildings with blue and white paint will get tax reductions this was questioned by the hc once i dont remember exactly
india,not_removed,this is tamil nadu
india,not_removed,seriously somebody needs to do something about this shit
india,not_removed,well i dont blame the old lady if she cant stand but lol they stopped the anthem is funny
india,not_removed,im seriously beginning to get worried if this asshole is going to relinquish power in look whats going on in south korea our population is nowhere as united or educated well be fucked
india,not_removed,from a different article further the bench said people must show respect to the national anthem and the national flag and called it imperative to show them honour and respect the court said that when the anthem is played in movie halls it should be accompanied with images of the national flag on screen and people must stand up it however clarified that the disabled would be exempt
india,not_removed,hotstar doesnt do it out of some moral code they do it because they are afraid of govt litigation in the future

india,not_removed,can i file a case against her
india,not_removed,a as fun as it is lets all not get into the habit of calling the pmo an asshole unless extremely warranted this was an issue when the previous pm was in power and was deplorable then and should be deplorable now b we are always fucked in that you are spot on i wish i had better newws it was the case before and is the case now i have no idea what we can do but the only hope is to make it ok for a less emotional conversation to occur this means supporters becoming immune or angry at emotional manipulation this is a long and near impossible task but it must be done c in all elections our polity has never been united or educated – all things considered this is both good and bad it means that its very hard for one party to go forward without listening to the needs of other groups d because of point c above its almost always been about how the policy documents and policy actions lack or lavish detail and foresight – this means people being active at the white paper stages or at the open policy stages and fighting against regulatory capture this can be achieved on this forum and elsewhere e to achieve and correctly managed point d people need to have the time and knowledge to understand simplify accurately and disseminate important policy information in a manner that doesnt divide us further us being the english speaking population online in short – were more than fucked getting out is still relatively easy it just involves bridges instead of bonfires

india,not_removed,when the national anthem is played it is imperative for everyone to show honour and respect it would instill a sense of committed patriotism and nationalism it said time has come for people to realise that the national anthem is a symbol of constitutional patriotismpeople must feel they live in a nation and this wallowing individually perceived notion of freedom must gopeople must feel this is my country my motherland justice misra said httpwwwlivelawinnationalanthemmustmoviestheatressc

india,not_removed,bribing the trai to keep broadband defintion as kbps is crude whoa is it true
india,not_removed,post fup a speed of is a bloody joke do they not understand that from mbps to it looks even more ridiculous secondly they should have atleast considered a download limit of when you got a dl speed of mbps data is gonna get consumed crazy fast too
india,not_removed,nice just wondering how much does it cost you
india,not_removed,aced it p
india,not_removed,it is times the average internet speed in india thats pretty great unless you are trying to compare with rich first world countries
india,not_removed,dude please read the article
india,not_removed,yep infact chortel had proposed that the bband speeds be set to or similarly lower bloody dogs bsnl itself had started giving as basic speed even post fup there is no doubt that they had the understanding but this cartel has got the things to stall
india,not_removed,they bribe through a consortium cashed coai
india,not_removed,better than airtel tho airtel post fup speed is kbps when they called me for a new connection i sweared at them for being so isp they closed my request as not available in locality and week later they called again the cycle repeated for weeks then some girl finally closed ticket
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,it great but i was expecting something that not many isps can provide considering jio fiber will be rolled out in metro cities first they wont have much to offer there are already isps which give great speeds at low prices
india,not_removed,not they wanted it to be lowered to yes
india,not_removed,arey yaar why to look at that crap laced company what chortel is doing is hardly a parameter for comparison i hope reliance and others get some sense in their heads and mark as basic govttrai is in the cartels pocket
india,not_removed,whoa wow
india,not_removed,not they wanted it to be lowered to was for mobile network not for broadband
india,not_removed,checked again it was for broadband theres no minimum speed in mobile internet as far as i know jio becomes kbps after gb data

india,not_removed,im quite fond of ramachandra guhas india after gandhi
india,not_removed,discovery of india by nehru is great its got the history of india basically from the beginning plus you do learn a bit about his thoughts etc etc its quite brief though so obviously it would be good if you can get more focused books if youre really interested in certain parts indias struggle for independence and india since independence by bipin chandra is quite good too since if youre learning about history the independence struggle is paramount and jln doesnt really talk much on it since he was literally in it when the book was written gandhi and nehru by chalapathi rau is good but you should also look at some books on the indiraera to see the shattering of the nehruvian dream also i recommend looking at some of the ncert books again theyre for students but personally i find them very informative fiction so that you can know about india hm im quite unsure how it might help unless i know where exactly youre moving to like indian authors write about vastly different worlds within india with arundathi roy god of small things you get to see a kerala village while with books by rohinton mistry you get to see something like bombay slumdog millionaire set in delhi kanthapura set in tamilnadu every setting is very different worlds within a world so i may not be able to recommend fiction also i dont know any good books about maharashtra post partition but theres such a long journey by mistry that directly explores the effect of shiv sena separation etc on a single family good authors nevertheless remain vikram seth rohinton mistry shashi tharoor he writes non fiction too some books on india itself v useful jl nehru for history and political writing m chalapathi rau arundhati roy rushdie raja rao narayanan mt vasudevan nair mulk raj anand for a good look at caste any way good luck with coming to india its pretty great you want to research us in such depth

india,not_removed,unfortunately for people who are curious like you india is extremely diverse for a few books to describe it there are hundreds of languages too many religions customs and traditions it is surprising that we are one country if you want to prepare yourself just know that almost everything changes with the location something that is true in north india for example may not be in south this includes food preference the way people dress the mannerisms etc i feel you will do better if you dont come with partial information from a book and always remember that what ever you think indians are like it will be only true with respect to the places you visited and people you encountered there is no possible way to learn about the whole country in one lifetime
india,not_removed,india after gandhi freedom at midnight discovery of india my experiments with truth pax indica swami vivekanadas books for rightist perspectives imaginig india apj abdul kalam books regarding indias vision books on ancient india by romila thapar argumentative indian india a history by john keay is also goodhavent read it though it also depends on what specific aspect are you looking for
india,not_removed,start with discovery of india by jawaharlal nehru then slowly make your way to more modern meluha trilogy in between lies books by ramchandra guha khuswant singh munshi premchand nirala ruskin bond to name a few sorted by historical impact as mentioned by others india is too diverse so if you let me know which part of india and which era you are more interested in i can give better recommendations
india,not_removed,early india from the origins to ad book by romila thapar one of the most fascinating books about indias history that ive read
india,not_removed,all responses here suggest english books op do you know any indian languages they are usually very different in themes and tones from english ones but again you wont find many randians who are good readers in even their own native languages
india,not_removed,gujarat files by rana ayyub the story of an undercover journalist exposing how our current pm for away with murder and genocide
india,not_removed,india after gandhi oh man it has been a while since i read that book it was an enlightening book to say the least i would also highly recommend this book
india,not_removed,also saw this recommended by raskhistorians so i bought it thanks
india,not_removed,this is a really wonderfully thorough response thank you
india,not_removed,thanks for the suggestion
india,not_removed,thanks for your thoughts sorry if ive misrepresented but im not out to get india just by reading or come into my new home thinking i understand everything just because ive read things but i dont know that i agree that having no knowledge is better than having some if the some i end up with i carry humbly knowing its not at all a full picture of any place i go im reading midnights children about the partition at the moment and i already feel really glad to be doing so in spite of the fact that i know whatever opinions im forming along the way arent whole ones with that in mind any recommendations if im going to be living in maharashtra again not trying to understand the entire country through or books just excited about my move and hoping to learn more about even or tiny pockets before i head over
india,not_removed,yeah i really didnt mean to give the impression that im out to fully comprehend india through books but it still feels helpful to read at least a little im reading a book about partition and jinnah and nehru right now thats really interesting and if nothing else helping me realize how little i know about any part of india currently
india,not_removed,make your way to more modern meluha trilogy please if you have any common sense you would not recommend the meluha books beyond the idiotic plot and mindless butchering of characters the books are just terribly written with poor grammar flow and horrible editing i judge people who love such books more than those that love chetan bhagat op would be wise to not follow such advice
india,not_removed,this is great thanks maharashtra postpartition especially if thats helpful
india,not_removed,im learning hindi so happy to get some suggestions there if you have any for when im more fluent
india,not_removed,duuuude really op is asking for books to introduce himher to indian history and you are recommending gujrat files its i cant even its like recommending book on tiananmen square if somebody wants to know history of china
india,not_removed,no worries haha im a returnee grew up entirely outside india before moving back so i can relate to the need to know good luck anyway
india,not_removed,learn about marathi people especially shivaji and the maratha empire those are very important people and history to the marathi people that will be your hosts so you should definitely brush up on that
india,not_removed,lol let op decide what he likes i would definitely recommend meluha trilogy as well as chetan bhagats books they are famous indian authors and had sold over million copies just because you dont like it doesnt mean they are bad there must be some reason why they sold million copies their novels are liked by a lot of indians that should mean something no reason why we should be elitist
india,not_removed,then i will highly recommend shantaram by gregory david roberts this books is about an aussie prisoner who came to bombay illegally and settled in one of the slums of bombay this book gives a different view of bombay do you know marathi
india,not_removed,i really just asked about understanding india better books about current events seem just as good as anything else no
india,not_removed,that book is terrible it almost entirely talks about everything except for the actual regular people and things that really make up the city and state i think its probably heavily embellished as well it makes a nice fictional adventure book though
india,not_removed,yes books about current events are just as good but this particular book is controversial to say the least you will need a lot of context political and social understanding of india under first bjp rule somebody did a nice review of this book in this subreddit you might want to take a look at that before buying this one also this subreddit if you dont know already has people from different camps trying to further their agenda people from one camp calling others modi bhakts and this camp calls everybody else anti national amidst all this it is difficult to get a fair recommendation of books on indian history also ops second line is a complete give away that heshe belongs to the antimodi camp
india,not_removed,that book is extrely biased and i do not recommend reading it before you completely know the context and and are up to date about anything mentionsd in the book for example hedleys testimony alleging that ishrat jahan was actually a member of a terrorist org
india,not_removed,yep that makes lots of sense i thought you might be getting at the pro and anti modi debate originally but i think i got thrown off by the tiananmen square analogy thanks for clarifying
india,not_removed,there were someone who resigned after one such accident there are others who are glued to their seats either fevicol has become stronger or they dont make honest politicians anymore
india,not_removed,super londay is awesome my favorite video of theirs
india,not_removed,what the actual fuck is this propaganda day in and day out if these chutiyas believe so much in their cool aid then why do they not criticize modi for being soft on pakistan
india,not_removed,india had trained ltte at the earliest stage after it backfired rajiv gandhi sort of reversed the policy or whatever support it was providing muktibahini was also in part trained by india this however will no fall under the more familiar notion of terrorism also read this after prime minister rajiv gandhi ordered retaliation against the isi arming khalistani terrorists raw set up the covert counter intelligence teamx and counter intelligence teamj to target pakistan and the khalistanis respectively each khalistani terror attack was met with retaliatory attacks in lahore multan and karachi through citx the role of our covert action capability in putting an end to the isis interference in punjab by making such interference prohibitively costly is little known former raw officer b raman wrote in
india,not_removed,yeah we really believe that because we have complete faith and trust in our governments inefficiency and inefficacy
india,not_removed,people bole toh a selective sample that you cherrypicked i ask because if you do cherry pick you can find a group of people who believe anything including nonsense like india and pakistan are equally to blame for the current conflict but to answer your question india has not sponsored acts of terrorism against pakistan many of us are well aware of the history of the troubles in sri lanka well enough though
india,not_removed,sources
india,not_removed,nice try musharraf
india,not_removed,ah yes use donald trumps tactics he used the same argument to justify russia the irony is too damn funny
india,not_removed,yeah lol
india,not_removed,no what we believe is that we are doing it for the right reasons god is on our side in those fights
india,not_removed,who is people
india,not_removed,it is who are gullible people are intelligent even if they know they dont advertise it in loud speaker because they are managing the perception
india,not_removed,many of us are well aware of the history of the troubles in sri lanka well enough though thats not an act of terror
india,not_removed,looks to be a case of the habitual offender pointing guilty fingers at others

india,not_removed,wut
india,not_removed,you forgot to say allah hu akbar
india,not_removed,god bless america bhi bol do
india,not_removed,act of terror would be putting it mildly literally trained ltte folks in india and flooded them back thats cia level of fucking with another country
india,not_removed,in the ltte cadres were being trained in camps in tn and kerala with official sanction it was only later that india stepped in to clean up that mess
india,not_removed,all that is not an act of terror ofcourse excluding those that are
india,not_removed,looks like its his own ass this time
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,your definition of act of terror is pretty screwed up
india,not_removed,are you saying ltte were not terrorists
india,not_removed,are you saying ltte were not terrorists when did i say that what i did say for that you need to read the entire history of how and when things happened
india,not_removed,your definition of act of terror is pretty screwed up i inferred from this did you mean something else

india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,and had the germans and japanese won you maybe living in the japanese raj today
india,not_removed,a bhakt might tell you that what with the other gandhicongress slowed down independence bull they keep spouting just point these idiots to the war crimes japanese committed on andaman its sad the true heros are the indians who fought in for the allies ironically today no one remembers them not allied nations and not even ina obsessed indians
india,not_removed,his accent isnt faked in tokyo trial as far as i can see it seems like a naturalenough indian accent that he uses in interviews and the like
india,not_removed,he has a point why is allied crimes against civilians and pows were never investigated or kept on trail japanese have their reasons to love him but his conclusion is righteous
india,not_removed,reading the wikipedia page on the guy would help he doesnt let japan off he declares class a war criminals not guilty of crimes under an ex post facto law ie law passed declaring an action a crime after it has been done the same legal principles exist in indian and western laws for criminal not civil matters he also says that the japanese did no more crimes than other parties to the war such as usa bombings of nagasaki and hiroshima or churchills infamous bengal famine he doesnt talk about the famine thats my example lots more but it would be best to read the wiki am on mobile so sorry for the formatting errors etc edit uindianopolice shared a link of a nice nyt article worth a read

india,not_removed,well thanks to modern scholars we have now records particularly books by yasmin khan srinath raghavan and daniel marston now if only the contributions of the british indian army in could be popularized in national consciousness
india,not_removed,why would mahatama ghandhi ji bhakts say that
india,not_removed,perhaps oc is the only one
india,not_removed,japanese were on a whole other level were talking cannibalism and human experimentation allieds were bastards too of course after all america let nazi scientists and japanese experimenters go scottfree in exchange for research
india,not_removed,well its all speculation really but ive always under the belief that had germanyjapan won they wouldnt let bose have india for himself either bose works as a surrogate or japan just takes it for themselves
india,not_removed,so true for a start we should stop portraying them as traitors and maybe more realistic about who the ina was collaborating with my textbook portrayed the japanese as some kind of trustworthy friends of india or something very few people know about the crimes they committed and how cynically hitlertojo regarded bose
india,not_removed,he acknowledge their crimes and many of said crimes were covered in other trials there was no single trial that decided the fate of everyone involved while its true that japanese nationalists have distorted his actual opinion it doesnt mean he didnt have a point
india,not_removed,yeah pretty much there is no moral high ground for both the parties
india,not_removed,the issue is that the idea of ina good and bia bad has become so deeply entrenched in the national consiouscness that anyone who attempts to correct this would literally be commiting political suicide indian troops fought in eritrea sudan egyptitalyjapan vietnamindonesiaburma and in india itself and suffered casualties hell the many soldiers who refused to join ina were tortured killed and eaten by the japanese in a way this is quite reflective of the psychethis is broad sweeping and generalising we prefer to listen to our feels than look at the hard facts fun fact in srinath raghavans book an anecdote is mentioned after the end of war the british commisoned a writer to document the indian contribution to the second world war this writer when he met a minister who could help he got this reply we dont care this was not our war you know who was the first to write about india in the second world war a german professor johannes voight in his german book indien im zweiten weltkrieg
india,not_removed,thats interesting i didnt know about the german professor my pitiful knowledge comes from india in page on wikipedia its just so startling how modern indians are being swept up in nationalism this is becuse our education system does such a poor job of teaching and especially the holocaust if there was ever a time to rehabilitate the indian allied soldiers in our history its now besides that i really feel reclaiming that part of our history will make us more aware how connected india has always been with the rest of the world on another note i read so many horror stories of indian soldiers being eaten by the japanese that really should be in our history books in a childteen friendly way of course maybe not directly mentioning cannibalism

india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,he is implying that subsidy wont be passed on to the intended audience or that he will inflate the figures for his benefit both of which are really plausible in our country
india,not_removed,because there are environmental reasons plus you cant bring all states together due to politics
india,not_removed,some examples that i am aware of each river has different fauna for example imagine ganga has a type of predatory fish that is in balance with other fish in the ganga if ganga is merged into eg mahanadi the predatory fish might actually gorge on another defenseless fish that is native to the mahanadi river the fish in mahanadi might actually be wiped out merging these river might require the construction of dams or other major structures and this might cause displacement of animal life in that area maybe even tribals who live in that area assume there is a water borne disease that starts spreading over the distance a particular river travels now this distance would dramatically increases with river water merging spread of other water based parasites like hyacinth might get accelerated the problem is that it is very difficult to project what might happen and we do not have simulation models or tech to actually predict and prepare for the consequences of such a major geographical change
india,not_removed,sirbuilding canals aint a easy thingdifferent rivers are on different altitudes and terrains balancing all that out using locks and other stuff is a huge project and considering the burecracy in our country it will take years to get everything done
india,not_removed,what environmental reasons
india,not_removed,so the main roadblock is bureaucracy
india,not_removed,it fucks up the ecology look up aral sea which russia tried to engineer by changing river courses you can never predict what is going to happen silt can accumulate from one place to another what about animals who are endemic to one area like the endangered gadgets sea dolphin or gharial and of course the costs would be fucking enormous it can be put to better use by rationalising water usage the problem of floods and droughts have solutions and interlinking rivers is not one of them the courts judgement in this regard was uninformed and plain stupid
india,not_removed,hell yeah
india,not_removed,coming soon shops banks and malls the cabinet on wednesday considered a new model law that would allow malls cinema halls restaurants shops banks and other such workplaces to be open around the clock for days in a year the model law which will now be sent to all states would enable women to work during the night in shops and establishments with mandatory cab services and other workplace facilities for them women to be permitted during night shift if the provision of shelter rest room ladies toilet adequate protection of their dignity and transportation etc exists labour and employment ministry said in a statement the model law will be a readymade material for the state governments as this has taken shape after several rounds of extensive consultation within various ministries and the cabinet labour secretary shankar aggarwal told the hindu with flexibility available to retailers to open their establishment not only thousands of additional skill jobs will be added but it will also make the retail markets across the country very vibrant giving customers flexibility and convenience to shop anytime said krish iyer president and ceo walmart india here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,can they open govt offices and banks why cant cabinet think about it
india,not_removed,hopefully this gives the smaller independent films a decent chance at the box office
india,not_removed,yes its part of uttara kanda the final chapter of ramayana its widely regarded that along with bala kanda the first chapter the interesting thing is if you remove these two chapters what would be called original ramayana would look like an adventurous novel and its these two chapters which talk about valmiki ram being an avatar of vishnu dharmas and more patriarchal things so its alleged that the addition of these chapters could have been done when the society became more religious patriarchal and casteoriented
india,not_removed,the great kuvempus is based on this story great play well worth a read and like in neil gaimans sandman series death is a woman here
india,not_removed,posts about religion are not allowed on rindia as per the rules
india,not_removed,what does this have to with india
india,not_removed,did you also know that in all versions of the ramayan ram makes sita walk through fire to prove her purity its hardly news or surprising that a major religious story acts as a charter myth what is the source on the shambuka story what is your motivation for putting this up do you have anything to gain from this except trolllols when was this part of the ramayan created is it present in both major branches of the ramayan in india stop being a daehatecastelol idiot and add some bloody context into your tils youve learned nothing except another soundbite rationalization for your biases you are the worst rant edit in defense of uheisthecow its suprizingly hard to post a link with additional commentary do i wish hed added more color to it definitely did i overreact toooootally hes not the worst i am
india,not_removed,it is just an epic without any truth attached to it so chill pill
india,not_removed,there wasnt a concept of equality of all humans years back so its pointless to blame age old scriptures for regressiveness weve evolved as a society
india,not_removed,and the antihindu bias in this shitty subreddit continues
india,not_removed,funny arguments rama is viewed antidalit because he killed shambuka but not viewed as antibrahmin because he killed ravana
india,not_removed,a guy kills a boy the killer decides to repent for his sin by doing penance but the king decides to punish the killer by beheading him because the king feels that just penance cannot wash away the killers deed see if you read it like that it does not sound so bad but when you attach the casts of the people involved it becomes inflammatory story remains the same it is the way you tell it
india,not_removed,bala kanda and uttara kanda are brahminical approved supposedly added during the gupta age
india,not_removed,oh yeah an interesting thing about the epics is that they can be regressive and progressive at the same time because they were written and edited by people with varying agendas its a reflection of the diversity in indian thought of that time
india,not_removed,sometimes rindia surprises and impresses me with such insightful comments thank you
india,not_removed,youre right but also wrong in believing in a original ramayana it was always a very fluid text and only written down relatively recently
india,not_removed,some sources for this whole when the society became more religious patriarchal and casteoriented would be nice
india,not_removed,maryada purushottam is this like adarsh balak of
india,not_removed,yes ramas mental dilemma would be interesting to see the story of shabri actually indicates that he was against caste the avatars are flawed beings krishna admits it in the mahabharata only most people do not see them as such rama does not sound like an ideal man in this instance at all despite what the society of that time thought understanding his motive is not castist as long as you dont agree with it
india,not_removed,not being castist but it is important to remember that rama was called maryada purushottam for a reason he would follow the practices of the time to the letter just no just because its prevalent doesnt make it uttam islam apologists use the same logic to defend their child fucker
india,not_removed,lol you mean to say being casteist was maryada
india,not_removed,if thats your only defense then too bad
india,not_removed,i found this interesting because ive as always thought of ram as someone who was often bound by rules but at the same time someone who stood against injustice this incident seems a bit too much at least with sita he himself knew she was not actually in danger the source is the valmiki ramayana and my motive is to have an interesting conversation i love the epics but the avatars are not perfect and i wish more people know that furthermore the epic has been edited by people with different agendas so there is nothing wrong with some critical thinking the epics are not infallible i dont know what has caused such a strong reaction in you caste is a sensitive topic but unfortunately it must be discussed religion too must be discussed and criticised for it to develop many hindus take pride in the open mindedness of hinduism
india,not_removed,cant there be tils on mythologyfiction if someone says george lucas had an alternate storyline for star war series people will go gaga on the internet and here is a guy simply sharing something with a wikipedia link it is not a research topic for god sake which i am sure most wouldnt know you have a problem with that wtf
india,not_removed,wtf how does this have gross upvotes
india,not_removed,and isnt rama criticised for doing that to his own wife its almost always shown as a negative aspect of ramas personality
india,not_removed,the problem appears when a lot of people do take it as truth and as a rule book but i was just chilling and looking for an interesting discussion
india,not_removed,so chill pill if only case in point cow protectors its just a fucking animal
india,not_removed,everything is political except politics politics is about power
india,not_removed,the problem is that these scriptures claim to teach the morals that an ideal man should have and it claims divine inspiration god should know better
india,not_removed,however posts about hinduism islam or any other religion belong to their specific subreddits not on rindia this is the exact rule from the sidebar
india,not_removed,do you think hinduism cannot take even a small amount of criticism does it need special treatment your persecution comples is showing
india,not_removed,i think i missed the part where ravan was innocently praying and rama killed him because brahmins shouldnt be allowed to do those rituals new version
india,not_removed,ravana wasnt killed because he was a brahmin shambuka was killed because he was a dalit
india,not_removed,i want to rape your innocence and go to jail
india,not_removed,well if the reason for him killing the boy was his caste and you remove it then it is pretty fucking dumb to tell the story
india,not_removed,men kill other men in revenge for being bombed by drones see if you read it like that it does not sound so bad but when you attach the religion of the people involved it becomes inflammatory
india,not_removed,whos to say which version is crooked
india,not_removed,i dont know how you could get more violent than the popular mahabharata where bhim rips out intestines of his enemies to wear around his neck or more sexual than arjun being almost molested by an apsara not to mention the sexual connotations with horses in the ashwamedha ritual the story is old none of the versions are the original not even the one by vyasa
india,not_removed,yeah you are right i actually meant earlier version when i wrote original
india,not_removed,did you read the link in my comment given the language and tone of these first and last books they clearly come from a later linguistic and more importantly a later theological period when vishnu has become a deity who has avataras a deity who acts in the world for the benefit of human beings this he does by saving dharma in various ways usually by killing those who perpetuate adharma for example ravana there is a noticeable difference in the way the story now reacts to socalled transgressions of dharma by women and lower castes
india,not_removed,society became casteist during the gupta period according to genetic evidence inter caste marriages stopped httpindianexpresscomarticleindiaindianewsindiageneticstudysuggestscastebegantodictatemarriagefromguptareign
india,not_removed,adarsh balak is chill maryada purushottam is kill low caste peoples
india,not_removed,everything contrarian is brushed off as vishnu maya
india,not_removed,yes and even though he knew that his wife was sacred not even touched by ravan he still expatriated her from his kingdom citing reasons that common people objected her being the wife of their lord so he bent to the wishes of his subjects he was perfect embodiment of the society at that time obviously present society with its changed worldview would see him with the different shade of glasses
india,not_removed,yep thats my veiw its important to realise the concept of maryada purushottam was ironically flawed itself
india,not_removed,original version of log kya kahenge
india,not_removed,ram was still the king and the one with the authority to carry this out the dhobi just talked rama actually went and carried it out the majority of the responsibility of this action is still on him
india,not_removed,no after returning from lanka ram immediately made sita undergo a purity test by walking over fire later because of what he heard from the washerman through his spy he straightaway banishes her into this forest and finally after he is about to take her back again after hearing lava and kusha recite valmiki ramayana he conducts the fire test once again during which she disappears into the folds of mother earth
india,not_removed,alright so maaaaybe i overreacted im just tired of people sending out unsupported unsourced links out into the internet without their due diligence ponniyanselvans answer is a much better starting point for a conversation sending a naked link out on a highly political forum just looks like trolling and yes caste and religion absolutely must be discussed ideally with people who disagree with you not your own echo chamber
india,not_removed,my running theory is that its right wing nutjobs who think im defending ram and the ramayan
india,not_removed,rhinduism
india,not_removed,thats the tragedy of our country
india,not_removed,the problem appears when a lot of people do take it as truth and as a rule book what lot of people i did not even know this till you posted about it
india,not_removed,a lot of people believe them to be so i consider them literature rather good ones
india,not_removed,divine inspiration wtf are you on about dude ramayana is a year old literature with thousands of different versions from thousands of writers over two millennia it isnt the quran which is word from god its a story so people modify it to suit their needs they are versions where ram is an outright villain while ravana is the hero in older times with no tvs or printing press these were the shows ramayana and mahabharata were their shaaktiman and spiderman who teaches their children about how rama killed a dalit shambuka do people still practice sati like in mahabharata what exactly is your point omg rama is so backward boycott ramayana this is like saying goku is a horrible father so boycott dbz did you know that goku was never present for his children
india,not_removed,that is criticism of iran not islam
india,not_removed,that is directly related to india this isnt
india,not_removed,however posts about hinduism islam or any other religion belong to their specific subreddits not on rindia this is the exact rule from the sidebar the top post is a news you are not seeing anyone cry bias about diwali posts because they are news whereas your post should not have been allowed acc to rules but it has been allowed
india,not_removed,yeah in fact rama had plenty of reservations about killing ravana just because he was a brahmin
india,not_removed,shambuka was not killed because he was just dalit if that was the case why didnt ram kill every other dalit the version of the story i heard is an official from rams court linked an omen an young boy killed by a chariot and died before the eyes of his parent and argued that shambuka was doing a type of puja which was not allowed he urged ram being king and all to correct this aberration by killing shambuka i say it is a funny argument because we are trying to judge action of character in the past from the todays values
india,not_removed,i dont remember people of mumbai bombing people of pakistan using drones
india,not_removed,probably because ch was pronounced k back then sorry
india,not_removed,so he bent to the wishes of his subjects yes but that is a pretty weak thing for a king to do everyone wants different and contradictory things how many will he bow down to
india,not_removed,लोलवा for your imagination
india,not_removed,that is because people talk of ram rajya where they show the qualities of an ideal king and not an ideal husband to a king all his subjects are equal and therefore he has to take heed of what the general rules prevalent at the time if he does not then it would look like nepotism the practice i am talking about is for the wife to demonstrate her purity and not the exact agnipariksha per se
india,not_removed,rindia is definitely not an echo chamber on this issue
india,not_removed,damn
india,not_removed,that sub is mostly filled westerners who think hinduism is about being in a cult
india,not_removed,apparently oldpeoplefacebook type people claiming ram setu is real makes ramayana literally quran
india,not_removed,if you think this is fictional then what is the problem here imjust sharing an interesting fact about a piece of fiction
india,not_removed,do you know how to read if yes then read the rule again it specifies hinduism and doesnt leave it for debate whether its a religion or not
india,not_removed,this is criticism of ram not hinduism
india,not_removed,ramayana is not directly related to india now ive heard everything
india,not_removed,if the only defense for your religion is to go crying to the mods i dont know what to say im hindu tooi say we recognize flawschange and move on
india,not_removed,shambuka was not killed because he was just dalit if that was the case why didnt ram kill every other dalit he was a dalit doing a brahmins job why wont rama kill him then the version of the story i heard is an official from rams court linked an omen an young boy killed by a chariot and died before the eyes of his parent and argued that shambuka was doing a type of puja which was not allowed not allowed because he was a dalit i say it is a funny argument because we are trying to judge action of character in the past from the todays values we judge jesus christ muhammad and every other god based on their actions why should it change for rama
india,not_removed,majority wanted it not a few here and there
india,not_removed,so ram rajya is blindly carrying out general rules prevalent at the time no change for the better wtf were they waiting for all these years
india,not_removed,to be honestletting yourself get influenced by gossip seems like something a weak king would do
india,not_removed,because you are twisting something for your own agendas
india,not_removed,except you said that it is divinely inspired ramayanas are written by men and no how inspired by god infact there is no one big god dude in hinduism
india,not_removed,you argument is weak you and i can critic irans political elite on certain practices as it is a political institution not a religious one meaning neither of us would be antiislam in doing so to compare you can criticize the indian government for beef banning without being antihindu as you are being critical of the political not the religious establishment but on the other hand if i criticize islam for social evils held by the radicals and not by the majority i will come off as a bigot just as you have in your post
india,not_removed,it is directly related to hinduism otherwise there have been plenty of articles related to indian culture removed by mods because it was not directly related to india
india,not_removed,i dont think anyone here doesnt recognise that the caste system is flawed and should go
india,not_removed,hmm my argument is not about judging my argument is judging people of one age with value system of different age eerily i had a similar argument about why we cant judge muhammad marrying a old with todays world view
india,not_removed,during those days what they did was the better
india,not_removed,i dont like sarcasm being forced where it does not belong
india,not_removed,i have never in my post said that the majority of hindus follow this i was just pointing out a specific section of the text because i found it surprising
india,not_removed,you are being critical of hinduism by associating one of the reverent figures in hindu mythology rama with caste system akin to dragging figures of equal reverence in other religion such as muhammad in islam or jesus in christianity with social taboos that exists in their own religion my original comment on the antihindu bias comes on that ground as this subbreddit despite advertising itself as against bigoted post regarding any religion only enforces it when the religion is question isnt hinduism

india,not_removed,many places will disallow indian stags especially if a large part of their crowd comprises foreigners too many assholes thinking a white girl will sleep with anyone and harassing patrons ive never had trouble when im with a girl or even when im alone at my regular hangouts
india,not_removed,never in goa but i have experienced inhospitable service bordering on hostile in some establishments in pondicherry these places were usually owned and managed by foreigners
india,not_removed,theres nothing wrong with face control in clubs no one has the right of entry regular patrons who drop more than random customers need to be happy so theyll keep frequenting the club if they feel like the club isnt selective about who it lets in if they feel like it isnt highend or special anymore the club loses loyal patrons and that isnt good for business
india,not_removed,what is your problem if they have rules for entry
india,not_removed,ive been to few coffee places in pondi where we felt its little odd we couldnt find many indians but we were always given equal service may i know the names of places where youve been given shityy services
india,not_removed,its strange how some of these people still act like india is still under british colonialism in goa and pondicherrys case portugese and french were those who were being hostile towards you the indian waiters or the actual foreigners
india,not_removed,but if high end basically means no indians or this selectivity is on the basis of race then that is pretty much the definition of racism there are no two ways around it i mean if this discrimination was only meted out to working class bachelors from delhi then it would be a different issue but a working class russian tourist who is bald and has tattoos on their head is way more likely to get admission than a rich well dressed young man from mumbai if you dont think said scenario above is seriously messed up considering its our own country then this is just a slave mentality beyond repair which judging from your other posts definitely seems to be the case
india,not_removed,the old tantos pizzeria not the new one on ecr which is managed by indians
india,not_removed,i havent not yet anyway but its something that i have heard around of course this should especially be considered extremely unacceptable if it is foreigners who are the ones meting this prejudice out i havent yet come across a place that has an obvious blanket ban on all indians but i have noticed on websites like trip advisor perhaps more accurately a type of selective racism going on for example if there are hundreds of reviews from both indians and europeans most of the reviews are positive and by indians but there will be around forty extremely negative reviews deriding the service as extremely rude and unwelcoming whereas there are no negative reviews by europeans some establishments which come to mind are bora bora russian owned la plage french owned the reason why i call it selective racism is because going by the reviews its quite obvious that they arent rude with all indians but they are way more likely to be rude to an indian than a european one indian girl on trip advisor even stated that she thought the staff at bora bora were racist it wasnt clear if she meant the indian waiters or the white owners but if it is the latter such should be taken very seriously in my opinion the reason why they think they can push indians around is because they know that indians are very submissive and none confrontational
india,not_removed,its called face control you fool go anywhere in the world youll find it happening indians are very fond of jumping to hurrrrrr thats raceeeest at the drop of a hat slave mentality lmao please enlighten me on this gem not finding ugly people attractive is slave mentality wokay pick up an economics textbook someday itll do you a world of good
india,not_removed,people like darkis have an extreme subservience towards westerners which is why this is allowed to flourish in the first place he would probably be one of these indians to adopt this practice towards his fellow compatriots if he had the chance i dont know why we even got independence from the british raj only for people like this to actively defend the same people more than sixty years later tooth and nail
india,not_removed,its fine grow a skin
india,not_removed,the rules are simple ratio cover or be a recognised regular
india,not_removed,is this the one on road to auroville ive been here and it was fine apart from few stray dogs which were shooed away by the waiters maybe you got unlucky
india,not_removed,in case you have forgotten you are indian yourself and suffer from the same bizarre complex that many middle class indians seem to have in general which centres around the notion of ill temporarily pretend that i am not indian i would say the term slave mentality is quite applicable when it comes to applying it to individuals such as yourself especially judging from your other posts demeaning other indians for the way they speak english because you associate the ability of speaking english with a higher socioeconomic status even though south korea and japan are both first world nations and most of their nationals dont even have a rudimentary comprehension of the english language actively supporting and defending foreign residents who socially discriminate against indians in our own country actually giving advice to other indians of methods on how to lighten their skin complexion need i say more this is uncle tom syndrome in a nut shell an extreme inferiority complex but hey if you want to act condescending derisive bigoted and sarcastic towards your own people in order to compensate for the fact that you wouldnt get accepted in the west thats low but its your pathetic opinion and youre entitled to it enjoy being the social slave of white people i hope it works out for you
india,not_removed,the first time i went there it was fine next two times i couldnt get the menu forget about service and we were just three soft spoken polite people fourth time i went to the one on the main road to pondi and it was fine there
india,not_removed,oh nevermind i see a few negative reviews on zomato i think we got lucky
india,not_removed,uncle tom syndrome is informally widely applied to any ethnic individual who has a subservient mentality towards white people its got nothing to do with being dark and you clearly on some level acknowledge that you do hence why youre getting so defensive and going off on a rambling tangent the girl did ask how to lighten her skin complexion and you gave her objective advice on how to do so and instead youre trying to make out it was for pock marked skin here is the actual question i am the one with the chip on my shoulder about my ethnicity you say well lets compare the two shall we me concerned about whether foreign nationals may be engaging in any form of social discrimination towards my own people in my country you actively defending and supporting foreign nationals who would engage in a discriminatory practice towards indians in india talking of most other indians disdainfully mostly for superficial reasons giving advice to other indians on how to lighten their skin complexion by using bleaching creams hydroquinone more specifically its not about whining its about being naturally deeply offended like pretty much any other ethnic group would be except for a disproportionately high percentage of indians if a bunch of white people more than sixty years after independence monopolised areas and created establishments which enacted a no dogs and no indians policy which someone subservient like yourself actively defends like i said if you want to act derisive and bigoted towards your own people thats low and pathetic but go ahead lets see if it does you any favours at the end of the day youre just like the millions of other indians who are racist against their own people
india,not_removed,really till now i thought id gotten unlucky but yeah i did avoid the place quite a few times it feels especially insulting when you take friends there praising it to high heavens and then you get treated like shit and there are no real alternatives close to that tanto

india,not_removed,apple music is nice
india,not_removed,office rs pm adobe lightroomphotoshop rs pm the economist rs every weeks i used to sub to apple music but stopped because of limited tamil library and lack of access to explicit version of songs

india,not_removed,use cracked version it can even download the songs 😁
india,not_removed,apple music too
india,not_removed,eh selection is still very minimal a colleague of mine and i are going dutch with the service so its not nearly as expensive anymore for what little utility it provides but outside of a select few shows im interested in it actually offers a surprisingly small catalogue almost months into the service not to mention some of the stuff is really well bottom of the barrel went through the documentaries section to see what they had there were atleast four to five of them dedicated to the conspiracy of the moon landing hilariously sitting right next to the new cosmos miniseries and illuminati im thinking of keeping it around a little while longer but if the situation hasnt improved by the end of the year im killing the account
india,not_removed,i used it for one year saved a lot of money in airbnb bookings when holidaying abroad sadly they got rid of the airbnb discount a couple of years ago that was the only really lucrative part i was interested in the restaurant discounts are actually not too bad but we tend to go and try different places every weekend especially newer places so its hard to justify spending money on something like a loyalty card
india,not_removed,if you use it for torrents you will start getting dmca notices and account takedown

india,not_removed,vpsvirtual private server is a virtual computer hosted elsewhere whereas a vpnvirtual private network software is a software that lets you access internet as you were present in a different location
india,not_removed,through my work got office personal for equivalent for the first year
india,not_removed,yes but a paid vpn has its advantages with many different servers to choose from and better latency
india,not_removed,friend does
india,not_removed,why else would it be worth it
india,not_removed,i like apple music but im not happy about two things in particular as far as its collection is concerned a some songs cannot be downloaded as a part of a specific album sometimes theyre straight up not available b they only provide clean versions of songs so no explicit versions have you tried listening to a clean version of a dmx song its like watching game of thrones on star plus the price point is awesome but these are some of the most annoying things about the service if any of these is a major dealbreaker for you just stick with downloading and loading it on the phone but then youll have to deal with itunes on pc shudders
india,not_removed,thats a good news will try that but i think pia is a better option
india,not_removed,man can you help me to get it at the same price broke college student here
india,not_removed,how was your experience
india,not_removed,itunes on pc because fuck you thats why apple do you lose the downloaded songs after your subscription ends
india,not_removed,sorry man i dont think it is even available anymore i received an email at work to signup for personal account at this price as part of our organization office rollout i dont know if we will get a similar price in months when the year runs out
india,not_removed,worth it
india,not_removed,yepall the music u downloaded during the subscription is deleted from ur phoneeven if u sign out of the apple music app accountit gets deleted
india,not_removed,do you lose the downloaded songs after your subscription ends truthfully i havent actually tested to see what happens but as i understand the apple music service you technically only rent them for the duration of your subscription this makes it distinct from buying music from the apple store which you get to keep under ahem certain conditions ie drm personally i use it for the most idiotic reason ever build a legit version of all the ive collected over the years for two specific reasons a i dont want to deal with itunes bullshit i own an old ipad and have had enough shitty experience with itunes to last me a lifetime b i am very particular about album covers and information so getting a copy from apple directly kinda saves me time from sourcing this shit myself because sites dont for the most part aint nobody got the time to go and remove download free music from from my music files
india,not_removed,unfortunately i study in a not very tech savvy medical college so have no edu email address
india,not_removed,ditto plus i have almost connectivity that i just need a place to stream music from and in indiathis has the largest and latest international musicsince i listen to mix of obscure and mainstream ones so thats an added plus
india,not_removed,look up musicbrainz picard
india,not_removed,yeah i was a little albeit unreasonably mad with them a while back because i was on a bit of a vaporwave kick lately because of a post on rvideos and couldnt scratch that sound itch with apple music also since apple doesnt readily allow you to download stuff from the web easily which in is fucking ridiculous i was right pissed at them

india,not_removed,where can i donate for the cleanup effort
india,not_removed,there is a good chance america will go the way of russia in terms of race relationship i see a wave of racism coming across europe and us even longtime friends in liberal cities like seattle and new york have been saying they have felt very unsafe in the last months while there are a lot of americans who welcoming and defend against racism there is rage building up in their right wing is going to burst sometime soon i also hope indian media stops sensationalizing every news story about western women being attacked or raped i am not saying it should not be covered but there has been overcoverage these right wing extremist websites pick up on these news stories and make it seem like indians are raping white women as part of a race war for regular right wing indiansbhakts please stop supporting trump i am not saying this a left winger or pseudo liberal or whatever names you give for opposing your idea but as a human being trump is a monster that you cant get back into the cage he is supporting hate groups with his silence and will make each and every indian abroad unsafe everyday even if trump helps with pakistan it will be for a very short term but the hate trump is brewing will hurt indian identity for decades all across the world
india,not_removed,zee news instigates hatred and violence against indians in india reports on hate crime against indians abroad

india,not_removed,isolated incident no need to panic everythings gonna be all right
india,not_removed,looking at the wiki of the place where this happened peyton co it is a really small village population that puts it into perspective this did not happen in a big city
india,not_removed,who was the indian guy who campaigned for trump
india,not_removed,hate crime happens a lot in the middle statesi dont know why we start getting scared now that its happening to us now america is the country of freedom and equalitywhich means we also have an equal chance to get hated on its something to be expected they hate us now because we havent realized that we are also vulnerable to hate crime and have a reason to hate us im ready for the downvotes
india,not_removed,why the fuck are we concerned about racism in the us when we are being racists in our own backyards
india,not_removed,the federal bureau of investigation is probing into the case which came to light on february peyton in another incident of hate crime in the us a house of an indian man was trashed with eggs dog feces and covered in racial slurs in southern colorado we saw more than papers stuck everywhere on our door window car they smeared dog poop everywhere and they had thrown at least like eggs on our walls on our ceilings everywhere outside the homeowner was quoted as saying by the cbs denver he further said that racial slur like you brown or indian shouldnt be here was also written outside the house the homeowner said despite the hate he was reminded of compassion here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme

india,not_removed,virat hindus with trump all the way to white house
india,not_removed,im curious to see how many assaults there were on indians before trump if anyone has a link if i remember correctly there was a shooting in a gurudwara and a few other similar incidents where they were mistaken for arabs
india,not_removed,randians will still flock to the us at every given moment possible
india,not_removed,no usual hate crimes are just getting more visibility
india,not_removed,was trump in australia when indians got killed was trump in pakistan when indians got killed
india,not_removed,i wonder why do they even bother coming here if they dislike their country
india,not_removed,dalits are of indian population of course absolute numbers will be higher would you prefer to be a black adult man in us or dalit in india is the real question of all black men in usa have been to jail at least once in their life httpsenwikipediaorgwikistatisticsofincarceratedafricanamericanmales
india,not_removed,most of the people not earning well in india will like to be in america even some earning well in india would like to be in us than in india even for a little lesser salary not much ofcourse applies to only working class
india,not_removed,still i would any day prefer being an indian in america than being a dalit in india as a dalit in india you not only enjoy tons of government benefits like scholarships subsidies quotas in jobs admissions liberal laws etc but also get the support of most political parties who are hellbent on appeasing the dalits what do you get by being an indian in america or even england
india,not_removed,what if youre not a dalit would your preference change
india,not_removed,please stay and fight in your own country rather than running away
india,not_removed,oh boy i was planning to move back to frederick to be close to my family maybe i should move more towards ny
india,not_removed,clean chit fringe elements
india,not_removed,trump is a monster that you cant get back into the cage he is supporting hate groups with his silence basically he is a modi
india,not_removed,wonder if trump has investments in the real estatebuilding sector in india someone needs to dig up all the details and air them
india,not_removed,america doesnt owe the indians anything it is their country their rules indians are welcome back in india if they feel things in india are better than in us
india,not_removed,a slight diversion from your point if i may regular right wing indiansbhakts when did regular right wing indians become bhakts one can be a right winger and not suck on modis cock shocking i know please stop supporting trump apart from some idiots in some political parties i dont think anyone supports trump my right wing unkills either dont care or think trump is a shitshow anecdotal but yeah
india,not_removed,for regular right wing indiansbhakts please stop supporting trump tbh indian bhakts who oppose trump are really confusing
india,not_removed,coming across europe first of all mate europe is not one country no need to overexaggerate the bullshit your read on news
india,not_removed,fact overwhelming percentage indian americans votedvote for democrats also american right wing indian right wing modi is a populist but he didnt run on racist rhetoric like donnie boy dont draw parallels where there is none
india,not_removed,chaos mistrust and hate for the plebs in india trust and a sense of community for where i live
india,not_removed,alt right ✌
india,not_removed,shalabh kumar

india,not_removed,its as if people are able to have concern for two or more things simultaneously
india,not_removed,until some actual numbers are released nobody can be sure
india,not_removed,cognitive dissonance i notice this phrase being thrown around quite a lot in this sub but never once have i seen it used it in the right context
india,not_removed,so when people can generalize india why not us
india,not_removed,so i was wondering when youd show up
india,not_removed,youre not american are you please let me know if you are ill keep track of your posts to link to sas and reap some karma
india,not_removed,have you been to the us just for academic purposes ofcourse
india,not_removed,mugga making usa grand and great again
india,not_removed,first they came for the communists and i did not speak out— because i was not a communist then they came for the muslims and i did not speak out— because i was not a muslim then they came for the liberals and i did not speak out— because i dont consider myself a liberal then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me
india,not_removed,kek par wo shulabh hota he
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,there have been plenty remember when cops paralysed a old indian man or when miss universe who was american of indian descent was racially abused even biden said you cannot go to a or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent though i myself am okay with this statement many considered it a negative stereotype and called biden a racist the story went away pretty fast because he was biden i cant even imagine the shitshow this would cause if donny had said something like this
india,not_removed,its still far better than india yes racists are feeling empowered because of trump but in india theres so much brown on brown crime that you still feel much safer walking the clean american streets plus the coasts are where most indians live and those areas are pretty liberal
india,not_removed,saw more racism in pune a sikh guys turban was torn apart from his head and his hair cut by mns even worse shit gets done we just dont hear about it because its so common
india,not_removed,and why do you think that is
india,not_removed,see it is not about flocking to the us it is about image of india and indians around the world if we allow this kind of hatred to spread indians would be treated badly irrespective of the country they go too it is about our self image of india and indians if you dont stand up against racism of people who look like you then dont be surprised if you are standing alone when you face it
india,not_removed,i am simply drawing a correlation when the country is run by someone like trump the innate racism inside those racists bubbles up and thats what seems to be happening the racist fire is catching wind with trumps rhetoric racists will always be there but its when they feel empowered and justified is when you get these problems and we are just getting started no response from trump on these incidents is also worrying and its unlikely he would respond because these racists are his major support if you seriously trying to draw that parallel between australia and my god pakistan then either you are hugely ignorant on the topic or a racist apologist
india,not_removed,i would like to bring you face to face with face with srinivas kuchibhotlas parents and dare you to recite your poem
india,not_removed,ah a rthedumbfuck contributor caught with your pants down outside your safe space buddy
india,not_removed,feels nice to take a dump on the designated shitting thread
india,not_removed,lol depends on wealth imo poor black is better than poor dalit but rich urban dalit is winning the genetic lottery even better than poor white in us
india,not_removed,black in america of course is that even a question dalit discrimination is so real and complete its not even documented at least in the us most level headed people speak up for the rights of black people in india if an upper caste brahmin speaks up for dalit rights hell be called names
india,not_removed,edit oops replied to wrong comment letting it be no no no no no being poor in india is wayyyyyyy better than being poor in america unless you are in some far away cut off area with no food for anyone if youre poor in america youll be homeless because theres no slums as such shelters are terrible soup kitchens are often not sufficient project housing is full of crime its near impossible to raise a kid to be focused on studies in a project jhopadpattis are way better because at least they have some families with a strong desire to move up in life theres healthy food available at very cheap prices in india in the us in even san jose in the heart of silicon valley theres food deserts areas where youll only find fast food people just never have fruit also if you scrape enough together you can make your kid escape the cycle in india by living in a slum and sending your kid to a good school in america you can only go to the school assigned for you and the school is funded by area taxes so if you are in a poor area tough luck you can only go to shitty schools private schools are way out of reach the cycle keeps perpetrating poverty actually becomes a state of mind crab mentality also in india people dont hate poor people and arent scared of them to the extent in america because the poverty in america is very very strongly correlated with drugs and crime so theres more people willing to help you or fund programs that help you also in india politicians fall over each other for the votes of the poor so whatever it is they are not disenfranchised in america republican party tries really hard to use voter id laws to disenfranchise black voters also no one cares for poor peoples votes least of all the poor people themselves its many levels of fucked up you dont want to be poor in america
india,not_removed,as a dalit in india you also enjoy beatings and rapes by upper classes in villages and being discriminated against by many within the urban classes
india,not_removed,and as soon as many indians leave india they revert back to their dalit hating ways in the new country they immigrate to meaning there is no real change that is taking place in the hearts and minds of the average indian as long as indians believe their honour is vicariously passed down by virtue of their great great great granddad being the chief ball fondler of the great sultan of lucknow then dont be surprised that the dalit hating is occurring today the first thing that needs destroying after the caste system is collectivism and the indian family then constituted where grandma and granddad mind their own fucking business and whether they have a son is immaterial because the oogyboogy knee knocker dance done at the funeral is nothing more than a made up load of crap so it doesnt matter whether it is done by a son or daughter
india,not_removed,even i want to know the answer to this question
india,not_removed,not at all in fact that should force one to try even harder to emigrate i think living in the first world is a dream for many but for non dalits its considerably easier to achieve so why not take advantage of an obvious fact duh
india,not_removed,the description did feel awfully familiar
india,not_removed,he has investments in the real estate sector in india one such trump tower is in kalyani nagar pune and in mumbai not sure about mumbai
india,not_removed,indians are welcome back in india this is never going to fly in this sub people will make up new excuses as they go along on why they need to abandon india i even saw people unironically inquiring on the steps needed to be taken to convert to judaism in order to immigrate to israel when the recent news of the latest batch of indian jews being shipped to israel was announced same group of people then smear india and bash on it every second of the day in order to justify their life choices
india,not_removed,yes america does indians who go there do so mostly like and pay their taxes the country owes them safety and security it is the responsibility of all countries to provide safety to all residents especially minorities
india,not_removed,yes they do its like saying western women who get raped in india should stay away if they come anyway indians dont owe them anything what only an utter idiot can make such a remark
india,not_removed,america doesnt consist of only white people this guy may not be american but there are plenty of americans of indian origin
india,not_removed,do you as an indian owe solidarity and support to indians who are victims of hate crime
india,not_removed,this exactly this
india,not_removed,right leaning sites like opindia swarajyamag openly support trump and hail his anti media stance they have glossed over srinivass case by saying it is a crime and has got nothing to do with trump a lot of right leaning people support trump just because he it against liberals
india,not_removed,one can be a right winger and not suck on modis cock shocking i know actually it is shocking there are very few independentminded rightwingers left the personality cult around modi is extremely strong congrats for being the exception to the rule but youre still the exception and so is your family everyone wants to think of themselves as independentminded but few are
india,not_removed,i see it this way there are many well meaning people in the right wing who think trump will be useful to their needs there is also a group that would gladly sell out other indians for the sake of their ideology to succeed by regular i meant the former group people who arent idealogues but who are people who are conservative in their political outlook there is a group of people who are supporting trump in india they are a minority but they are present and they shill the pseudo nationalistic tune of indians should not migrate out of india and indians should not leave india for work indians should not speak in english i dont want people to fall this manufactured nationalism
india,not_removed,why was modi described as a inch hindu hriday samrat in the election campaign
india,not_removed,kashmiris backed by pakistan threw them out
india,not_removed,no it is just that middleclass indians are more concerned about what happens to their ilk in some other country than what happens to the lowerclass people within their country just look at the outcry these incidents have provoked within the media and country compared to a murder or a rape of a dalit in a village
india,not_removed,what thread
india,not_removed,very similar to how the term racism is used in this sub
india,not_removed,dont worry like you im sure most of the people that upvoted that comment missed the point too
india,not_removed,have you been to the us are you fking kidding usa is his motherland
india,not_removed,what does that statement even mean i cant go to donuts if i dont have an indian accent
india,not_removed,i never thought i would hear the phrase brown on brown crimes
india,not_removed,but in india theres so much brown on brown crime that you still feel much safer walking the clean american streets what utter bullshit i have never felt as unsafe or even been a victim of crime as much in pune as i have in the bay area southern california
india,not_removed,plus the coasts are where most indians live and those areas are pretty liberal this happened in denver though denver is one of the most liberal cities in america rivalling seattle austin or sf colorado as a state is also solidly democratic they were among the first to legalise marijuana unlike the last hate crime which happened in a deep redfairly conservative state like kansas this is different of course the harassment of the indian grandpa a few years ago in alabama speaks for itself another deep red state point is if it can happen in a blue state like colorado in a very liberal city like denver it can happen anywhere
india,not_removed,hypothetical question lets say you move to america and suddenly a war breaks out or american economy goes to shit wwyd move back to india because india is the better choice or stay back in the us of a
india,not_removed,have an upvote sir

india,not_removed,ghetto crime in the states is comparable to india but most urban and suburban environments are far safer even for minorities where in socal have you visited
india,not_removed,colorado as a state is also solidly democratic bs colorado is a swing state outside of denver the state is republican haven
india,not_removed,of course it can happen in liberal cities im sure it does but the rates are still far less due to a relatively efficient police force ive never felt unsafe in the us and ive even visited deep red states its still better than a place like delhi where you cant walk half the city after dark
india,not_removed,the tagline on the article mentions peyton colorado not denver peyton is a town of people
india,not_removed,umm im talking about the us not europe gun laws are pretty backward here but public areas and most middle to upmarket businesses have a nofirearm policy so you only have guns in lowmarket areas or peoples homes
india,not_removed,i think problem is much deeper than trump alone you are correct in saying that racism is a problem that will exist with or without trump but with trump you feel these people feel justified to mistreat brown people as mr trump himself isnt all that great a fan of mexicans muslims etc the problem is that these racists feel similar when they see anyone who is brown skinned they dont bother knowing your ethnicity they want you out of their country no matter how productive you are you are right that the problem goes deeper than that but the lack of concern from trump not so much as a simple tweet is worrying
india,not_removed,thecheetobenito my fucking sides
india,not_removed,how do you like my unesco certified™®™® maymay i think its pretty dank
india,not_removed,at least the blacks are still considered to be humans if you go to some villages the dalits would be killed if they even tried going through a road passing by the upper castes
india,not_removed,of course and it exists there as well
india,not_removed,as for the rapes it is the nature of hooligans to do so what has it got to do with caste women of all castes get raped all over the world why single out a particular caste i really hate such provocative titles like woman of x caste gets raped as if its her caste that caused the crime and not a person humanity above everything else because caste does play a large role in such rapes you have to understand the context behind why those women were raped it symbolises a show of power by the upperclass men showing the lowercastes that they own them by raping their women as for the discrimination its no longer as prominent now as it used to be before barring extremely rural villages of some states its almost nonexistent it certainly doesnt exist in and cities where youll ideally settle if you come here from america bullshit next time see what happens when a domestic help comes to someones house under the guise of hygiene people wont touch her and would offer her tea or biscuit in special plates which are then washed later thats the problem caste discrimination exists so much in our society that we fail to see it
india,not_removed,yes yes those holigans totally not raping you because your husband acted like a normal human being and these hooligans totally not considered respectable role models for others of their caste to follow dont ignore stuff because its easier to make up first order logical explanation
india,not_removed,can you break the remittances country wise i believe most of it comes from middle east rather than us when we talk about nri most just assume those in western countries no love for indians in middle east
india,not_removed,remittances are not donations nris give for the countrygovt
india,not_removed,scientifically and culturally how genuinely asking
india,not_removed,you know what people would rather have solidarity from other people of all countries
india,not_removed,alternate fact the majority of americans are minorities
india,not_removed,of course not thats why i said that independentminded rightists exist you and your family are examples of that in the public i can name shourie or yashwant sinha but are you seriously suggesting that modi doesnt have a giant personality cult around himone which he actively cultivates this is not unique to the right indira had the same kind of cult surrounding her when she was at her peak but right now its happening on the right and its silly to try to deny that anyway this is a tangetial discussion
india,not_removed,ummmm he was supposed to make india great again bringing corrupt congress to book make in india etc etc
india,not_removed,just seems funny to me that no one bats an eyelid if someone is killed in their own backyard but loses their mind over an incident in a faroff country which might not even affect them
india,not_removed,i didnt sticky any thread i am not even a mod you must be mistaken
india,not_removed,atleast he considers them
india,not_removed,you mean anywhere in india designated
india,not_removed,no but have been to d e s i g n a t e d
india,not_removed,bay area i didnt feel unsafe because i was a minority i felt unsafe because i felt unsafe i was also the victim of multiple attempted crimes and one actual crime what part of india are you from
india,not_removed,no he is right i have never had any problems in india in over years there cant say the same about us
india,not_removed,when thing get tough we tends to go back to primitive tribalism thats an fact with automation and social media i think thing will continue to be bad for sometime
india,not_removed,blacks have been killed for trying to sell chewing gum in white areas google i cant breathe black lives matter till blacks could not sit with whites in buses or live in same areas as them martin luther king had to die to make that popssible
india,not_removed,ah so you havent been to any city
india,not_removed,what city have you been to in mumbai i wouldnt know how to differentiate between a dalit and a nondalit and its the same in puneahmedabad and other tier cities
india,not_removed,it symbolises a show of power by the upperclass men showing the lowercastes that they own them by raping their women agreed but that happens all over the world and not just in india but this kind of phenomenon certainly doesnt happen in urban pockets of india especially where you live in the flatapartment system ask your relatives who dwell in such a system and they will tell you bullshit next time see what happens when a domestic help comes to someones house under the guise of hygiene people wont touch her and would offer her tea or biscuit in special plates which are then washed later i stay in pune which is a city in india ive visited lots of places and know many people here but yet to see the kind of people who still have problems with touchability
india,not_removed,i just want to say this indians being in any part of the globe if there is a problem for them indian government must give them support and show that violence against indians will not be tolerated look at how israel deals with violence against israelis anywhere around the globe that is what gives a country its pride we can be a poor country but we must have a backbone and stand up to violence against any indian this goes same to the middle east on how indian labourers and maids are treated in qatar and saudi indian government must not overlook it for better relationship with those host countries no country will respect you if you sell your own people out about breakdown you can find it here httpsenwikipediaorgwikiremittancestoindiaremittancesfromindia
india,not_removed,it is money from an external economy into indian domestic market if we did not have nris remittance and bond buying after us sanctions in the india must have suffered immensely it was indias nri strength that even today we have a voice at the table in the west
india,not_removed,culturally indian movies being shown in japan us uk singapore and malaysia it is small but still significant many foreigners come to india to learn dance or yoga or music after exposure to indian culture in their communities abroad scientifically there are many nris one i know personally who has settled in california hold indian passport and collaborates with indian scientists in a university in tamil nadu on cancer research there are many nris who collaborate in business ventures or help in outsourcing or trading i know this may not be high level things that comes in the news but there is significant uses for india by having nris abroad in various fields
india,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikidemographyoftheunitedstatesraceandethnicity no also many hispanics selfidentify as white if you count them then the us is close to white

india,not_removed,bechara biwi nahin milegi
india,not_removed,uhh the bay area is not part of socal only areas south of kern county are part of socal the bay area is in northern california im originally from delhi
india,not_removed,thats rather shocking you seem to be in denial where in india are you
india,not_removed,and they get called out for it in india dalit discrimination exists as a very fabric of the society so much so that no one even thinks that they are discriminating against them try running a dalit lives matter in india you will be killed by some upper caste within a couple of months
india,not_removed,oh really maybe you should look outside and see who cleans your sewers in the city
india,not_removed,pretty easytraditionally dalits live on the outskirts of villages and share spaces with muslims in ghettoes in cities some of the predominant dalit areas are byculla kurla godandi wadala in mumbai aundh raod slums lohegaon in pune chwalnagar mehul in ahmedabad etc
india,not_removed,agreed but that happens all over the world and not just in india but this kind of phenomenon certainly doesnt happen in urban pockets of india especially where you live in the flatapartment system ask your relatives who dwell in such a system and they will tell you real india doesnt live inside the flatapartment system of cities over of india lives in villages it is a big mistake to look at some small pockets of india and say that since lower castes arent raped there openly caste discrimination is dead i stay in pune which is a city in india ive visited lots of places and know many people here but yet to see the kind of people who still have problems with touchability ask people around i am sure that people avoid touching their domestic helps even accidentally and give them food in different plates
india,not_removed,indian movies being shown in japan us uk singapore and malaysia it is small but still significant many foreigners come to india to learn dance or yoga or music after exposure to indian culture in their communities abroad that has nothing to do with nris people have been coming to india and importing indian entertainment long before immigration was a thing
india,not_removed,sir hispanics arent white theyre the victims of racism too
india,not_removed,reading your comments ont his post i realise you were the kind of indian who did not attend ramanujans funeral because he traveled overseas
india,not_removed,my bad edited delhi is the only place in india ive been to that felt as unsafe as the bay so maybe your perspective is a bit different from mine pune is a ridiculously safe city
india,not_removed,i have lived in tier city with a issue its seems like you are in denial
india,not_removed,bangalore chennai in india pittsburgh atlanta dallas in us
india,not_removed,maywati has regularly criticized brahmins said lot of stuff against upper castes several dmk leaders have talked about throwing upper castes into the sea both have been leaders of their respective states there are hunderds of such leaders in india
india,not_removed,where do you get your knowledge 😂
india,not_removed,see i used to visit kurlawadalabyculla for engineeringhigh school and have never been able to identify anyone as a dalit how do you even tell by looking at someones face that he is a dalit even if you tell me your full name i wouldnt know based on it it depends on your upbringing
india,not_removed,it has everything to do with nris so have people visited africa or middle east or china or japan why is their movies not running to filled theatres why are amir khan and rajnikath movies running in uk and us why are yoga classes carnatic dance and music classes popping up all over the us it is because there is always a nri community to be catered to it spread our culture to so many people across the world nri communities can easily move and teach their kids balet or western music but why are they teaching them in indian cultural art forms because they want to preserve the indian cultural bond for generations you must be willfully blind to ignore that and jump on the hate nri bandwagon
india,not_removed,sir hispanics arent white legally they are considered white same for jews despite both of them being considered distinct races by white supremacists
india,not_removed,nah pune is a exception ive been going to delhi bombay and chennai over the years and its the same story everywhere nobody can trust the police force instead of limited ghettos like in the us crime is rampant across nearly half of the cities at night college campuses are threatened by gundas and kulcha warriors in the us the majority of indians live in middle to upper middle class suburban areas these areas have regular police patrol and almost nullified crime rates compare that to an affluent superb in any major indian city which still have late night crime outside the community gates theres a massive difference in safety between the two countries
india,not_removed,crap didnt see the not
india,not_removed,maywati has regularly criticized brahmins said lot of stuff against upper castes several dmk leaders have talked about throwing upper castes into the sea not talking about politicians backed by goondas powerful people everywhere are safe no white is going to shoot a obama or a lebron james i am talking about ordinary lower caste people blm is a mass movement started by ordinary blacks you wont find an equivalent to that here
india,not_removed,the outside world where i frequent i suggest you do the same instead of being stuck inside that gigantic arsehole
india,not_removed,how do you even tell by looking at someones face that he is a dalit even if you tell me your full name i wouldnt know based on it it depends on your upbringing just because you are not able to do it doesnt mean that everybody cant anyway most of the discrimination against dalits in cities happens invisibly with many people not even realizing it i think i have mentioned this elsewhere here but just check how the domestic help is treated in your home that will itself give you an indication of how dalits are treated in cities
india,not_removed,pakistan consumes more indian entertainment than both us and uk are you going to chalk that up as nri involvement so have people visited africa or middle east or china or japan why is their movies not running to filled theatres dude chinese and japanese movies are more popular than indian movies in both us and uk hell chinese movies are extremely popular in india too remember shaolin soccer that had a full theatrical release complete with a hindi dub and in case you didnt notice middle eastern directors get a lot of attention in western film festivals and oscars your entire argument isnt based on reality
india,not_removed,i doubt the italians and the irish were ever discriminated against for their skin colour the italians ive read about a little and what i have understood is that racism although technically it wasnt racism against the italians had more to do with the perception of them being the fifth column
india,not_removed,legally even dalits in india are to be given the same status as upper castes haha
india,not_removed,ive been to plenty of parts of india mumbai is mostly safe bangalore is even safer than pune calcutta feels safer to many of my friends who live there ahmedabad feels just as safe nagpur is around the same hyderabad is around the same instead of limited ghettos like in the us crime is rampant across nearly half of the cities at night as is crime in american cities in the us the majority of indians live in middle to upper middle class suburban areas which are depressing as fuck cities are full of crime compare that to an affluent superb in any major indian city which still have late night crime outside the community gates i didnt live in an affluent suburb in pune statistically the homicide rate in the us is also higher than it is in india
india,not_removed,ordinary blacks get shot at a rate much higher than dalits in india dalits arent very well represented in bollywood or other cultural aspects of our life as a society we do need to do a better job of talking about casteism
india,not_removed,of course you frequent the outside world you must be so brave cave dwellers like me know nothing 😂
india,not_removed,at my place the domestic help comes once a day eats lunch with my mom after helping her with the cooking gets paid the same for someone who comes twice a day
india,not_removed,pakistan is culturally indian they are trying hard to change that and become culturally arab but they still are culturally indian that is the reason they consume indian movies heavily we have already won that culturally war with pakistan that even their government has to lift bans on indian movies due to popular pressure you are conflating two separate things in your argument nri communities spread indian culture to the west or in communities they live in by consumption and exposure the other being indian cultural aspects spreading through conventional methods like foreign movies or tourism we have small but significant market for indian movies in africa and even afghanistan that is solely because of spread of indian movies slowly through conventional methods but the spread of indian culture food moviesdance and music in the west and other parts of middle east aggressively in the last years is largely because of nri communities in the respective countries today the largest overseas markets for indian movies is the north american market and middle east today if you go to an clasical dance academy in india there as many international students as indians there is a difference between chinese movie markets and indian movie market in isolation india is a volume market that is catered almost exclusively to indian cultural audience chinese movies have a much higher production value and cater to the action genre for the most part if you put a chinese drama movie in the us it will not run but that is not the same for indian movies most of the indian movies that become hits abroad are drama movies consumed almost entirely by nri communities you are mixing up realities and creating your own reality and then saying my argument is not based on the flawed reality you are creating

india,not_removed,as a doctor who have worked with many scientists in various facilities i must say that biomedical research in india is merely copying the west any new idea is laughed upon it take months if not years to get a reagentequipment first a tender is floated that you ll get quotes thn do evaluation and submit report more meetings rate negotiation selection of and its way too much bullshit stay away from research in india in biomedical field
india,not_removed,dont bother doing an mbbs if you want to be a researcher i did a bsc in physics and am now a postdoc in a biomedical field in the us got my nori and successfully remember peoples idea of a subjects scope is very subjective arbitrary or irrelevant to your interests try to understand the kind of job youre hoping to get academic research in a university setting there is plenty of scope in india tifr iiser ncbs iisc ccmbmany more or you could continue working in the us what do your family mean by scope edit in response to your two options i would recommend doing your bsc and msc in india make sure to get some good research experience and then applying for a fully funded phd position in the us
india,not_removed,pay scale for scientist as per cpc in indian research centers unfortunately these centers are decades behind in cutting edge research for career planning i would advice a more flexible approach rather than a fixed and obscure option
india,not_removed,as long as youre working in one of the tifrs iisc ccmb drdo iict rri university of hyderabad university of pune ict mumbai iisers cebs iits etc its worth becoming a scientist in india but as you can see since the options are limited the competition is gonna be quite high so be prepared also start learning math ive seen lots of people from pcb or bipc stream struggle in the first few years of bsc since they had done calculus and advanced trigonometry in high school
india,not_removed,if you want to achieve immortality then you have to learn more about samarsa suddha sanmargam introduced by vallalarhe is immortal but dont confuse this with career bsc in iisc is the best bet first you have to find yourself whether you really enjoy research
india,not_removed,if youre seeking a secure lifelong job perhaps if you just want to do genuine research and achieve something no in india most research is done by government or governmentrun educational and research institutions that have a certain bureaucratic way of operating
india,not_removed,become scientist but make sure you leave india its not worth it to waste time here with uneducated morons who control funds and shit
india,not_removed,not necessarily
india,not_removed,i was talking about ms
india,not_removed,not eligible mathematics is required as main subject in standard
india,not_removed,that is very depressing to hear i once visited csircimap and had the same response from a professor there no funds from the government either anyway thanks for the advice doc
india,not_removed,alma mater if you dont mind me asking
india,not_removed,what do your family mean by scope financial security though for me scope has a different meaning like opportunity then applying for a fully funded phd position in the us can a phd from us guarantee me a job there
india,not_removed,drdo the scope for actual research in drdo is fairly limited you can do a lot of development work though particularly in engineering
india,not_removed,tifrs iisc ccmb drdo iict rri university of hyderabad university of pune ict mumbai iisers cebs iits im not quite confident about their biomedical facilities the competition is gonna be quite high so be prepared ill work harder now also start learning math thanks for the advice i suck at maths just like you predicted
india,not_removed,i second this currently in my final year of ms at iisc the bs program here is too notch op can google about kvpy exam for entry into that program
india,not_removed,you have to learn more about samarsa suddha sanmargam introduced by vallalarhe is immortal but dont confuse this with career hmmm immortal men are also mentioned in autobiography of a yogi but that path is not for me at least and no i havent confused it with career im downright serious about it also can you tell me more about samarsa suddha sanmargam and vallalar bsc in iisc is the best bet not eligible maths first you have to find yourself whether you really enjoy research yes i do
india,not_removed,if you just want to do genuine research and achieve something no ive made my decision now thanks to you guys
india,not_removed,lol that was harsh
india,not_removed,can u give some examples to gauge the caliber you are talking about
india,not_removed,normally not always if youre paying for your phd youre doing something wrong
india,not_removed,a phd can almost definitely guarantee a job as a nonimmigrant its trickier because you would need your employer to sponsor your visa the most straightforward way to do this is to do a postdoc universities dont have a cap on and visas and you should be able to find a lab that would hire you as a postdoc during this time you could apply for a green card after getting a nori and waiver if applicable
india,not_removed,hence the question mark
india,not_removed,as far as i know ccmb tifr university of hyderabad and some of the iisers have really good biochemistry facilities but if you want a job in biomedical research then consider applying for a job in the rd department of indian immunological ltd hyderabad dr reddy labs bayer corp novartis corporation etc as far as i know not much original research goes on here its mostly reverse engineering drugs whose patent has expired
india,not_removed,currently in my final year of ms at iisc the bs program here is too notch im jealous op can google about kvpy exam for entry into that program will surely do
india,not_removed,bhai i am a scientist so was my dad and few other family members its simply not worth it to waste you time and youth here its a fucking cesspool in here
india,not_removed,although i agree with you but trends say otherwise a lot of people are paying for their ms andor phd abroad more so for the vision of citizenship rather than education increasingly people are going for all sorts of courses fot the same phd is one of the easiest way to gain citizenship as one scores a lot of points in the pr through the same besides regarding how unequal the selection process is a lot of people have to option of either spending in india or spend more even if its more go abroadget jobs there and recover a part of that cost as well as option to settle all of these perks are better than ending up jobless after indian education at those costs youd be surprised the price people are willing to pay to leave the country and stay out this benefits nations as it greatly brings influx of money into their economies as some notions go nations like australia have pushed away their impending recession by opening their shores to such immigrants how effective this iswill be i have no idea edit whats with the downvotes
india,not_removed,cool
india,not_removed,ill remember this advice good sir
india,not_removed,sometimes i wish i can do something for this country but here i am planning to abandon the ship anyway i do agree with you and the recent events truly reflect that
india,not_removed,ms and phd are very different things can you point to a phd program from a reputable university that requires the student to pay
india,not_removed,a lot of people are paying for their ms andor phd abroad youre saying ms andor phd like theyre similar but theyre honestly not im really sceptical about the existence of reputed universities that require you to pay for a phd
india,not_removed,eh no one pays for their phd maybe if you are doing it in a shit field like gender studies
india,not_removed,downvotes are probably for the claim that people are paying for their phds
india,not_removed,check my other reply if you have the qualifications as in publications etc then try applying anywhere reputable or not if they feel you will not be able to qualify the scholarship roundsthen its intended if you can pay the fees and survive on your own money or your own sources or other scholarships that are available for international students if you tell them you wont be able to join without a scholarship then they are not likely to go ahead with your application otoh if you tell them you can pay for it like the chineese whose own countries funding or other sources will help them with the feesfunding then theyll consider taking you iff you qualify by skill if there are skilled phd students required but only scholarships in their institute and other externalthe other if any can arrange for their scholarshipthen there is a good chance you can still get in source myself i have research credentials of around years and by experience i had qualified for phd i have over publications including first author but because my mtech marks were less about for scholarship i was asked if i could fund myself ofcourse i could not so my application was not taken forward this was at one of the top universities in the developed world
india,not_removed,for phd there are two qualifications one by publicationsmerit secondly the more competitive one for scholarshipfunding its not like in india where you get your funding first through projects or own funding csirdbtdsticmr fellowships and then you join for phd countries like china hence willing fund their citizens for phds abroad under the condition that they come back and work for years atleast in china
india,not_removed,again ive not seen this at all literally every phd position ive ever come across or considered comes with funding
india,not_removed,there are always two types generally when the pi has funds to choose his own candidate ie funds for manpower and he does not both cases are equally valid for a skilled individual to apply for phd

india,not_removed,gharwapsi
india,not_removed,does salary also not depend on where you will be located someone paying when you are in california or ny makes sense but if your job is in texas then nobody is going to pay you
india,not_removed,just as a refresher heres the list of companies for latest data available notice how few workers googleamazonapple uses even a wall street bank like jp morgan uses more visas than apple an accounting firm like ernst young issues roughly the same amount of visas as apple amazon put together infosys issues more visas than the top us tech companies combined if you dont see whats wrong here then you are beyond help
india,not_removed,its bad for indian it industry and very good for students it also removes country caps and this bill has only been introduced not passed
india,not_removed,tbh it does make sense purpose of was to get skills which are not available in us and not to bring cheaper substitute
india,not_removed,the chances of a straightoutofms graduate getting and above straight out of college without workex is terribly lowmaybe who get into njny area from ivy league schools this is going to badly affect the number of indians going for ms schools like university of north kentucky u of south dakota will be losing buttloads of money leave alone the decent ones my guess is they will lobby down the package down to and above
india,not_removed,likely consequences it outsourcing company stocks will take a hit in the short term significant number of holders will return to their home countries as employers might not able to justify doubling their salaries for the work they get done right now many europeans who currently cannot get into us through will benefit as the flooding from indian it companies will stop in the long run silicon valley will benefit but will be hit in the short term likely improvement in the quality of indian engineers as there are less chances of getting lucky with the visa
india,not_removed,trump government tables new bill techies it firms brace for tough future washington a legislation has been introduced in the us house of representatives which among other things calls for more than doubling the minimum salary of visa holders to usd making it difficult for firms to use the programme to replace american employees with foreign workers including from india the highskilled integrity and fairness act of introduced by california congressman zoe lofgren prioritises market based allocation of visas to those companies willing to pay per cent of a wage calculated by survey eliminates the category of lowest pay and raises the salary level at which dependent employer are exempt from non displacement and recruitment attestation requirements to greater than usd this is more than double of the current minimum wage of usd which was established in and since then has remained unchanged my legislation refocuses the programme to its original intent to seek out and find the best and brightest from around the world and to supplement the us workforce with talented highlypaid and highlyskilled workers who help create jobs here in america not replace them said lofgren it offers a marketbased solution that gives priority to those companies willing to pay the most this ensures american employers have access to the talent they need while removing incentives for companies to undercut american wages and outsource jobs he said lofgren said it removes the per country cap for employment based immigrant visas so that all workers are treated more fairly and to move to a system where employers hire the most skilled workers without regard to national origin it raises the salary level at which dependent employer are exempt from attestation requirements to a new required wage level of percentile points above the median national annual wage for computer and mathematical occupations published by the department of labour occupational employment statistics roughly which would be adjusted in the future without the need for new legislation and eliminates the masters degree exemption for dependent employers the legislation sets aside per cent of the annually allocated visas for small and startup employers or fewer employers to ensure small businesses have an opportunity to compete for highskilled workers while still protecting against outsourcing it among other things removes visa hurdles for students and other temporary visa holders by building a bridge from student status to lawful permanent residence and removes paperwork burdens by streamlining filing requirements and reducing administrative costs the legislation tightens employee protection by stipulating that employers may not reduce beneficiary wages regardless of whether the deduction is in accordance with a voluntary authorisation by the employee it makes exceptions for taxes garnishments and deductions that are reasonable and customary in the occupation in related development senator sherrod brown has announced to introduce and visa reform act in the senate which he said would close loopholes in the and visa programs and provide increased protections for both american workers and visa holders we need to crack down on the fraud and abuse that allows corporations to avoid paying americans fair wages and exploit foreign workers said brown during his campaign president trump promised to increase oversight of our and visa programs and reform starts with this bipartisan legislation to ensure that american businesses are giving american workers a fair shot at goodpaying jobs he said the bill would require that employers first offer a vacant position to an equally or better qualified american worker before seeking an or visa holder it would also establish wage requirements for workers and improve wage requirements to encourage companies to hire qualified american workers and prevent them from using foreign workers as a source of cheap labour under the and visa reform the department of labor dol and the department of homeland security dhs would have additional oversight authority to investigate fraud and abuse as well as to increase penalties for companies that violate the bills requirements the bill also requires dol and dhs to share information so that visa petitions are effectively scrutinised version function i post the articles text as a comment if the website is adblocker unfriendly rendered by prometheus
india,not_removed,pehle demonetization then this ab ke ghar kaun khareedega
india,not_removed,are stocksbonuses included in that yearly salary or is it just base salary
india,not_removed,will it in any way affect the nonit indian workers students in the us or planning to go there
india,not_removed,all this talk about techies are people forgetting that there are non cssilicon valley indian workers too and that nonsv salaries do not even start at the mark
india,not_removed,this means most of the randians wont get to us
india,not_removed,in theory i agree with the changes but this is a blatant hypocrisy on american side they will sue the shit out of our solar manufacturing industry if it has competitive prices but wont allow our companies to do the same in their market emerging nations are bullied by developed nations for a long time and the saga goes on
india,not_removed,not the first time such a bill is being introduced will be defeated most likely nasscom is a pro in lobbying
india,not_removed,can someone explain how a bill is passed in the us in this instance the bill has been introduced by zoe lofgren httpsenwikipediaorgwikizoelofgren and is opposing trump on a number of issues how do we know that the trump government supports this bill and will allow it to pass
india,not_removed, eliminates the per country cap for employmentbased immigrant visas so that all workers are treated fairly isnt this a good thing for all indians waiting in queue for green card
india,not_removed,does this eliminate the masters quota or do masters students also have to meet the salary floor
india,not_removed,removal of percountry cap is good for highly qualified indians who havenudied in us
india,not_removed,i would encourage all us residents over here to join the group httpsimmigrationvoiceorg they are working effectively to find solutions to the highskilled green card backlogs that is fundamentally the reason why indians and chinese are getting exploited in the states by the indian and american outsourcing companies i might add they are the main reason for being introduced in the house and are looking for people to do advocacy at the local level
india,not_removed,just a bill still has to be passed expect repercussions soon companies chiefs will start shouting soon enough
india,not_removed,the median salary for developers and engineers is reported to be around and per year respectively per year will be a huge cost increase to many companies
india,not_removed,i do not think our it companies will be affected the bill suggests raising the floor to for dependent companiesdependent definition which is to mean any company which employs over people and has over of its staff working in the us on a visa
india,not_removed,okay lets calm the fuck down its only been introduced bills typically take a long time to get through both houses of congress and are usually killed in one of them there are already other bills introduced that set different limits lets wait and see what happens but its too early to call it
india,not_removed,i suspect this will face far less opposition in the us than trumps proposed measures to limit and deport illegal immigrants from mexico because upper and middle class american voters feel threatened by educated indian visa holders but not by illiterate mexican illegals who do the jobs americans wont do
india,not_removed,will this have any impact on the freelanceremote working market
india,not_removed,this was introduced few days back indian media picked it up today to make a big splash plus this is proposed by a democrat so not sure how much of it will be approved we are yet to see executive order from trump regarding
india,not_removed,europeans who currently cannot get into us through will benefit as the flooding from indian it companies will stop fuckthose poor poor europeans who were blocked till now because of indian corrupt practices by it companiesnow more the reason i support the move first american president who did an amazing surgical strikei support the moveso what if i didnt support the move of demothis is great
india,not_removed,seems like mr inchs phone call went well with his buddy
india,not_removed,does anyone know if this affects renewals if so it impacts people who are presently here on an
india,not_removed,i am a bit sad but some what happy i am in a dilemma to go or not it will give a clear solutioni will sit and decide whether i had enough skill set to clearly get a job after ms and do i really need to go or work hard and rise through the ranks in india
india,not_removed,how does this apply to those that already have visas
india,not_removed,i dont think this is a permanent turn of eventshe is taking action to placate his voter base
india,not_removed,whats the source of the number income across the us cannot be generalized this way
india,not_removed,does it affect nonprofit
india,not_removed,one of the provisions is to remove countryspecific limits for employment based immigrant visas that would be great news to of indiaborn applicants with approved waiting for their green cards
india,not_removed,taken from newsycombinator comment here is the summary straight from the horses mouth httpslofgrenhousegovuploadedfileshighskilledbillsx a few points this does not raise the salary requirement to this only applies to employers that do not want to do the extra paper work for attestations regarding recruitment and nondisplacement of us workers it takes a market based allocation strategy which allows cash bonuses and similar compensation to be included this is a joke startups and small businesses will get of the visas itll be interesting to see how this is gamed this does not fix the corporatehigher ed partnership loophole this does not fix the power imbalance between visa holders and employers i personally dont see this bill going anywhere zoe just needs to look like she is doing something
india,not_removed,what happens to noncs majors from us universities that cant find work in silicon valley
india,not_removed,as a prospective masters student for fall how fucked am i
india,not_removed,this bill may not pass so dont get wet yet for starters this bill was introduced by a democrat which means it is highly unlikely to be approved similar bills were introduced earlier too with base pay which did not go through the republican controlled congresseven though that bill was introduced by republicans the bill also states that companies which are dependent have to pay those salaries there are many companies here which are not dependent of their employees are on esp if you working on the client side k base salary is arbitrarynote it does not include bonus so ppl who have big bonuses and incentives in their contracts wont make the cut even though their total pay crosses the cutoff i get it but a lot of them dont and depending on the place the salary varies hugely i have worked with many small companies before and most of them cannot pay these ridiculous wages and a lot of the work they do cannot be outsourced as well putting a cutoff salary means many small companies have serious disruptions in their operations this is capitalist country and the last thing they will do is stifle businesses yes they will protect american jobs and that is by making companies not hire to replace americans which is fair enough if there are talented americans then a lot of the positions will be filled by them what they want to stop though is abuse like what happened with disney where they replaced americans with a law addressing that is fair enough and a lot of people with agree with that
india,not_removed,long time coming the good days of desi body shops abusing the visa system are going to wind up now they may do massive and applications and they have already done this and hire local desis
india,not_removed,to everyone jumping the bandwagon have you guys actually read the bill if youre paying youre considered exempt you can still pay whatever you want you will just have to go through additional paperwork to prove that you couldnt find a qualified american plus you can show bonuses perks etc as a part of the package we all know how these things will work out
india,not_removed,the bill raises the salary level at which dependent employer are exempt from non displacement to greater than washington a legislation has been introduced in the us house of representatives which among other things calls for more than doubling the minimum salary of visa holders to usd making it difficult for firms to use the programme to replace american employees with foreign workers including from indiathe highskilled integrity and fairness act of introduced by california congressman zoe lofgren prioritises market based allocation of visas to those companies willing to pay per cent of a wage calculated by survey eliminates the category of lowest pay and raises the salary level at which dependent employer are exempt from non displacement and recruitment attestation requirements to greater than usd is more than double of the current minimum wage of usd which was established in and since then has remained unchanged my legislation refocuses the programme to its original intent to seek out and find the best and brightest from around the world and to supplement the us workforce with talented highlypaid and highlyskilled workers who help create jobs here in america not replace them said lofgren it offers a marketbased solution that gives priority to those companies willing to pay the most this ensures american employers have access to the talent they need while removing incentives for companies to undercut american wages and outsource jobs he saidlofgren said it removes the per country cap for employment based immigrant visas so that all workers are treated more fairly and to move to a system where employers hire the most skilled workers without regard to national originit raises the salary level at which dependent employer are exempt from attestation requirements to a new required wage level of percentile points above the median national annual wage for computer and mathematical occupations published by the department of labour occupational employment statistics roughly which would be adjusted in the future without the need for new legislation and eliminates the masters degree exemption for dependent employersthe legislation sets aside per cent of the annually allocated visas for small and startup employers or fewer employers to ensure small businesses have an opportunity to compete for highskilled workers while still protecting against outsourcingit among other things removes visa hurdles for students and other temporary visa holders by building a bridge from student status to lawful permanent residence and removes paperwork burdens by streamlining filing requirements and reducing administrative coststhe legislation tightens employee protection by stipulating that employers may not reduce beneficiary wages regardless of whether the deduction is in accordance with a voluntary authorisation by the employee here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme

india,not_removed,you can make easily in the silicon valley even if youre at a starter position the cost of living there is just that high its places like delaware and nj that would be hit bad because even manager level employees are paid like in those states
india,not_removed,my friend times have changed have you even been austin recently
india,not_removed,yes salary requirement will be based on your location preciously the msa of the job location the formula to calculate the prevailing wage is changed and number of tiers have been reduced from to what we are reading in the news is applicable for silicon valley area read from dol from where the figure of has been picked up salaries are always linked to wages declared by dol this will slightly improve the situation for everyone of us i dont think experienced people are getting impacted unless they are really exploited by their sponsors above page has the where figure of which is begin referenced everywhere precise salary is salient feature of highskilled integrity and fairness act of eliminates the per country cap for employmentbased immigrant visas raises the per country cap from to for familysponsored immigrant visas the new dependent employer wage exemption level will be set at percentile points above the median for the most recent national annual wage dependent employers are those with more than of their workforce in status unless dependent employers compensate their workers above the required wage level they must make attestations regarding recruitment and nondisplacement of us workers eliminates the masters degree exemption for dependent employers dol wage determination which is level current ys replaced by a much higher requirement and only levels new will be based on salary no more lottery of will be for startups employees no amendment to be filed for change of work location
india,not_removed,in infosys tcs the and in the table but the truth cant be hidden for long some infosys tcs wipro guys were even caught for some shady dealings related to visa fraud few years back however wonder if the bill will get passed what with all their lobbying powers only time will tell
india,not_removed,that data is contaminated apple has outsourced some of its projects to infy so quite a few people working in apple are on but via infytcswipro so that changes things a little bit
india,not_removed,you are not considering supply and demand are you saying wiproinfy has more musclemoney power to have more visas than googleamazon etc then you are mistaken its just that googleamazon etc are product companies they dont need of people tcsinfy do need as they are people based more people more revenue
india,not_removed,what is surprising is that apple is the only firm in the top where the average salary meets the norm required in the bill even the top tech companies seem to be using the process to hire people on low salaries
india,not_removed,whole your data is correct it hides a lot of inside stuff the reason why infytcs file so many green cards is because applemicrosoft etc require that many people infosys has a big account at apple and tcs at microsoft thats the reason most of these companies you mentioned dont file many because they get tcsinfy to do it for them
india,not_removed,is india not sending its best
india,not_removed,very good for students how it is good for students
india,not_removed,if you see its actually bad for students if you arent in the top of the top the companies who will be paying you will not even hire you stating that you arent good enough its either pay more for less quality or hire folks who are worth
india,not_removed,you guys have to be crazy to believe what you are saying have you hired for a engineering position in america you dont get any american resumes most resumes will be from immigrants especially chinese or indians its impossible to hire only americans this bill is equivalent to trumps position on manufacturing and coal jobs its not going to work off shoring is going to increase even more its actually good news for indian it industry
india,not_removed,there is no argument limit is probably best i am surprised previous govt didnt have balls to do it
india,not_removed,apparently the old requirement hasnt been updated since iirc its not even inflation indexed this increase was a long time coming though i agree they might reduce it a bit due to pressure from employers however to further exacerbate matters this bill has been tabled by a democrat
india,not_removed,you skipped a major oneit will severely impact the number of students going to study in the usa opt gives you visa free work for sometime but chances of them getting work post that becomes null since the salary required is way too high edit i also disagree with point silicon valley will take a hit they would be required to pay way more for the same talent or hire from the domestic pool which is small and not at par when compared with the international pool also lets them keep their onroll employee cost low by hiring cheap workers and allocate a hire budget to innovation with this scheme gone they will be spending more on their employees
india,not_removed,sounds reasonable to me the visa system has been broken for a long time it was designed for outside experts but it has been transformed into a shortcut to quick profits for us companies and a way to get a green card for indian citizens these changes would rectify that and make the system work as intended at the outset
india,not_removed,what you missed out is that even more jobs will be shipped to india philippines vietnam and the likes while it is true that it services companies benefit immensely from the program it is also true that usa doesnt produce as many citizens who are stem graduates as the industries here need while it is certainly disadvantageous to it services companies americans will be even more affected because holders participate in the economy and pay taxes without actually having any representation when these jobs get shipped offshore none of that happens and the american economy stands to lose
india,not_removed,leads to impact on real estate here
india,not_removed,does this affect existing visa holders also ie those who are on a but earn less than
india,not_removed,there will also be significant effort in making local cost centers much better than what they are today to be honest india still is a good destination for most of technical companies people who will be impacted will be delivery and product management who typically are middle management who manage folks in india from onsite
india,not_removed,elaborate point and please
india,not_removed,will us companies invest more in offshore centers or may be not deeming that trump may be here only for years
india,not_removed,likely consequences it outsourcing company stocks will take a hit in the short term can you please define short term and long term for this obviously it will be assumptions
india,not_removed,it depends a lot on your location in west cost you might be safe with limit but anywhere else you are in danger specifically the new graduatesno one pays for new graduates unless they have phd or some really necessarily expertise that is required by companys located outside sv and seattle the education industry will take a big hit very few will come for their masters or phd i dont understand how he europeans will benefit coz even for them the limit will apply i also dont believe it will be good for sv or tech companies in the long run unless you consider years as a long run because a lot of positions will be available without anyone to fill them
india,not_removed,students free trade visas this is a great move tbh
india,not_removed,what is dual intent
india,not_removed,shed some more light on itif you make less than that youll be let go
india,not_removed,hopefully us in sale wala prices yrs from now when the khandars will still be unsold
india,not_removed,nondiscretionary bonususually expected deductibles can be included also this requirement is only for companies which are dependentie have finally keep in mind this is just a bill as of now it probably wont be passed especially when a number like doesnt make any sense for small citiestowns
india,not_removed,base
india,not_removed,it affects everyone on it nonit doesnt matter
india,not_removed,yes it does because the field you got your degree in does not matter everybody needs a visa to work in the us
india,not_removed,lelno one gives a shit abt them
india,not_removed,and no more is l enough to survive posts
india,not_removed,well said perhaps we should start boycotting pepsi coke gm ford mcd etc and stop sending them our money also forex
india,not_removed,are you aware of the fact that we are dealing with a guy who fired the attorney general within couple of hours because she refused to defend the ban on certain nationals entering the united states
india,not_removed,any history of nasscom getting its way in past legislations
india,not_removed,isnt it a republican majority house right now
india,not_removed,nasscom is a pro in lobbying you are dealing with generations family of lobbyinghe understands better than that to make a decision that wont affect it even through newbie nasscom
india,not_removed,but this time it will be different because the house is controlled by republicans even though the bill is drafted and introduced by a democrat lofgren republicans are in very strong support of this bill this time and they have the majority needed to pass it through
india,not_removed,this
india,not_removed,this seems to be a bipartisan issue it will pass both houses of congress trump will not veto the bill because of his hire american buy american policy
india,not_removed,unki chaandi ho gayi
india,not_removed,it eliminates country based quota and master students will have to qualify
india,not_removed,deleted
india,not_removed,but trump did ban citizens of those countries that looked like a chunavi jumla but wasnt this bill isnt by trump and has been introduced earlier in a different format as well but i would guess likelihood of its passage is higher this time
india,not_removed,of course it will be passedalbeit will be a bit tweaked to give them some relief
india,not_removed,all major indian it companies employ for more than of their us workforce
india,not_removed,how long do bills take in general or does that question not make sense
india,not_removed,i think this should have a positive impact on that fingers are crossed
india,not_removed,no direct impact as law doesnt apply to remotefreelance however number of remote workers could increase as its harder to get
india,not_removed,what do you work on
india,not_removed,is there an exec order regarding in the works as well
india,not_removed,why modi needs to do anything here his job is make this country better so that people prefer to stay rather than migrate
india,not_removed,it was introduced by congresswoman zoe lofgren who is a democrat from california modis call with trump had nothing to do with it
india,not_removed,nasscom etc will want to lodge a protest at the highest level probably will meet his match interesting
india,not_removed,please dont compare glorious trump with an illiterate maggot called modihe is no obamatrump would smell bullshit even from miles as he would enter
india,not_removed,is your visa in renewal extension at present just curious as mine is
india,not_removed,even smaller ones generally to pay an hour which amounts to in total youre talking about silicon valley salaries right
india,not_removed,ghar wapsi s
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,and what will they do here where are the employment opportunities in india they would have families to feed and liabilities to be met
india,not_removed,deleted
india,not_removed,entire cali is super expensive silicon valley is just posh
india,not_removed,sv isnt the only expensive part of california or the only place with tech industry jobs just the biggest
india,not_removed,that is exactly what i said
india,not_removed,is nj that cheap
india,not_removed,what does that mean you can buy a house in austin for while the same in the bay area would cost you upwards of in south bay sf city is another half million give or take rent in austin is around for and for south bay and for sf city dont come and compare austin with california cities
india,not_removed,microsoft has a ton of people from infy as well
india,not_removed,c thats the fucking point isnt ityou see people are really skilled and filling roles in short supply are the ones directly hired by all tech companies app amzn goog orcl qcom as you can see in list guess what the people hired by infy tcs etc it companies on are doing low skill testingbasic development work these are not highskilled positions these are there just to get cheap labor
india,not_removed,wipro and infy are just glorified body shops that pay peanuts to desis who are excited before flying because they do an instant mental dollar conversion when they get a salary of to
india,not_removed,wipro and infy can get away paying to indians because indians wont complain theyll be too happy to stay in america theyll shack up with flatmates spend minimally and send the rest back home you can see why someone who wants to live in america an american citizen cant make it work with the same salary
india,not_removed,its maybe because apple is largely based in sv where salaries are high to compensate for the cost of living amazon and msft for example are based in seattle where salaries are lower
india,not_removed,for many of the top tech companies equity is a large part of compensation can be or more
india,not_removed,its good for good students
india,not_removed,its good for mastersmba or more specialised students undergrads are fucked
india,not_removed,people who study there do have a good chance of getting better salaries now you ask how employees from infytcswipro are directly sourced while master students actually clear the tests and interviews to get into the company so it might end up benefiting the students
india,not_removed,thats true hadnt thought about it so its a mixed bag for students if youre adding more than to the companys bottomline youre staying otherwise go back that will severely reduce the number of people going to us for studies
india,not_removed,the bill also paves a way from to pr circumventing the it makes dual intent this is not covered in these articles
india,not_removed,the rule only applies to companies where of their workforce are employees so not necessarily
india,not_removed,ave you hired for a engineering position in america you dont get any american resumes ok then hire who is preventing you if a company really needs a resource so bad that it cant find anyone in the us and is ready to even bring them from overseas then they wouldnt mind paying a small premium anyway any company worth its salt the salary expenses are pennies on the dollar when compared to their revenues
india,not_removed,bullshit
india,not_removed,actually i did just hire someone we got extensive resumes and ended up hiring someone on an ead visa the reason they were cheap it wasnt my decision it was management
india,not_removed,and supported by senior democrats in the senate like sherrod brown if anything id expect the republicans to lobby down the threshold income because they are even more bought by corporate interests than the demsalthough it is a close race
india,not_removed,woah so no way that number comes down does itits already quite conservative
india,not_removed,but the wage in the us has remained static there is no inflation i get zero interest on my savings account
india,not_removed,not if i remember the old thread
india,not_removed,opt gives you visa free work for sometime but chances of them getting work post that becomes null since the salary required is way too high i disagree most top tech companies easily pay more than this unless this means base salary higher than i would say most people are safe i got in after student and was earning roughly base target bonus stocks a year
india,not_removed,it will severely impact the number of students going to study in the usa opt gives you visa free work for sometime but chances of them getting work post that becomes null since the salary required is way too high what about the people already in us my friend will be graduating fall this year are chances of him getting an opt difficult due to this
india,not_removed,it will severely impact the number of students going to study in the usa real world works differently
india,not_removed,domestic pool which is small and not at par when compared with the international pool small may be but not at par is bs like in any sample population the bell curve applies and ive seen people ranging from rank idiots to near geniuses in both international and domestic demographic samples
india,not_removed,yup in short good for them bad for us
india,not_removed,this trumpjee wont stop companies from seeking costeffective labour to get work done hell only accelerate the flight of jobs from the us in the long run a reduction in americas competitiveness is good for india china and basically a bunch of countries in the asiapacific region
india,not_removed,probably not as most indians outside would have already made an investment in real estate
india,not_removed,yes but only when your extension is filed as the lawyers will be unable to justify the position as per new visa rules
india,not_removed,lot of mediocre people have moved to the us on especially from india and china naturally more talented people all over the world will get a fair chance at immigration which isnt the case now due to the sheer number of applications indian firms push through most people in india have this dream of getting an engineering degree and moving abroad nothing wrong with that probably theyve seen their not so talented friends move abroad when it becomes clear that only talent is rewarded not luck then they might move on to the fields they are really interested in instead of chasing the american dream
india,not_removed,thats why he said short term moving operations takes a long time longer term it is bound to happen again the plan is to tax companies moving jobs outside us not sure how companies will react to that
india,not_removed,lag gaye lavde xd
india,not_removed,stocks and bonus included dude read the bill itself nondiscretionary bonuses and similar compensation may be applied to wages based on their fair market value at the time of filing anyway it wudnt make sense to not include stocks companies will just pay higher base and not pay stock
india,not_removed,yeah i understand that but what i meant was that do people in non it fields get above easily
india,not_removed,what i meant was is a reasonable figure for an it worker in silicon valley but for someone not in it it will be difficult to get that much
india,not_removed,lpm now
india,not_removed,that means more d a i l y s a x threads
india,not_removed,deleted
india,not_removed,if onlytrump can bring globalization to a screeching halt if he wants
india,not_removed,tbf ag is literally supposed to be like personal lawyer of prez she literally did not do her job even if she personally disagrees
india,not_removed,yeah id be interested in a specific historical example as well
india,not_removed,what qualification
india,not_removed,there used to be a country based quota are you talking about the quota
india,not_removed,countrybased quota isnt that for gc
india,not_removed,because this reform is widely said to be a great benefit to us by limiting to truly skilled labour and not just to it firms its advertised that highly specialised foreign jobs seekers can still benefit from it and make a great contribution to the states but it genuinely ignores the fact that the majority of the specialist jobs in engineering apart from the ones found in tech industries dont pay more than to thus people like me are totally screwed despite studying very advanced degrees
india,not_removed,i am not sure dude the banned countries were countries us has no trade with by the time bill gets passed if it gets passed i would say the income floor would be at
india,not_removed,however number of remote workers could increase as its harder to get quota is unchanged tho
india,not_removed,im a freelance web developer still quite new though around months in the business
india,not_removed,yes there is a leaked draft floating around the web
india,not_removed,yes there is most likely gonna be made public this week
india,not_removed,brain gain but where will you employ all these qualified people do we even have capacity for that imagine working on a arvr tech while being in india all the action is happening in us
india,not_removed,why modi needs to do anything here
india,not_removed,deleted
india,not_removed,trumped
india,not_removed,why should modi give a shit about this move raising the cap is justified and an internal matter why should indians be given special privileges it firms have been pretty blatant about exploiting the program and this move was pretty much expected overloading the lottery system wasnt a sustainable longterm solution
india,not_removed,got it thanks
india,not_removed,no i am an american of indian origin but i have friends who are on
india,not_removed,yeah they ll be forced to work as it coolies i guess if only india had a diverse set of industries we could really use this opportunity to our advantage
india,not_removed,donald of house trump and white with his puny hands and the mighty reform sword killed the indian it sector while screaming his house words grab em by the pussy
india,not_removed,not to mention that their coming back will increase competition here
india,not_removed,the deserving talented folk will always be employed be it america or india
india,not_removed,brutal but true
india,not_removed,come on dude she was a
india,not_removed,agree
india,not_removed,yes i reread it i just got too excited upon hearing this newsnot in a good way
india,not_removed,nj is miniindia in every sense
india,not_removed,nj is horrible crime poverty no good cities bad public transport bad highways im not sure but hdi wise it could be comparable to a thirdworld country
india,not_removed,and what stuff do they do remember that was designed for experts look at the average salary of apple or microsoft and compare it to infosys whoever they are hiring through parties arent exactly designing the next apple soc or the core features of the next windows version or theyd be paid as such or are you telling me that infy are sitting on people who can rival the best of the best of svseattle at a fraction of the cost lets stop this charade the system as it stands today is not working as intended the people being hired arent topnotch outside experts for the most part period
india,not_removed,it does do you have a source for this
india,not_removed,guess what the people hired by infy tcs etc it companies on are doing low skill testingbasic development work these are not highskilled positions these are there just to get cheap labor not entirely true i know of few people who are working in apple offices infy employees who are doing productive work not drudge work but not cutting edge as well im unsure as to which field they are filed under apple or infy
india,not_removed,buddy have you seen indians in airports motels they barely make but they live a life having better infra services lifestyle water and air so though from your perspective these are body shops i know so many people who are living in it and outside it living a much better respectable life than a job in india can offer
india,not_removed,there is no state income tax for seattle employees washington state doesnt levy any income tax that also is a reason for lower salaries in seattle
india,not_removed,no high billl cap mean companies will prefer us workers over immigrant
india,not_removed,to be honest thats what us wants they dont want non specialized students i mean whether its a good thing or bad is a different question
india,not_removed,doesnt it also mean students who dont get a job offer can be sent home or are there separate rules for them
india,not_removed,deleted
india,not_removed,yay i know a filthy rich brat who was a sucker in school but got into university of wisconsin madison computer science as an undergrad fucked he is now marxist boner intensifies
india,not_removed,people who study here always had better salary compared to people from india from companies like infy wipro
india,not_removed,no one is going to pay for student may be only to exceptional students offshore get of work will increase even further
india,not_removed,exactly this bill says you cannot discriminate against students because of their intention to immigrate maybe it will change the motive behind the visa interviews
india,not_removed,can you explain a bit more about what dual intent means
india,not_removed,i am not sure where you are from but in my opinion here in detroit we got american resume for every indo chinese resumes hiring for software positions
india,not_removed,deleted
india,not_removed,not true only some cs grads earn that much in tech companies when it comes to mechanical aero and electrical many are gloomed even very best firms like gd boeing rarely pay more than especially in the east coast also you may know how hard it is to join a defence contractor straight out of college
india,not_removed,depends on whether you were an mba or ms student a lot of grads dont get into west coast tech firms also west coast tech firms dont usually pay these salaries also this is probably base salary as your performance linked bonus and future stock vests are not counted as salary in your filings source west coast tech firm employee in nontech role but hire a lot of tech staff
india,not_removed,ya most of the students dont end up in top tech companies on a side note is pretty impressive i started with a big in ne and was making about including bonus and the whole shabang
india,not_removed,getting the opt should make no difference there might be however lesser number of companies willing to hire him since they know he would be an expensive employee to keep later on
india,not_removed,getting an opt shouldnt be an issue atleast as of now its the getting a job after a year or that is the problem also just something to note companies could become apprehensive about offering jobs to people on an opt as well
india,not_removed,meaning
india,not_removed,youre forgetting that indianinternational students who end up in us are already the smarter ones out from their group the smarter ones in the indian classrooms go to usa there are kids with rich parents but vast majority of indians would be academically inclined ones
india,not_removed,he is actually coming through on his promises and it hasnt even been weeks its impressive tbh
india,not_removed,its almost like people are shocked that a candidate who ran on america first is implementing the program he got elected on who could have guessed
india,not_removed,in the long run a reduction in americas competitiveness is good for india for a country that has not produced one original product in the years of its rotten existence that is a little rich
india,not_removed,which is now worth shit because of demo dear leader is going to get even less supporters in this sub supporters will soon become endangered species
india,not_removed,thanks
india,not_removed,not sure how companies will react to that the nations that are going to receive these jobs can offer temporary tax relief to make the effect of the tax a net zero and attract these new companies alternatively instead of moving operations individuals associated with the corporations can just start up entirely new businesses in india and elsewhere to take on the operations that were going to be moved
india,not_removed,so if also becomes a dual intent visa then students who are working under opt with visa status are eligible to apply for employment based greencard right they dont have to apply for another dual intent visa which was the case before
india,not_removed,its being tabled by a democrat
india,not_removed,how does it affect anyone
india,not_removed,it doesnt nondiscretionary income is included at curr mkt price ie rsus at the time of vesting
india,not_removed,no
india,not_removed,even people in it dont get easily
india,not_removed,depends
india,not_removed,no its not is higher than average
india,not_removed,should be glad that someone stood up to the guy she definitely did her job which is uphold the law and not give into juvenile tantrums
india,not_removed,personal lawyer of us government
india,not_removed,she stood by the law and the constitution of the us which collides with trumps views she was fired because she didnt agree with trump over an unconstitutional opinion
india,not_removed,i am an nri in canada and i am a senior it professional i will be dancing and will lobby the canadian government to do the same note visa abuse is not limited to us
india,not_removed,qualify was the wrong word here students will have to get in order to qualify for
india,not_removed,yes
india,not_removed,gc
india,not_removed,what he meant was how are you a beneficiary when you are actually getting screwed
india,not_removed,yeah but theyre doubling minimum salary it will obviously drive more to remote work
india,not_removed,how are you doing freelancing on that is illegal i think
india,not_removed,lauda gain these suckas are not the real brain brain drain refers to the genius nerds working as scientist manager engineers in us univs or companies and secondly the ones kicked out will not be those who work on cutting edge high tech stuff
india,not_removed,yup the only thing surprising is how long the gravy train was allowed to continue they should have done these changes years ago now lets see if it gets passed and in what form some adjustment to the visa is inevitable though
india,not_removed,youre right but since this affects indias interests a protest should be lodged not that it will do much
india,not_removed,why should modi give a shit about this move
india,not_removed,he shouldnt but he would if he can bend for a nobrainer thing like jallikattu he will definitely do something about this remember his fundraisers in the us will all be badly affected by this
india,not_removed,and an internal matter yes its an internal matter but saying it wont completely affect india is little idiotic lot of money is remitted to india by nris every month also i agree modi shouldnt give a shit
india,not_removed,and an internal matter yes its an internal matter but saying it wont completely affect india is little idiotic lot of money is remitted to india by nris every month also i agree modi shouldnt give a shit
india,not_removed,vague understanding let me give you a vaguer reply everyone can be replaced be it america or india
india,not_removed,but his right hand is much hotter though
india,not_removed,i literally saw shit on the street in nj no kidding
india,not_removed,im not sure but hdi wise it could be comparable to a thirdworld country not really not even close
india,not_removed,an isolated case doesnt become the norm you would be hard pressed to find more than ppl on who earn more than that who have just graduated less than years ago for experienced engg with greater than yrs experience yes they may be getting that
india,not_removed,if you dont see whats wrong here then you are beyond help the system as it stands today is not working as intended the people being hired arent topnotch outside experts for the most part period why do you care if its not working as intended for the us it is working for india the and programs have allowed india to export relatively highend services to american companies develop a robust skillbase in india bring in foreign exchange and whether directly or indirectly pull hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty iow it has been a huge boon to the economy as an indian i see nothing wrong here its funny that indians are more concerned about whether a program is working as intended for the us or whether it is unfair to american workers rather than focusing on whether it benefits their own country remember that was designed for experts who defines what an expert is to a prospective client of an it services provider anyone who can make computers do stuff without manual input or build web applications that streamline their business is an expert ive seen supposedly average thirdyear students studying csit in india work magic with python when i can barely program a crude excel macro i think they were all experts are you telling me that infy are sitting on people who can rival the best of the best of svseattle at a fraction of the cost they can obviously outcompete the best of svseattle in terms of overall value which considers cost as well as benefits thats why theyre able to win contracts despite the presence of labour laws that impose restrictions on them
india,not_removed,i know person from infy in the us who is working on a similar thing which you described rest of them also from different companies are just testers
india,not_removed,what does that have to do with this bill
india,not_removed,lol ok
india,not_removed,average starting mba salary in north america was in an immigrant basically needs to be better than average to qualify you are implying that an us company only hires immigrants because they are cheaper which is not true except in the it sector many firms anyway pay higher than the cap undergrad students are screwed though except in exceptional cases i suppose
india,not_removed,one thing i worry about is the skill quality of american workers isnt it like those who are hired by us companies to come and work in us via interview screening process etc are better in skill level can work at less cost compared to their native us counterparts why would a company hire from outside usa if there is talent inside usa it makes me wonder if talent is lacking in usa
india,not_removed,i dont think it applies retrospectively but not sure in the future if the bill is passed yes students not getting an offer will not be provided a visa this is set to xtimes some median benchmark so the figure will change as average salaries change without requiring a future bill
india,not_removed,well assuming that the democrat bill passes the minimum salary that qualifies for is or alternately according to a similar republican bill so to get employed postuni you need to land a job paying that much its obviously much more difficult as an undergrad applicant versus a more qualified mbamasters applicant i am not saying its impossible just much more difficult so dont rely on obtaining employment after you are done imo you could reconsider if you are entirely loanfinanced and therefore dependent on a job to recoup your investment if you have a safety net and a getting a jobs important but not the end of the world you can still go ahead a us degree is pretty valuable and its a great experience dont decide now wait for some bill to actually get passed nothings decided currently when the decision is finalised i expect a spurt of articles discussing this very situation probably with better advice anyway best of luck which uni are you planning
india,not_removed,depends on the role companies dont pay you on the basis of almamater
india,not_removed,hain master students can command that kind of a ctc unsure about undergrads
india,not_removed,dualintent there for whatever is primary purpose of visa studyjob want to immigrate to us
india,not_removed,actually here is the thing unless tcs and infosys both are doing the same around the world which they are not then american companies do not become more or less competitive sure profits will go down a bit because the labour goes back to the pre tcs and infosys abuse years indians arent being treated like cattle with ridiculously lower wages being right on the level of living and longer times plus being chained to the company also the second part where american corps pays taxes jeez you must be kidding right not only do they try their hardest to pay the least amount of taxes not to mention in trumps america the taxes are going to be ridiculously lowered but this is just my economics based opinion i realised from first hand experience that economics as a subject is not even close to what it is in cbse class rooms go learn what economics is really about possibly the concept of ceteris paribus
india,not_removed,this is the most likely fall out academia will bleed heavily because a lot of those either already on tenure track or waiting their chance in stem arent americans the scientific community is going to take a big hit
india,not_removed,were you hired in san diego sf boston manhattan vs rtp atlanta or a city in florida how does this make sense to a have a fixed number while within us these are adjusted per the cost of living for same positions a studio apt in sf rents for around while you can get the same in gainesville for around
india,not_removed,i agree people in sv are very safe perhaps seattle too msft gives k target bonus these guys just barely make it though
india,not_removed,ye by tech i meant cs actually my friend in electrical got a job in apple and hes making a literal ton of cash over right now year u cant join defence contractor unless ur us citizen ye the other majors will have issues
india,not_removed,a lot of grads dont get into west coast tech firms also west coast tech firms dont usually pay these salaries i beg to differ most of my friends are getting starting upwards of but base is normally within the rest is rsu also this is probably base salary as your performance linked bonus and future stock vests are not counted as salary in your filings howwhy if ur contract says that you will get so and so stock every quartermonthyear how is that not part of salary i agree performance bonus shouldnt count stocks should if it doesnt ill simply ask employer to give me higher base and less stocks they are quite flexible at least mine are when it comes to this
india,not_removed,if you mean new england by ne you arewere underpaid at a big if its nebraska i am not sure this of course if you started in last years not sure about things before then
india,not_removed,on a side note is pretty impressive thanks i started with one of big in west coast
india,not_removed,sherlock
india,not_removed,who could have guessed nobody could have guessed actually most politicians dont implement the promises they get elected on see obama for example
india,not_removed,no whats rich is that cheap narrowminded uninspired inflexible engineers from turd world india are giving the supposed bestofthebestofthebest a run for their money
india,not_removed,which is now worth shit the whole real estate sector is in serious slowdown due to unaffordability and you are saying real estate investments are shit maybe if you bought property in the last years
india,not_removed,nah they are still around its just that these past few months have been a significant reality check on the personality cult of dear leader give it some more time
india,not_removed,but the republicans agree with it right
india,not_removed,ex with stocks and target bonus in it
india,not_removed,unless you work at facebook or google
india,not_removed,can u read her job description again pls cause no she dnt do her job her job is not to uphold the law its to be a lawyer for us govt and enforce the laws passed by us govt her job is not to judge laws as per constitution the job ur describing is the one that federal judges and supreme court justices do
india,not_removed,exec branch to be precise which is basically pres even still both houses are rep
india,not_removed,she dnt do her job her job is not to fight based on her personal view of the constitution her job is to fight for executive branch of govt look even if you are a criminal and you hire a lawyer the lawyer even if he knows ur guilt is supposed to defend u esp after u pay them imagine paying the lawyer and then he says no i wont fight for u
india,not_removed,right since im already in we can tell the rest to fuck off
india,not_removed,good luck when canada wants more immigration rather than less
india,not_removed,even ms grads dont get right after graduation i personally oversee masters grads at my job and they dont get more than me and i dont even make more than of course i dont live in silicon valley do the salary levels are slightly lower but i still dont think fresh masters grads can make unless theyre from ivy leagues or other top tier colleges
india,not_removed,somewhere in my heart i feel nice because now you just cant enroll into degree mills like utd or asu or sjsu with your rich dads black money just dont know if is realistic
india,not_removed,that quota was specifically for india so does that mean the rat race will become even more competitive
india,not_removed,check my edit apparently the rule change is only for dependent employers
india,not_removed,umm there is no logic here before ppl got hired now still ppl get hired the only difference is there is less competition for those seats
india,not_removed,research scientists and assistant professors in universities or research labs wont make the salary cut we will definitely gain many brains only managers and software engineers make that high salary in us they wont be coming back
india,not_removed,lauda gain you are right because most of these will be men i agree with your perspective
india,not_removed,which leaves the program the perfect lowhanging fruit for trump to score some brownie points with his constituents made even lower by the fact that donald trumps businesses wont be affected by its gutting and trust me if indian cobol developers are summarily sent back there wont even be the gentle consolation of crowds of aclu lawyers with free legal help for those affected at the airport or impassioned articles in the times
india,not_removed,if he can bend for a nobrainer thing like jallikattu false equivalency imo jalikattu should have never been banned in the first place and instead should have been more heavily regulated but thats a completely separate issue remember his fundraisers in the us will all be badly affected by this i doubt people earning donated much anyway remember high paying jobs and existing jobs arent affected entrepreneurs and business owners arent effected except the it sector in the shortmedium term till they adjust
india,not_removed,lot of money is remitted to india by nris every month a drop in the bucket barely matters in the larger scheme of things remember the actual high paying jobs are still valid a bigger concern for india is the it sector but unfair advantages dont last forever
india,not_removed,i know places like camden newark are shit but how are areas like parsippany hoboken morristown
india,not_removed,whose shit was it thats important i have seen dog poop on the streets in italyparis as well xd
india,not_removed,you dont think this hurts india as it removes higher skill positions from the workforce and promotes a lower skill average staying
india,not_removed,thats why theyre able to win contracts despite the presence of labour laws that impose restrictions on them they bypass the restrictions they do visa fraud day in day out ive seen supposedly average thirdyear students studying csit in india work magic with python my hit rate is roughly per people while recruiting and resumes come to me already filtered out of the are quite bad people i can eliminate in minutes over the telephone and many of those are people with years or more of experience and in good companies most service companies work on quantity brute forcing to get stuff working
india,not_removed,the primary reason why companies hire outside us is because of talent pool for instance every second person in bangalore is a software engineer so it makes sense for a us company to have a cost center in bangalore if you take dollar to inr ratio its much favorable for us company to have cost center in india for salary of a single developer roughly you can hire three developers i cant talk about talent in us but most of my experience with folks in us is that they move towards leadership role than stick on to technical roles also us developers have strict work life balance and dont typically work overtime for freesilent ps what i stated about us developer is my own opinion and experience
india,not_removed,it makes me wonder if talent is lacking in usa then why did sv become so important in the first place it has more to do with the fact that if you can select from billion instead of why wouldnt you
india,not_removed,i guess it will come into picture when you need to renew your as someone brought up above
india,not_removed,deleted
india,not_removed,sure there is a slight variation in the pay based on which almamater you graduate from but there is also a difference in the pay on entry level jobs across the country which varies from consider this as well a senior software engineer in silicon valley graduated from one of the us universities will have salary starting from while a person with same designation from an indian it firm will not receive more than
india,not_removed,pretty much everyone other than it in sv is going to take a big hit academia more so because there is very little chance they could be making this amount
india,not_removed,i am saying the same thing
india,not_removed,haha a apt in metro atlanta rents for gainesville and atlanta are not comparable
india,not_removed,i think this is based on the base payment and not the total compensation it is mentioned in so comment in this thread
india,not_removed,true that tech companies pay premium but these jobs are far and few to come by especially for my major such as robotics
india,not_removed,i beg to differ most of my friends are getting starting upwards of but base is normally within the rest is rsu nopes average salaries in tech are lower than even in cali with a very low number of entry level grads getting those salaries again it depends on what your degree was mba yeah sure i can get it but ms would be difficult to justify such a high package on an average emphasis on average howwhy if ur contract says that you will get so and so stock every quartermonthyear how is that not part of salary you vest xyz stock based on your initial stock grant which is linked to your performance the organization is usually under no compulsion to continue giving you new stock grants if your performance does not justify it they are compelled to give you your base salary on filings organizations usually only mention your base salary and not the rsus awarded or even your signing bonus if it is supposed to be provided over a period of months as many tech companies do if it doesnt ill simply ask employer to give me higher base and less stocks they are quite flexible at least mine are when it comes to this usually large firms are inflexible and rightly so with their compensation policies they simply dont allow individual employees to choose whether they want to be paid in cash or in rsus i guess you work at a startup even they provide rsus to avoid the cash burn that comes with paying salaries
india,not_removed,i beg to differ most of my friends are getting starting upwards of but base is normally within the rest is rsu that happens only for software engineering and hardcore technical positions
india,not_removed,dont think so by ne i mean the northeast us i studied graduated and worked in a major city from that area not nyc it was substantially above what my classmates got too americans included this was in
india,not_removed,i think umeowthechow is talking about in finance not cs
india,not_removed,btw you had an awesome career months back but days back you were in university and now you have a job again bhai sab khairiyat or are you a bundle of sticks days back op is sad but university is starting months back awesome career must give it to op inspite of a career that keeps on changing he has maintained the fact that he is undesirable to women because op is a bundle a sticks
india,not_removed,to be fair he has stood by all his bad promises
india,not_removed,i enjoy your writing and youre one of the few reasons i keep coming back to the cess pit of stupidity that is rindia im looking to have a thoughtful discussion and dispute a couple of your assertions it is also true that usa doesnt produce as many citizens who are stem graduates as the industries here need freddie isnt your run of the mill fox news loving hack i think he makes a compelling argument to say that america actually produces enough stem grads and whats rich is that cheap narrowminded uninspired inflexible engineers from turd world india are giving the supposed bestofthebestofthebest a run for their money again the core argument is on price not quality trump is only saying if you want to employ an indian do so but do so at an acceptable wage if indian engineers were as good as american ones wouldnt clients be happy to pay the same amount of money for them
india,not_removed,im sure bosdi baba ramdev has some decoction or asana for your delusion or you could try some hanuman yantratantramantra on late night tv
india,not_removed,you are saying real estate investments are shit yes you wont be able to sell your multicrore properties in white anymore anybody who coughs up that amount in white will get the transaction flagged by it
india,not_removed,yep waiting for another cess and its justification
india,not_removed,yep lets wait till after march
india,not_removed,the highskilled integrity and fairness act of introduced by california congressman
india,not_removed,the headlines says thats why you should always read the article and not shoot from the hip based on just reading a misleading headline remember that the people writing headlines are not the same people writing the articles
india,not_removed,depends on who you ask marco rubio is bought by disney and wanted to double the number of visas with no added conditions on salaries but you never know with trump
india,not_removed,thats immensely satisfying
india,not_removed,it might reach in top percentile with bonus et al but in this bill is base
india,not_removed,fb and google does not constitute the average tech worker
india,not_removed,heres her confirmation hearing scroll to and listen to what senator jeff sessions is asking of her ironically hes been nominated to be her replacement
india,not_removed,from where did you get your law degree
india,not_removed,ivy league graduates arent making in nonitnonmba roles either atleast not in the initial years
india,not_removed,its only hardcore software and technical grads who get paid that much in silicon valley
india,not_removed,exactly the simple math is that youve got to add more than to the companys bottomline if not then youre a loss for the company
india,not_removed,at the risk of sounding schadenfreudist me too couldnt go to us in and coz no monies sort of feel vindicated its not all good though it will increase competition for good jobs here in india so a mixed bag really
india,not_removed,now theres no cap based on countries but on the other hand is too much it should reduce competition the way i see it i could be wrong though
india,not_removed,i think there would be some special rule for people in research american law makers are atleast that smart so they wont be coming back neither would the rockstar programmers or managers
india,not_removed,that is true but there are tons of modibhakts in places like texas who are pulling in less than
india,not_removed,and how do you create jobs without any govt incentives redtape crab mentality lack of funding also creating jobs require a lot of sacrifices including loss of monthly steady pay not forgeting the loss in remittance which contribute significantly to our gdp
india,not_removed,when youve lived in india all your life you can make out the difference between dog poop and human poop like indian poop is yellow because of the haldi
india,not_removed,look as a highly skilled product of a toptier graduate program in the us who has been through the pain of the process ill say this the it coolies from infosys and tcs who go to the us in droves are of far more benefit to india than people like me are its simple the companies that employ these indians earn money through exports contribute to indias gdp and pay taxes in india the employees also tend to remit more money back though my evidence is purely anecdotal highly skilled expert indians who work in the us for american companies after graduation from us universities do not benefit india as much
india,not_removed,they bypass the restrictions they do visa fraud day in day out no they may exploit loopholes but every corporate entity in the world does that my hit rate is roughly per people while recruiting and resumes come to me already filtered out of the are quite bad people i can eliminate in minutes over the telephone the plural of anecdote is not data this story could also be taken as an example of a recruiters impossibly high standards most service companies work on quantity brute forcing to get stuff working this is not necessarily a bad thing everyone plays to their strengths its quite telling that these unsophisticated bruteforcing companies are outperforming their american counterparts who supposedly use more elegant methods in the market
india,not_removed,for salary of a single developer roughly you can hire three developers infywiprotcs hires like developers for that amount
india,not_removed,if a person with the same designation from an indian it firm can function better than the ivy grad he will be given a better salary the persons skills are the primary factor for getting a good salary
india,not_removed,which is harsh considering those in academia perhaps making their way to tenure might have already spent years in the us as a grad student and post doc making low pay i know of many in similar conditions who have bought cars houses and what not hoping to live in the us forever
india,not_removed,i was posting this reply to through my phone seems it messed up
india,not_removed,you get the point
india,not_removed,dude read the bill itself nondiscretionary bonuses and similar compensation may be applied to wages based on their fair market value at the time of filing anyway it wudnt make sense to not include stocks companies will just pay higher base and not pay stock
india,not_removed,you vest xyz stock based on your initial stock grant which is linked to your performance the organization is usually under no compulsion to continue giving you new stock grants if your performance does not justify it i think different companies have different rules my company is straight up giving stocks without performance if i perform well i will get fresher stocks meaning additional stocks to what i have but if i perform bad no way i can not get paid the stocks i am promised so if i get paid say stocks a month that will continue regardless for next years however if i perform well i might get per month from next year usually large firms are inflexible and rightly so with their compensation policies they simply dont allow individual employees to choose whether they want to be paid in cash or in rsus i guess you work at a startup even they provide rsus to avoid the cash burn that comes with paying salaries i dnt work at startup i dunno how flexible it is but from everyone around me they seem to say its very flexible
india,not_removed,most of the indians come for that though
india,not_removed,sorry i think is right i assumed big of tech i have no idea about salaries in big accounting firms
india,not_removed,im doing uni and job at same time hcp program
india,not_removed,hey thanks the problem may not be the raw number of stem or it workers but the number of workers with the requisite skills who are able to perform the work required of them in a costeffective manner the core argument is on price not quality trump is only saying if you want to employ an indian do so but do so at an acceptable wage it appears to me that trump is preventing the employment of indian labour at a rate that the markets are willing to bear hes imposing restrictions on them because without those american labour simply isnt competitive in a country that almost religiously clings to the idea of a private enterprise and free markets the acceptable wage should be dictated by that market and not by the head of state if indian engineers were as good as american ones wouldnt clients be happy to pay the same amount of money for them thats something for the clients to answer each one has a specific need that hes looking to fulfil at a specific price point one cant put them all in the same basket some of them simply do not have the budget to hire a usbased firm with american engineers if walmart is as good as whole foods or target wouldnt customers be happy to pay the same amount for the products they sell and yet they sell goods at much cheaper prices than their competitors do and corner a huge portion of the market thats their competitive advantage and its absurd to posit that they shouldnt be using it same goes for indian it services companies
india,not_removed,wow you sure are angry why are you so angry
india,not_removed,properties being multicrore is the problem they coming down in price is the solution
india,not_removed,doesnt that mean more competition for us at home
india,not_removed,it says nondiscretionary income including bonus can be counted towards the it would be really dumb actually to make base as most wages are earned through stocks esp higher up the ladder companies will simply increase base then and lower stocks which would negatively affect nyse andor nasdaq it literally says nondiscretionary bonuses and similar compensation may be applied to wages based on their fair market value at the time of filing
india,not_removed,it is ironic but read the attorney general white house page for job description
india,not_removed,read up on duties of ag if u dnt believe me
india,not_removed,you guys get joy out of the misery of others sad
india,not_removed,but some say that these companies dont pay taxes in india because they are incorporated elsewhere
india,not_removed,they may exploit loopholes doing fraud is not the same as exploiting loopholes
india,not_removed,add accenture to that
india,not_removed,thanks for clarifying
india,not_removed,i beg to differ on that
india,not_removed,seems to match what ive heard for analyst positions they typically get lower than cs sals
india,not_removed,hold up you came to the us got a job based on your undergrad degree which i presume was in a india and are still pursuing ms in cs part time you really are a unicorn
india,not_removed,if walmart is as good as whole foods or target exactly but the point is walmart insnt as good as whole foods theyre happy to accept that they sell to a politely speaking different class of people if tcs wants to bill itself the walmart of tech im happy to accept that claim but the argument that youre trying to make correct me if im wrong is that tcs provides wholefoods quality service at walmart quality prices or is capable of providing wholefoods quality service if they charged wholefoods prices my argument is tcs is great at being walmart but it doesnt have the talent to be wholefoods
india,not_removed,how would they come down in price when they paid hundreds of crores themselves even if they were to sell it half the price they bought it at theres no way anyone can arrange that money in white
india,not_removed,most of the onsite people are ass lickers anyway
india,not_removed,my bad sorry
india,not_removed,this needs to be seen by people yates confirmation hearing start watching at jeff sessions who if confirmed will be attorney general tells yates that she will have to say no to the president if he asks her to enforce something that is against the law she promises that she will defend the law and defy the president if necessary copied from rnews
india,not_removed,its mixed feelings really i was within an inch of going in and now im hearing that trumpet is going to reduce opt im kinda glad it didnt work out for me the way i wanted it to kind of underlines it for me what happens happens for the best other than that its mostly mixed feelings
india,not_removed,mind your own business
india,not_removed,some do some dont they definitely bring revenue into india invest a large portion their profits in india and spend money in india which generates business for several other entities
india,not_removed,thats one company accused of committing fraud for one type of visa which incidentally is not the and then settling the case out of court this doesnt quite paint the picture of systemic day in and day out abuse that youre implying in your post
india,not_removed,perhaps maybe im in an echo chamber fyi the indian gdp per capita in america was the highest by far was touching which means family of with working spouses means an income of a year
india,not_removed,no no none of that lol did undergrad in us took a loan for it got a good job here actually more than but we will assume i am doing msphd from stanford part time while working i am trying to see if i can get phd but right now fulfilling ms requirements dnt wna do phd alone too boring
india,not_removed,the point is walmart insnt as good as whole foods by what metric though there has been no definitive independent study concluding that the quality of goods sold by whole foods is any better than those sold by walmart my experience anecdotal as it is bears this out whole foods offers a better ambience orangic foods whose health benefits are questionable and a feeling of exclusivity but on an objective scale its wares are not superior as for tcs it is the walmart of tech i dont think anybody casts tcs as this huge innovation machine making pathbreaking advancements in technology it competes chiefly on the basis of cost and quite often wins against the usbased it arms of highend services companies like deloitte and accenture why then should it raise prices
india,not_removed,then they will come down even further the buyers will sell at a loss if required unfortunately this hasnt happened yet real estate prices are as high as ever
india,not_removed,p
india,not_removed,httpswwwjusticegovagaboutoffice interesting i think it can be interpreted as per the person cause their job is to represent the president not give judgement on what they think of the presidents decision there were a lot of ppl on politics and news saying she will be fired as soon as she refused to fight for the ban in courts so it was not as unexpected as ppl make it sound even cnn anchors said trump was right to do what he did
india,not_removed,accused of committing fraud for one type of visa no its exploiting loopholes
india,not_removed,if you are talking about indian citizens in us that makes sense these are the people who have worked in the us for at least years and are most probably in a managerial role now
india,not_removed,you majored in cs as well
india,not_removed,and quite often wins against the usbased it arms of highend services companies like deloitte and accenture i agree with you with the basic argument that tcs has the low end it market nailed and deloitte it accenture it kpmg it all very much fall into this bracket im not disputing tcs engineers can outcompete kpmg engineers im disputing whether tcs engineers can outcompete google engineers i guess our analogy falls apart because im saying a ferrari is a better car than a toyota while youre saying it depends on how much money youre willing to spend thank you for the discussion i enjoyed reading your thoughts and eagerly read your defense posts please keep them coming
india,not_removed,i was just continuing with the vague reply thingy also why wont a person think for himself self before desh self here includes significant others too
india,not_removed,salaries in us are not like india they go up very slowly wages have been stagnant for a long time here and unless u perform u will get like raise a year not like india with raises
india,not_removed,you do realize that the best way to get a raise is to switch jobs hell i got a raise in switching my job in the us
india,not_removed,yes but u rnt gna switch jobs times in a decade right and the raise in india is still higher without even switching
india,not_removed,we need really strict immigration policies and make sure there is quality control that way both crimes against africans and by africans will decrease atleast in pune one of the reasons for racism against africans is due to the fact that many african students have been found to be indulging in illegal activities overstaying their visas and selling drugs etc in goa african immigrants have gone as far as to form mafia rings if the attacks aginst afeicans have to stop then the perception of africans being criminals needs to change they have to be seen as contributing members of society they need to be seen as doctors engineers or successful entrepreneurs and that can only be done if we only let in such people and turn away bad elements tldr bring in strict immigration controls racism against africans is a two way street both sides are to blame
india,not_removed,the problem has sides that said we are going to see a lot of racists use this as an excuse for crimes against africans
india,not_removed,lets not conflate one incident and blame an entire continent for it that would be like westerners thinking all indian males are rapists since so many rape stories seem to hit worldnews
india,not_removed,the same issue we faced in my area there were couple of africans mostly nigerians who overstayed their visa and were involved in a drugring it was only when one of them raped and killed a girl and threw her body in the nullah did police took everyone in people stopped renting their homes to the immigrants too
india,not_removed,such opinons are dismissed as racism unfortunately some people may point out that we have idiots at home too but that does not justify letting in more idiots from other countries

india,not_removed,i dont really think so most people wont want toable to afford ikea anyway i really like some of their products so i am pretty happy ill be able buy them now
india,not_removed,the local industry was looting customers and providing subpar craftsmanship that didnt last and then they charged outrageous prices for repairs which also didnt last such conditions lead to the rise of major furniture brands like tangent durian etc people want quality control value for money and good designs the local industry wasnt providing any of these things i always welcome new competition to the market it always benefits the customer in the end
india,not_removed,you dont think thats true do you think the kind of people who can afford ikea upper middle class will do two hours of labour at home parsing the instructions and fiddling with screws and tiny screwdrivers to assemble their table which times out of will be squeaky because they didnt do it right so theyll have to take it apart and redo it again after a month ikea works in developed countries because it brands itself as the budget choice budget choice in america is middle class in india
india,not_removed,says the person who has a maid come in to clean

india,not_removed,if someone can buy from ikea he is not upper middle class easily inside the top

india,not_removed,i agree with you that freedom of speech should be absolute but a lot of people will not
india,not_removed,i think the intent and the context matters ur proving my point a question of where do u draw the fine line
india,not_removed,dude read my full comment a question of where do u draw the fine line it could be argued salman is triggering rape victims
india,not_removed,chalo bc kahan aag lagana hai d
india,not_removed,let merit go to hell from now on caste will only get you proper education and jobs
india,not_removed,in fact lets have reservation for of seats its like a birthday cake divide among all in fact all tax payers money should also be divided among all castes in proper percentages why waste time in building schools colleges roads and other infrastructure simply give the money to all castes groups in proper percents that way everyone is happy and this country will soon become utopia
india,not_removed,instead of agitating for increasing size and quality of universities these morons are fighting like crabs for a tiny morsel very saddening
india,not_removed,i support this if everybody has a quota nobody has a quota
india,not_removed,wrong title to accommodate the economically backward classes from amongst rajputs marathas jats patels gujjars and brahmins many of these communities are already fighting for some sort of backward certification this is not for upper castes but ebcs from nonbackward castes while most of you have an opinion either for or against caste based reservation i am sure very few of you are against ebc based reservation
india,not_removed,general category people have taken pointers from the american white people victimhood playbook
india,not_removed,usual upper caste pandering by bjp this time theyre using a dalit leader for whatever reasons it will be thrown out by the courts as usual reservation is not a poverty alleviation program it is a social representation system
india,not_removed,i honestly think a better solution would be one time cashin slip for say generations if your father is employed in a govt service throught reservation you do not deserve the reservation give it to another person whats the point of giving iim reservation to somebody whos already in iit through reservation how much level field can you make if iit cant get you at par with other unreserved people what can
india,not_removed,why not give quota to all castes and religion
india,not_removed,the caste system is dead long live the caste system
india,not_removed,bmc polls are near so these guys have started talking not news worthy
india,not_removed,i think this is to nail down reservation for ever once everyone has reservationsno one can complain for the fear of reservation encroachment kinda like land mafia what was once general will be expunged everyone gets their own reservations and no one talks merit
india,not_removed,bhenchoddo har kisi ko quota chahiye merit jaye tel lene
india,not_removed,its like an open invitation to those who dont know or care about caste leave india
india,not_removed,i have a solution since we invented zero we should invent percentages greater than a for dividing a pie
india,not_removed,what the fucking fuck so glad im done with my education
india,not_removed,i honestly wish to know whats stopping us from shifting to income based subsidies
india,not_removed,because what even merit is its so easy to appease idiots by catering to their caste like this its mortifying
india,not_removed,disgusting
india,not_removed,athawale said those earning an annual income of up to rs lakh from among the forward castes should be given reservation in jobs and education demanding reservation for upper castes dalit leader and minister of state for social justice ramdas athawale said that the present reservation of percent should be increased to per cent so as to accommodate the economically backward classes from amongst rajputs marathas jats patels gujjars and brahmins for this reservations should be increased by another per cent so that the existing quota for sc st and obc remains unaffected the minister said that dalits and all other backward castes would have no problem with such a reservation for the poor among the upper castes as long as it is not from their existing quota as per census the population of scs in the country amounts to per cent sts percent and obcs per cent here are some other news itemscredits to httpindianexpresscomarticleindiaindianewsindiavaranasielaboratesecurityarrangementsaheadofpmmodisvisit im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,all those defending reservation i know you want equalitymost of the poor are from lower castes but there should be equality of opportunity not engineering of equal outcomes reservation doesnt increase the literacy of the lower castes it just ensures the rich lower castes have the monopoly on the benefits of reservation at the expense of poor lower castes expecting these benefits to trickle down to the lower rung of society is as stupid as believing in trickle down economics
india,not_removed,bhai first give proper reservation to obcs population getting reservation
india,not_removed,back to the stone ages i see
india,not_removed,let merit go to hell its gone long long ago
india,not_removed,in that case lets do away with the reservations completely that should level the playing field
india,not_removed,isnt most of the merit seats cornered by upper caste elitist with good scores obtained by hiring expensive private tutoring services
india,not_removed,indian states need to develop large public university systems centered around a central campus in each state such an initiative requires quite a lot of money
india,not_removed,getting a fake income certificate is so much easier than a caste certificate especially if the family has a business ebc reservation is a pipe dream until we tackle this problem
india,not_removed,which has been working so well for them look at their white people victimhood presidential candidate
india,not_removed,let me put forward another instance the argument about income categorisation in caste reservation since i see outraged comments like i bust my ass for two years and someone with half the marks and a bmw got in all governments institutes have an mcm scholarship which stands for merit cum means which entails that you get a substantial portion of your tuition money back if you produce documents showing your parents net income to be below a certain limit guess who it is mostly used by mostly general category kids whose parents have large businesses but who find it much easier to edit their income certificates until we have a standardised systems to weed out such examples we cannot do much institution of the creamy layer barrier is a noble thought and effective implementation should reduce the number of oft quoted examples such as scst reservation but owns a merc that is a broader problem which is exploited by people across the caste divide
india,not_removed,alllivesmatter
india,not_removed,its actually the opposite that is happening the scst and obc representatives here are comparing themselves to black people in the us and its fucking absurd discrimination is nothing compared to what the black people have suffered through
india,not_removed,man that was in bad taste
india,not_removed,why dont people get this reservation is not a poverty alleviation program it is a social representation system
india,not_removed,so just because dalits are popualtion in india they should get that reservation at everything does that also mean all seats should be reserved and distributed according to thier representatioon in system
india,not_removed,yeah and upper castes are not being represented enough
india,not_removed,up polls trump all other polls
india,not_removed,i swear i first thing i thought which polls are coming
india,not_removed,well he is a minister of state of social justice and empowerment not just some random person
india,not_removed,lack of checks and accountability as it is many people take advantage of loopholes in the system regarding the issuing of a simple income certificate to avail scholarships and even reservation in case of the creamy class unless we have that rectified we cant really hope for much
india,not_removed,sorrycouldntstopmyself
india,not_removed,lets do away with caste too while were at it wonder which ones easier hmm
india,not_removed,get this logic thing out of politics mate
india,not_removed,yeah but when they do it its merit its not as if theyve obvious advantages like access to wealth and education for generations or something
india,not_removed,wouldnt the solution to that be improving the education system not handing out college seats based on specious reasoning
india,not_removed,well if that post from a few weeks backs on this sub is to be believed then about of the students who enter iit dont go through those private tutoring avenues this can be extrapolated besides the sound argument has always been reservation on account of economicclassification not casteclassification two birds stone plus morally right as well
india,not_removed,i dont know about other universities but my is wasting a lot of money on a big ass flag that will be installed and yoga classes as mandated by ugc while funds for research are scare already and we have to rely on external sponsor
india,not_removed,we have many universities and most of yum are empty look at mumbai university many are empty we need quality not quantity
india,not_removed,that faking certificates is even a thing doesnt let us stop from giving caste based reservations to continue to be unjust to people stuck in chronic poverty because we cant get one mechanism right is a greater travesty
india,not_removed,are you saying trump will be a bad president no hell be awesome and make america great again hinduswithtrump
india,not_removed,the mcm abuse is so true used to make me furious
india,not_removed,discrimination is nothing compared to what the black people have suffered through you are either ignorant as fuck trolling
india,not_removed,bro the condition of sc sts in india was worse than black slaves because they werent allowed to own property black slaves could become free over time but once a dalit always a dalit at least read shit up man
india,not_removed,there are so many parallels man they are a lot similar than we think
india,not_removed,because people are selfish and they dont see beyond their immediate needs upper caste people are generally over represented in the govt machinery so they do not know the troubles of under representation they look for other problems beyond representation
india,not_removed,because all social evils are due to poverty if poverty is alleviated wed be equally represented socially atleast in college seats
india,not_removed,so why should everything be decided as per percentage of population is it the correct way for a society to progress doesnt it encourages people to have more babies doesnt this very sub keeps crying itself hoarse about rising population if some family has been taking reservation benefits for a few generations and is now financially comfortable isnt it better to stop giving the benefits to that family and let someone else take the place this family is already representing their group so why not let others progress now
india,not_removed,i wonder whats stopping the bjp govt from releasing the caste census considering that will throw light on the prevailing situation of representation
india,not_removed,but this guy is from here so up polls are pretty much inconsequential in mumbai bmc polls are what will make news here
india,not_removed,that makes it even worse
india,not_removed,maybe he should be thinking about establishing more colleges so everyone gets a chance
india,not_removed,ok lets do a social experiment suppose govt brings out a law that says all castes and everything related to castes is banned how many upper castes will support it how many backward castes will support such a law how many on this sub if we cant get the data from all of india im pretty sure the scsts will be foremost in opposing it
india,not_removed,i challenge you to name one way in which the lawgovt still favor the upper castes
india,not_removed,so ℅the people in general category of our population has had access to wealth and education for generations
india,not_removed,dude bust your ass for hours a day for two years in a row then watch as the neighborhood asshole who didnt do jackshit gets through comfortably while you barely scrape in and yes you are right he looked very oppressed when he showed up to the coaching institute in his merc caste ke naam pe bc self flagellation kab tak karoge
india,not_removed,you hate upper caste folks
india,not_removed,yes but that would take at least another century considering how fucked up our education system is its the long term solution though yes
india,not_removed,many students liemany undergo online coaching or correspondence courses nowadays which they do not reveal otherwise why are coaching centres mushrooming in every nook and corner of the country
india,not_removed,til clinton is not white
india,not_removed,seriously man most of that money goes to buying iphones and drinking out
india,not_removed,and upper caste
india,not_removed,some guy is saying condition of sc sts in india is worse than black slaves but sure im the one thats trolling
india,not_removed,what the actual fuck did you even read what youd typed before you clicked save how is not allowed own property comparable to getting beaten hung raped and killed and just because they have a big fucking war over slavery doesnt discount the constant racism and discrimination the black people face for the way they look
india,not_removed,take that bullshit somewhere elsei dont know what part of the country you are living inbut here in my city there isnt any over representation of any castebut thats the advantage of living in one of the cosmopolitan
india,not_removed,if some family has been taking reservation benefits for a few generations and is now financially comfortable isnt it better to stop giving the benefits to that family and let someone else take the place this family is already representing their group so why not let others progress now first this problem is not because of reservation just remove the word reservation in the sentence you wrote and it still holds true this is a problem and it is wrong and it should be regulated second one of the main problems in debating pros and cons of reservation is that we dont have enough data points and for reason one could guess the govt has not been releasing this data once thats released it might turn out that the of mbcscst misusing reservationsbenefits of reservation going to richer families is probably too little
india,not_removed,ssh we dont say that here upper castes are the ones who are being oppressed go with the circlejerk
india,not_removed,i agree with you there caste census does need to be released but if im not mistaken congress was also sitting on the results so whatever the reason for delay all parties seem complicit
india,not_removed,he is a central minister too i guess and he is asking about talking to pm not maha cm its all just pandering to upper caste voters to not let them stray
india,not_removed,the world has finite resources and a majority of it is controlled by a few everyone isnt getting a chance
india,not_removed,suppose govt brings out a law that says all castes and everything related to castes is banned most caste discrimination is ingrained and not something that is sanctioned by the state when somebody picks a slightly less qualified guy with a brahmin name over somebody better qualified with a dalit name completely unconsciously not even really registering that hes doing it thats something the state has zero control over ive seen it happen a million times
india,not_removed,can you point out one field of achievement academics sports politics etc where the backward castes are represented in proportion to their population if they arent then whats the reason for it systemic discrimination or theyre just not good enough
india,not_removed,favouring upper castes dude weve been favouring upper castes for centuries you want more favours
india,not_removed,i challenge you to give one reason for which caste should be relevant in this day and age
india,not_removed,the goal is equality of opportunity right poor people exist in every caste religion and other unnecessary divisions of society shouldnt they all have the equality of opportunity
india,not_removed,oh my god youve stumbled on a gem the actual privileged few amounts to around not more the sc sts are around and obcs are at least so essentially of the privileged population still has access to of the seats congratulations you just had an epiphany
india,not_removed,every single system that humans have ever come up with is abused welfare systems in countries ranging from the us to sweden are all abused to some extent proposing throwing away a system precisely because you get frustrated when you see people abusing it is ridiculous yes i know it sucks but it does not logically follow that the system should be removed
india,not_removed,dalits owning merc next time you find such a dalit take a picture seriously because i havent seen any dalits in a merc maybe because i dont have dalit friends hahaha that was a joke i do also cracking entrances is still tough even if youre a dalit i mean its not as if you get to show up and get a seat for free
india,not_removed,can you come up with an original argument ive heard this one hundreds of times
india,not_removed,no im one lol personally i dont believe in caste but i do see casteism everyday downvoted for being upper caste now thats discrimination
india,not_removed,i hear that comment from closed minded people all the time criticising caste inequality is not about hating upper castes however the truth of the matter is that they have reaped the most privileges due to the system some people get touchy when thats mentioned because they interpret it as a personal attack its not
india,not_removed,but surely that would come earlier if we stopped putting people into college where they cant keep up leading to a loss of productivity and therefore output for india thereby perpetuating their poverty
india,not_removed,because the percentage that came out of that study was not ie many students do benefit meaning there is demand for all types of things plus its an industry and hence is operating under market dynamics wherein it actively does pr and marketing which is very competent and effective its natural to see why they would flourish
india,not_removed,good one 🙏🙏🙏
india,not_removed,it doesnt make any sense to play the suffering olympics but look at both groups now both are suffering immensely due to a history they cannot shake off for scst how are you going to play on the field of merit when your ancestors family etc were not allowed to learn for so many centuries for blacks how are you going to play on the field of merit when your ancestors family etc were not allowed to learn for so many centuries wow theyre a lot more similar than i thought
india,not_removed,please pass the koolaid do you think dalits arent raped and killed how out of touch are you go read a newspaper once in a while geez your cluelessness about your fellow countrymen is pretty embarrassing
india,not_removed,lol cosmopolitan city doesnt prevent you from the caste reality of india you just dont see the caste without reservation in promotions the composition of govt hierarchy is woefully under represented by dalits i hope you know what safai karamcharies means thats what most dalits work as if im not wrong thats reserved for dalits
india,not_removed,haha i know
india,not_removed,of course congress is also a casteist party that they only had years to consolidate and release the consensus can be considered a small excuse after years it is looking like they just want to never release it i hope mulayam raises the issue before the up elections
india,not_removed,for whatever reason consolidation of dalit votes against national parties duh
india,not_removed,he is the central minister because of the upcoming bmc polls
india,not_removed,exactly so improve availability instead of rationing the supply merit should be the only critery with financial support for poor kids as affirmative action fuck this caste based quotas
india,not_removed,no one can really help if that is the case can they you can give these vagues feelings based and anecdotal evidences but they really dont mean anything now do they if anything these reservation politics only let this divide run deep reservation cant seem to help the problem then lets drop it completely
india,not_removed,represented in proportion to their population how about we check if the deserving people are being represented in proportion irrespective of their backgrounds
india,not_removed,i dont know who has been favouring upper castes i must have missed the memo when we didnt have money to go to a private school or eat proper meal for years stop being an ass in assuming that all so called upper caste people are well off
india,not_removed,dude weve been favouring upper castes for centuries who are these we and what have they favoured
india,not_removed,what does that even mean should we start a dalitlivesmatter movement here how do you propose to fix the problem
india,not_removed,it shouldnt be my point was that the govt has already gotten rid of the caste system it really doesnt make any point to have reservations now obviously both op and you are too thick to get it scst i presume
india,not_removed,you are saying that unreserved oppurtunitiesseats go to the general category previleged arent they open for anyone irrespective of caste they are just unreserved also does this sounds logical that some reserved seats go to waste just cause they were ear marked for backward classes or the cut off marks is it logical to normalize the obviously brighter candidate to bring in a clearly less deserving candidate massively low score
india,not_removed,nope getting rid of reservations is totally logical heres what i think ill use iits as an example premise every caste on avg gets the same quality of people im talking about the innate ability premise the split of poor in india is with being scst parts of obc this results in a much lower starting point for these kids and as a result we havehad the disproportionate representation of these groups in iits what you say lets lower the bar for these kids so that they can finally escape the self perpetuating poverty cycle noble thought i concede what happens now some people do infact take advantage of this opportunity and make full use of it good for them but many dont im not saying everyone who comes through reservations performs badly at iit im saying the vast majority of poor performers get in through reservation google the iit roorkee incident where around of the people who were about to be expelled for under performance were scstobc is it their fault fuck no without going to the same schools and coaching centres that the rich people went to its naive to hope that these guys will magically catch up once thrust into this precarious situation my conclusion why not govt sponsored quality schoolingfrom class to and entrance coaching for scstobc kids this will remove the problem of rich scst kids abusing the current system equip the lower caste kids with the skills required to compete with those fortunate enough to be born rich same bar of entry for everyone no scope of whining later like im doing now more than anything else truly levels the playing field with everyone having to work equally hard to get in
india,not_removed,it actually does make sense to remove the flawed systems see whenever state enters as a parent and pretends to take care of masses by giving away the money they dont have a right to have it taxes in the first place they generally screw up its not their money they got that from us i dont need to tell you how people are with other peoples money also ofcourse there should be welfare but govt cant play that role that needs to come form people as an act of charity
india,not_removed,next time you find such a dalit take a picture not a picture but a
india,not_removed,you could get negative marks in mains last year and qualify for advanced as a reserved candidate
india,not_removed,often times the cutoffs for sc candidates are genrally lower than general category i would call that significantly easier also sir ms mayawati is a dalit she has loads of money
india,not_removed,i will come up with an alternate argument when this one is answered satisfactorily all i get is is personal attacks and caste system oppressed people hurr durr i think we should concentrate on providing a uniform starting pointbetterfree schooling than rewarding people for their ancestors misery tell me why im wrong
india,not_removed,i dont think reservations perpetuate poverty if anything it allows the disadvantaged to rise up the ranks as for productivity drop well thats a debatable suggestion too since dalits arent really in top positions like ceos who can fire at will the private sector eg has poor dalit representation there have been allegations of dalits being refused promotions by upper caste seniors too the whole they dont deserve it argument is really flawed the privileged upper castes whove been rich andor educated for many generations dont deserve it too because they got rich by oppressing dalits
india,not_removed,suffering olympics fuck youre eloquent im gonna use this phrase
india,not_removed,do you even how comparison works im not saying dalits arent discriminated against im saying comparing them to blacks in the us and their history is fucking absurd please pass the koolaid sure that might improve your reading comprehension
india,not_removed,only dalits are raped and killed
india,not_removed,if mullahyam or lalluu or maya or whoever wanted to raise this they would have they are not so they are definitely trying to hide something and after all this time they still release it i wouldnt discount the possibility that the results have been tampered with
india,not_removed,can you explain how this happens
india,not_removed,okk two birds one stone acceptable
india,not_removed,in my limited experience the reservation system is solving problems in maharashtra a decade ago cutoffs for obcs were well behind open category today theyre almost the same with a difference of maybe marks
india,not_removed,which is what im asking really if of the population only has representation in the highest places is it only because theyre not deserving
india,not_removed,yeah right its not as if we have subsidies for the poor and free tuition till college for them i went to a government school and studied in a government college too and i think im middle class wth are you on about poverty and casteism are two separate ills both are being addressed separately dont mix the two thats disingenuous
india,not_removed,we are the indian society what have they favoured i would love to tell you about indian history but it would take me an hour to type that thing out how about you start by reading some of ambedkars speeches
india,not_removed,how about ending caste system for starters for real this time start with banning caste based matrimonial ads
india,not_removed,scst i presume that is gold man brilliant way to rationalise your points
india,not_removed,firstly i am not scst i dont want to continue with my caste but sure i was born in an upper caste family and i didnt face any rejection in either my engineering or bschool because of my upper caste secondly you must be living in a different universe if you thought the govt has already gotten rid of the caste system
india,not_removed,oh dear youre an obviously misguided person can you look up the word irony and then read your comment in light of that new information
india,not_removed,great question thank you for asking the answer fortunately lies within your question you are saying that unreserved oppurtunitiesseats go to the general category previleged arent they open for anyone irrespective of caste they are just unreserved so dalits are taking unreserved seats also does this sounds logical that some reserved seats go to waste just cause they were ear marked for backward classes so dalits are not making it past the cut off in other words dalits are not making it past the cutoff yet they are qualifying as unreserved candidates schrodingers dalit
india,not_removed,abuse
india,not_removed,lmao
india,not_removed,why did he get the scholarship afaik there are no caste based scholarships in government colleges also in scholarships every year what college is this and how do i sign up also the whole point of reservations is representation not economic upliftment does he have a mercedes good so far ive found dalits with mercedes that makes it only million more to go
india,not_removed,first of all do you know the person the tweet is about hes a freaking ceo which goes to show that its not nearly as common as youre making it out to be even then its completely wrong to extrapolate one just one example to generalise about millions
india,not_removed,sorry i really have no idea about recent jee trends ill have to look this up
india,not_removed,first you are wrong because your comment appears to assume that scst people today dont experience misery due to their social grouping please go to any dalit colony and have a candid chat with the people there if you are openminded enough to do so secondly if we disregard that dalits today experience no discrimination you foolishly assume that historical oppression of a group in all spheres has zero effect on ones position at present i would recommend why i am not a hindu by kancha ilaiah to fill the humongous gap in your knowledge here reservations are not a reward they are part of a system of affirmative action that has been implemented for marginalised and minority groups in many countries including the uk us and australia to lessen overall inequality between economically and socially dominant groups and nondominant
india,not_removed,firstly you may not think so but all empirical evidence points tto these programs perpuating poverty a person who does not have the neccesary intellect to get into schools reservations arent going to make that much of difference post university theyll be back to square one there are long term studies done by the hoover institute done for similar programs of affirmative action in us and south africa the evidence is quite clear secondly one does not need to be a a ceo to measure productivity its not debatable because again the empirical evidence shows that these people dont get into private sector jobs which is why the likes of jdu are trying to force reservations upon the private sector they end up in govt jobs that too due to reservation which brings down govt productivity or they go back and join the family businesses usually farming the overall effect is loss to the economy once again it has nothing to do with merit or richness it has to do with misallocation of resources which then perpetuates poverty india would be far more productive if people who had the grades were able to obtain the necessary education the reality of certain castes will only work itself out over generation but all youre doing now is perpetuating the poverty through generation by not ensuring we maximise economic productivity edit one study of of indias biggest states did look at the effect on poverty in backward groups of their getting quotas of representatives from to the reports authors aimee chin and nishith prakash say theirs is the only study ever to ask how an affirmative action policy of any sort has affected poverty in india their conclusion for scheduled tribes who are conveniently crowded near one another on electoral maps greater political clout has indeed led to a small drop in poverty but for the scheduled castes by contrast it has made absolutely no difference at all
india,not_removed,i have a question for the poster though others are welcome to answer as well while i agree with reservations for scsts and think that instead of blaming them for having it too easy leads nowhere i despise the obc reservation system it is an abhorrent misuse of reservation which favours people who frankly do not need it in many cases pawning off the responsibility of identifying obc castes has also led to further dilution of the system since state govts are more susceptible to local electoral pressures this has led to the emergence of middle castesnot dvivijaya but not outcastes either who seek to abuse the system and the creamy layer is a joke since people can easily hide parental employment detailsspeaking from personal exp even otherwise the massive quantum of reservation disenfranchise many deserving children what do you think should be the solution to this problem and how should we as a nation deal with it secondly what do you think of the large number of service castesnonproperty owning upper castes who have since ancient days relied on either royal patronage or village support for employment and consequently held little to no property such castes are being transformed into the new poor and face the extinction of their culture and traditions since neither the powerful castes of old nor the emerging castes hold any sympathy for them should the govt intervene and provide support to such castes
india,not_removed,its an old phrase on reddit an alternative version is victimhood olympics its usually said by people who disparage sjws although its popularity has now grown to such an extent that its stolen by those who were originally the target of it
india,not_removed,im out i firmly think youre trolling now i sincerely hope im right
india,not_removed,for their caste yes mostly
india,not_removed,lalu already raised it just before the bihar elections even recently nitish kumar raised the issue mayawati has no complaint in this issue because scst census is taken along with population census all the time the caste census is more about obc population not getting their share of representation in the govt
india,not_removed,of course once its released more grassroots dalit movements would crop up which would be detrimental to their political interests
india,not_removed,once dalits realise the national parties have done jack shit for them theyll stop voting for the congress and bjp even the traditional dalit friendly parties will have a hard time garnering votes local parties will crop up and further consolidate dalit votes terrible for national and even state level parties
india,not_removed,no
india,not_removed,cutoffs for obcs obcs arent usually that backward in oppurtunities they are mostly from well to do families
india,not_removed,in my limited experiencereservation system is solving problems you are talking about cutoffshere is a link of st getting admission into iimahmedabad at percentile people who scored zero and above were percentile and above let this sink iniimathat sometimes rejects even percentilers giving admission to candidate who scored negative marks
india,not_removed,when you systemically discriminate against the minority for more than years youll obviously get the majority to have better skills and seem more deserving its our job to raise that status stop being myopic and look at the bigger picture
india,not_removed,what else it might be some law which prohibits them from working hard or studying for that matter tell me who is stopping them
india,not_removed,subsidies for the people considered backward caste you mean its not subsidies for poor you mentioned that upper castes are favoured how is that there are people living in poverty if they are upper caste if your argument is true caste should not be a deciding factor in anything you seem to have innate hatred due to some reason and are dissing people without any data or knowledge
india,not_removed,i dont think you can interfere into peoples personal affairs such as whom they are marrying or how they are going about it it bothers you so much you have a choice to not read the matrimonials if implemented your way it will be a tad bit fascist
india,not_removed,lets also ban race based matrimonial ads and religion based matrimonial ads
india,not_removed,i dont see whats wrongwith you guys downvoting him he just hit the nerve is that the reason all he said was remove this reservation thing
india,not_removed,agreed
india,not_removed,so if a officer who is of an upper caste simply puts a no to a dalit applicantreservation is the solution to that
india,not_removed,let me rephrase what you said reservations never affected me therefore the opinions of other people who were affected by it are invalid see how stupid that sounds anyway if im so deluded it must be really easy to name just one such law in which the govt discriminates based on casteexcept reservations ofcourse
india,not_removed,thanks for those pearls of wisdom o wise one allow me to reciprocate op implied that im an upper caste bigot so i ended my reply by playing into that stereotype and taking it one step further damn itne detail mein explain karna padta hai logo ko its almost like you are scst too
india,not_removed,so dalits are taking unreserved seats they can if they want to no one is restricting them beyond its not like they have to be fit in the so dalits are not making it past the cut off reserved seats do go unused time after time its not news also the drop out rateafter semesterfrom the reserved catergory is massive
india,not_removed,so dalits are taking unreserved seats lets hypothetically extend this to a community x some students from x can take unreserved seats so dalits are not making it past the cut off some students from x can not take any seats in other words dalits are not making it past the cutoff yet they are qualifying as unreserved candidates schrodingers dalit no this is called stupidity
india,not_removed,kya kehna chahte ho
india,not_removed,indians do have such a great reputation of taking care of people yeah well philanthropy does happen even from the people at the very top tata gates foundation maybe if the middle class werent so burdened by tax who are actually the tax payerstds rest have their loopholes figured out they would participate in such activites i have faith in humanity and i think they can do much more than we give them credit for people do understand that an educated and well off surrounding is a benefit for them as well privileged person commenting on reddit at around pm thinks there should be no safety net safety nets have been their for a long time why hasnt it fixed the problems sometimes govt can do everything people have responsibility not govt not a prvileged person have worked really hard for where i am today
india,not_removed,laugh and from whatever anatomical orifice all you want wont change the truth
india,not_removed,there actually is an scst scholarship although i do support your point
india,not_removed,does he have a mercedes good so far ive found dalits with mercedes that makes it only million more to go you literally just said reservation is for upliftment and representation and then put a economic barrier to quantify if dalits need reservation little bit confused
india,not_removed,first of all do you know the person the tweet is about hes a freaking ceo you also said because i havent seen any dalits in a merc i am not saying its common i pointed out since you hadnt seen any such dalit
india,not_removed,you do know that general population in india is poor right if you randomly point at a person in india odds are he doesnt even own a twowheeler let alone a merc
india,not_removed,it was for im sorry
india,not_removed,dude we are talking in circles two ways to get them at par with everyone else one is reservation which has been tried for years now and as you so eloquently described has failed miserably the other is free quality education seems like we both have our minds made up about which one is the right way to go and btw i know enough about kancha to know that he is far from being neutral on this issue
india,not_removed,data of the caste census is unavailable to us but sociologists agree that reservations have broadly helped i dont think we should use sa or even us for that matter as an example i dont want to explain why as its not relevant to the discussion were having in india at least there is a broad consensus among sociologists that reservations have helped the economic productivity argument is empty rhetoric to be honest and not backed by facts
india,not_removed,once people realize voting on casteist lines has done jack shit for them then they will stop voting on casteist lines what a revelation local parties will crop up and further consolidate dalit votes i dont think thats what consolidation means
india,not_removed,st obc sts have been treated absolutely horrifyingly throughout indian history there is no reasonable way you can expect them to up their standards to match people who have had the generational luxury of education so rapidly seriously i can at least borderline understand eliminating reservations for obcs but for st thats absolutely ridiculous
india,not_removed,im yet to come across a single piece of comprehensive data in this entire thread everyone is speaking in rhetoric heres what subsidies the poor get irrespective of caste mnrega universal health insurance for all family members for ₹ a year free tuition in government schools free tuition in college along with scholarship money if theyre meritorious state specific benefits after passing class xii no income tax reduced travel costs eg train ticket subsidies ration provisions depending on the state mid day meal in schools jan dhan etc none of these are dependent on caste and are provided by the state to alleviate their suffering as much as possible more needs to be done though i agree
india,not_removed,right so arranged marriage based on caste is about personal choice pass me the weed sir
india,not_removed,he says remove reservation because caste discrimination does not exist and proceeds to shit talk scsts
india,not_removed,hahaha save your stupidity for your fellow narrowminded friends you do indeed appear to be a bigot however i wont make assumptions regarding your caste because i dont believe in ascribing characteristics to people based on stereotypes of ones caste whether that is done to an upper caste or a dalit is equally wrong
india,not_removed,s
india,not_removed,but theyre not taking the seats are they were talking about a hypothetical situation if you dont qualify as a general candidate dont blame dalits blame your lack of scholarship dalits arent taking general seats they are barely making past the cutoff
india,not_removed,name the community and show me what percentage of that community is qualifying as general candidate ive done a casual analysis which is why i wont quote it here the percentage is well below so general castes still have at least seats to themselves when they form of the population
india,not_removed,rich people going for coaching abuse
india,not_removed,in the college i studied in no sc st students were eligible for scholarships all upper caste students got them any idea what this scholarship is called i looked it up and couldnt find it
india,not_removed,i didnt i was responding to an absurd point which seemed to indicate that all dalits abused reservations as they came to coaching classes in mercedes of course economic criteria isnt relevant but i was trying to make a different point in our country lower caste communities and poverty overlap significantly
india,not_removed,that wasnt my point have you seen that ceo the tweet is about if not even you havent seen a dalit in a merc
india,not_removed,dude youre talking about physically challenged sc sts sorry i cant argue against their case this country treats its physically challenged people like street dogs
india,not_removed,i find your arrogance quite hilarious you speak of empty rhetoric and yet your entire reply has been an aberration you merely dismiss data your argument are superficial and dismissive the idea that two sub set groups who have similarreltative economic and intellectual standing within two communities cannot be compared is ignorant to say the least well the evidence clearly shows and ive explained why you can choose to ignore the facts ive given you and thats your prerogative
india,not_removed,yes yes everything you dont like can be disregarded coz thats how logic works
india,not_removed,its because weve gotten at least a generation head start so after having generations of reservations should the beneficiaries of such facilities give up their privilege it becomes a privilege if some are getting benefits continuously while the rest arent institutional discrimination they have legal paths that they can explore if they feel they have been wrongly discriminated against otherwise using blanket terms such as institutional discrimination isnt really helping out give me a case where this happened and i guarantee you there is a law which can protect them against unjust oppression
india,not_removed,everyone is speaking in rhetoric says the guywho supports unequality
india,not_removed,so do you deliberately want to make people marry to other castes even if they dont want to how about respecting peoples personal choices marriage certainly is a very personal affair i wont cast judgement at someone who is marrying outside of their faith even though according to some religious texts it deems such a congress null and void or caste its their personal choice you and i have no right to intervene in that
india,not_removed,it literally is the personal choice may be stupid as balls but it still is a personal choice
india,not_removed,reserved seats go unused which could clearly be given to students who didnt made beyond the general cuttoff but have still scored massively more than the students in the reserved category not hypothetical happened to me happens every year
india,not_removed,name the community and show me what percentage of that community is qualifying as general candidate i am not debating whether it is or im pointing out that your logic was not correct in your schrodingers dalit example
india,not_removed,general castes still have at least seats to themselves when they form of the population so what that still has many who couldnt fit into the seats to prevent the wastage why not give it to next highest scorer
india,not_removed,edited the original post for clarity
india,not_removed,and yeah lets leave peoples lives up to your faith in humanity cause govt does such a bang up job of it why even bother intervening into it i have faith that people are generally by far in majority are reasonable and they do engage in charitable activities weather you like it or not depending on govt handouts doesnt sound very logical as govt cant be everywhere people can and they feel empathy they can be persuaded to help most countries in europe where poverty education etc arent such major issues have tax rates that go to scandinavia has europe does have a more socialist structure and in some cases it has worked out wonderfully but you wont add eastern european countries to that list would you nordic countries which have the lowest population and highest tax return per capita works out cause well they have low population these state based welfare facility begins to fail as the state reaches a certain critical mass namely due to improper distribution from the centre due to lack of vision or just incompetence or corruption or all of the above honestly we should be taxed even more but with one caveat the money needs to be spent properly theres absolutely no problem with the tax rate itself aha and there you are with your ifs and buts but see people arent perfect and govt isnt some idealzenlikemonks who have no greed or malice at their hearts they have their problems with corruption and incompetence if you went to school werent really worried about meals a day and always knew you were going to go to some college not necessarily an amazing one all of this is true and i wont apologize for it however wasnt sure about college had to work hard for getting into a decent college rest the meals every parent should be able to provide for their children otherwise procreating and making babies shouldnt be their topmost priority stop being an elitist i am none of the sort i just believe you work hard for it and you get it what you deserve no more no less either work to take care of people i have taught at schools for underprivileged students in my college days in my office we have many csr events where i volunteer for teaching see cause i believe education is very powerful tool govt cant be everywhere and centralised control of resources is very inefficient people are more likely to help out
india,not_removed,dude youre talking about physically challenged sc sts if they are so physically challenged that they can qualify mains just by handing over the answer sheet blank there is definitely an argument against their case
india,not_removed,social and economic status definitely have a bearing on how likely a person is to succeed i just dont believe in handing out benefits without them working for it provide them with the facilities and the tools theyre capable enough to do it themselves
india,not_removed,i totally agree with you my comment was empty rhetoric thats because there is no data on the caste census we should release that so that we can deal with specifics
india,not_removed,facts with data then please since youre so logical
india,not_removed,when youre impoverished i was talking about reservations and representations of certain underprivileged not poverty poverty is a very real problem no one is denying it their isnt much you can do to a family which is impoverished right now and cant feed themselves by guaranteeing them seat in college

india,not_removed,what i want to know if this was a log or just a big branch
india,not_removed,wtf is happening in tn
india,not_removed,a normal day in tamil nadu gunda raj
india,not_removed,the assistant professor tried to intervene and got his ass handed to him picture him as a thug instead of just an idiot
india,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikibystandereffect
india,not_removed,typical choice of murder weapon for a student of civil engineering story time
india,not_removed,this has been happening everywhere in the world few days ago similar reports came from delhi and ap
india,not_removed,jungle raj is the preferred term
india,not_removed,neither gunda nor raj here
india,not_removed,lungi raj
india,not_removed,thats because he went against him alone a group of people can easily overpower a man with a wooden log
india,not_removed,the weapon in this case is a log thats shaped like a beam civil engineering involves study of beams
india,not_removed,theoretically yes deciding factors how good does the man handle his log how many pussies were present in the class
india,not_removed,even pussies could throw stonesbookschairs at him
india,not_removed,how many pussies were present in the class you are implying that someone with a a pussy cant handle itself and is in need of others that without a pussy to protect it thats incredibly sexist thing to say and you are perpetrating patriarchy by saying so s
india,not_removed,implying easy availability of stones in a class room
india,not_removed,this happened in a classroom in tamil nadu not in up assembly or downtown srinagar
india,not_removed,viva la patriarchy
india,not_removed,why the s implying that being a woman automatically makes you a coward is something to be proud of nowdays thats like australian rednecks going around implying that being aborigines automatically makes you lazy or american rednecks implying thst being indian automatically makes you a drunkard
india,not_removed,implyingnonselfish nature of the crowd
india,not_removed,clear lack of stones among the students
india,not_removed,people these days are swarming over each other to show how unabashedly brave politicallyincorrect nonconformists they are that s after incredibly stupid sentence makes me want to throw a flower pot at them
india,not_removed,when people dont pay heed to dying accident victims what makes you think theyd pick a fight with a murderer
india,not_removed,it is justified it is a legal contract that anything filmed in india must be submitted to government before publishing and they violeted the rules if you agree to some terms and condition then you must honour it so in this case i fully support the decision they did this again httpkazirangaassamgovinwpantipoachingmanagement poachers are mostly poor poeople they will kill a tiger or endangerd animal for some money if they know that worse that can happen to them is few years in jail sometimes the price is worth the time but if they know that if they are found inside the park poaching they will be shot it will work and it has worked wonderfully fear is what keeps the crime away
india,not_removed,its the bbc banned only in tiger reserves banned only for years banned for not following the rules my god you lot will cry over anything
india,not_removed,ntca said bbc had failed to submit the documentary to moefcc and ministry of external affairs for obligatory previewing i think its fair on ntcas part to ask for a preview of bbcs documentary the question whether bbc edits out the undesired part or not per their suggestion follows later if bbc is free to refuse any preview ntca has every right from banning bbc from filming in the reserves and its not like we do not know how much love bbc has for india
india,not_removed,stung by a bbc documentary questioning indias aggressive protection measures at kaziranga national park in assam the national tiger conservation authority that governs all tiger reserves in the country has imposed a ban on the network and its journalist justin rowlatt for five years nagpur stung by a bbc documentary questioning indias aggressive protection measures at kaziranga national park in assam the national tiger conservation authority ntca that governs all tiger reserves in the country has imposed a ban on the network and its journalist justin rowlatt for five yearsas reported by toi on february bbcs south asia correspondent justin rowlatts documentary titled one world killing for conservation on kazirangas rhino conservation methods came in for sharp criticism from the union environment ministry for being grossly erroneous the documentary had claimed forest guards in kaziranga had been given powers to shoot and kill anyone they think was a threat to rhinosin a memorandum issued on monday evening ntca said bbc had failed to submit the documentary to moefcc and ministry of external affairs for obligatory previewing in order to remove any deviations so as to achieve a balanced and accurate exposition of the themeit has asked chief wildlife wardens of all tiger range states and field directors of tiger reserves to disallow filming permission to bbc for five years here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,justin rowlatt the irony
india,not_removed,bbcs south asia correspondent justin rowlatts documentary titled one world killing for conservation on kazirangas rhino conservation methods came in for sharp criticism from the union environment ministry for being grossly erroneous is it grossly erroneous though
india,not_removed,there is no freedom of speech issue here poachers in kaziranga are openly hostile and threaten safety of the rangers as well
india,not_removed,bbc deserved it
india,not_removed,rowlatt irony over
india,not_removed,well trump calls then fake news as well
india,not_removed,in a memorandum issued on monday evening ntca said bbc had failed to submit the documentary to moefcc and ministry of external affairs for obligatory previewing in order to remove any deviations so as to achieve a balanced and accurate exposition of the theme aka unfreedom of the press
india,not_removed,good neonazi racist bigots like bbc should be banned all across india not just national parks
india,not_removed,good indian govt should show these foreign media their place
india,not_removed,why didnt they submit the damn reel if it was obligatory having said that we all should wait for bbcs version of the story i dont think a big corp like it would deliberately bypass the law let both sides make their cases
india,not_removed,lauh lauh everywhere
india,not_removed,it is justified it is a legal contract that anything filmed in india must be submitted to government before publishing and they violeted the rules do you find it also justified that the moefcc and mea asks for an obligatory previewing in order to remove any deviations so as to achieve a balanced and accurate exposition of the theme
india,not_removed,im appalled at the reasoning which is given here poaching is done by mostly poor they will be shot it will work it has worked theres something called rule of law and substantive law better you should know
india,not_removed,tfw no planet earth iii shot in india
india,not_removed,why should bbc love or hate any country their job is objective journalism not sucking up to anyone
india,not_removed,the rowlatt act of gave the government enormous amounts of power and enabled them to arrest anyone as a prisoner for upto years without trials gandhiji launched a satyagrah against it one of the first leading to many arrests and strikes and martial law being enforced this also lead to the infamous shootings in jallianwala bagh on by general dyer i had my sst exam yesterday lol and this q didnt come fml
india,not_removed,reverse colonialism
india,not_removed,there is no freedom of speech issue here bbc is not allowed to report on the happenings in whatever manner they wish thus they do not have the freedom to express their reportage
india,not_removed,if it was unfreedom you wouldnt have even heard about itthe point what i said below bbc is not indian news channel as much it is important that they show real india not their biased news in case they hold any grudge against as many of british media does and some reporters of of nytimes too
india,not_removed,edgy but ultimately uninformed and stupid comment from someone who didnt read the article and therefore missed the point
india,not_removed,they want only their version of truth to be reported
india,not_removed,the fun part is day inout these very same people will cry about freedom of speech that too in places where it does not apply now when the boot is on the other foot we see a clamp down in free speech its pretty clear how much the government supports free speech
india,not_removed,not too familiar with the bbc but my impression of it was that it is a pretty fair presenter of news could you clarify what you mean please
india,not_removed,disgusting ideology stop feeling so victimised always if indian media reports on the govt they are anti national if foreign media does something they are making an anti india propaganda
india,not_removed,yes it is justified these are the laws of the land and bbc should follow them if you have a problem i would suggest you find a way to get the law changed
india,not_removed,bbc is not indian news channel as much it is important that they show real india not their biased news in case they hold any grudge against as many of british media does and some reporters of of nytimes too i fully support this decision too
india,not_removed,theres something called rule of law and substantive law the government makes the laws in case you forgot that they gave the parks the power to kill poachers on sight edit and those poachers themselves are armed to teeth they dont spare rangers so why should rangers spare the poachers gun every last one of them down
india,not_removed,while ppl sit around discussing morality and legality those poor ppl will keep shooting at tigersrhinos of which we have limited and dwindling supply in this case save tigersrhinos or save poor pplpick one
india,not_removed,yeah bbc is the epitome of unbiased journalism when it comes to india s
india,not_removed,every news outlet including the bbc has their biases and the way they show their reports can affect public opinion you should
india,not_removed,because colonialism and british propaganda
india,not_removed,bbc reports its news like it does in any other country indians for their lack of selfconfidence are always paranoid when it comes to foreign media if india is not shown as lala land their self confidence will take a beating and start whining they still think bbc indulges in british propaganda most british people are not even aware of the erstwhile colonies only god knows to whom the propaganda is for dont show lack of toilets dont show rapes dont show shit in the streets educated indians the harsh truth is white journos can easily get access to anything in india if anything blame the indians but they know they cant change indians so they just vent in frustration as if there is a conspiracy against india
india,not_removed,whats their rationale from holding back for a preview
india,not_removed,well at least your study gains you some karma
india,not_removed,they are supposed to be a reliable source of information they are supposed to be free and fair when they disseminate the information saying that they report whatever they want to and however they want to is not done there has to be some sort of accountability in whatever they report
india,not_removed,whatever manner they wish why should they be allowed to report in whatever manner they wish
india,not_removed,bbc is not indian news channel as much it is important that they show real india not their biased news in case they hold any grudge against as many of british media does and some reporters of of nytimes too ah unfreedom of the foreign press got it
india,not_removed,so tell us what the point is the suspense is too much couldnt find it after rereading the article
india,not_removed,how come if ntca wants parts of the video to be edited it doesnt mean bbc has to comply they can still go ahead and release it the first question would be what problem does bbc have in offering a preview
india,not_removed,yup
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,disgusting ideology stop feeling so victimised always no it isnt disgusting west has always used propaganda like against russia and syria we must start our own propaganda machine and counter it also we must ban it if foreign media does something they are making an anti india propaganda yes they are if indian media reports on the govt they are anti national nobody said that for criticism of govt
india,not_removed,why do you find the law justified
india,not_removed,how do people know the law must change without exposure to the hidden bits of footage it would seem they are getting all the info but are getting only the government approved part isnt that a mild version of what kim jong un does
india,not_removed,i asked a different question i did not ask if you support the decision
india,not_removed,yeah but it doesnt arm any tom dick and harry with guns and go on a rampage with their pistols they come with responsibility and accountability
india,not_removed,bbc reports the rapes human trafficking lack of toilets so it is biased against india
india,not_removed,balls their reporting on india is of buzzfeeds standards you are the one lacking self confidence if you think there is nothing to report on india except rapes and toilets and as ive mentioned elsewhere bbc has a knack of reporting the most inconsequential news about india that only perpetuates stereotypes
india,not_removed,they are supposed to be free and fair when they disseminate the information saying that they report whatever they want to and however they want to is not done so government should decide whether the media is free and fair revolutionary idea
india,not_removed,they are supposed to be a reliable source of information to their viewers and taxpayers maybe not to the subjects of their reportage also neutrality and bias are subjective unless one is spreading straight out lies a state agency imo is unqualified to be an arbiter of bias especially when the reports are on its actions
india,not_removed,also you must agree here that regardless of whether they should be allowed to say x or not freedom of speech definitely encompasses this issue which was my point in the comment above
india,not_removed,that is exactly what freedom of expression means
india,not_removed,you need to read before you talk do you even know how british news people showed indias success of satelites volsted gridban send up all the rockets you want you still dont have a pot to pss into end your poverty first gobshyte why all the fuss its easy to put a satellite into space i mean its hardly rocket science is it matt daley no money to carry on the struggle against public defecation cholera starvation and endemic street begging then ah well nice to see india has its priorites right once again
india,not_removed,if the ntca feels wronged they can give their official version in any form they desire thats how countries with freedom of speech are supposed to function banning a news organisation is unacceptable for a government run organisation if a private company like a hotel had done this in response to unfair coverage by bbc no one would have a problem a government body is supposed to run for the people and it cant discriminate against those it doesnt agree with
india,not_removed,west has always used propaganda like against russia and syria we must start our own propaganda machine and counter it also we must ban it russia has also used propoganda against its enemies and so has every country in existence including india western propaganda is just more successful because they are more powerful and have been for a while
india,not_removed,nobody said that for criticism of govt modi did accuse his critics of being antinational during the demonetisation fiasco this is likely what was being referred to
india,not_removed,if foreign media does something they are making an anti india propaganda yes they are lel
india,not_removed,also we must ban it and the birth of a trump
india,not_removed,a law is a law you cannot argue with that i do not find the income tax law justified the fact that i pay of my income and get no special treatment i find that unjustified but there is nothing i can do about it i follow it because that is what has to be done as a citizen i also do not agree with all aspects of the reservation laws why should devyani khobragade enjoy reservation when her father was already serving as an ias officer i feel that is unfair but again i have to grudgingly overlook it and move on with my life
india,not_removed,i guess i have to post it here too volsted gridban send up all the rockets you want you still dont have a pot to pss into end your poverty first gobshyte why all the fuss its easy to put a satellite into space i mean its hardly rocket science is it matt daley no money to carry on the struggle against public defecation cholera starvation and endemic street begging then ah well nice to see india has its priorites right once again i am not saying they all hate india but plenty dislike as india became better economy then them in just years even after it was under british rule for so long they took as much they could
india,not_removed,they are not arming any tom dick and harry they are arming rangers
india,not_removed,but it doesnt arm any tom dick and harry with guns this aint us bruh where every tom dick and harry will have a gun on him
india,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiantiindiansentimentbbc bbc has a long tradition of indophobia back in they were thrown out for their pro pak reporting never forget the fuckers called mumbai terrorists gunmen edit copying a comment from worldnews thread bbc the organization that launched a crusade for their documentary on rape in india and kept curiously silent on their own bbc pedophile employees including jimmy savile stuart hall and rolf harris raping children my middle finger salutes that pedophile corporation
india,not_removed,oh enough of this bullshit you cant read the india column of bbc and still say its not biased they publish nothing of any relevance or importance to policy economics current affairs etc example i remember when coldplay had that video in india released which everyone quite liked except that some random african americans called in cultural appropriation all of a sudden the bbc publishes a massive article about indian intolerance with no links or proof of any outrage except the tweets from some black people in america another example some random fringe hindu group does a puja for trump all of a sudden an article about how all hindus love trump no mention of how small that group of idiots was bbc is at buzzfeed levels when it comes to indian news
india,not_removed,that holds for every countrys media when it comes to foreign news why would someone in usuk care about positive indian news and why would someone in india care about positive news from usuk hence you have media perpetuating stereotypes out of indifference and ignorance the accusation of malice requires more proof than just that they hate us why do you think that the only us news you hear in india is about kids shooting up schools police executing blacks indians facing discrimination etc the only news from the entire middle east is just suicide bombings and armed insurgencies a huge part of the world practically doesnt exist for indian media the sentiment in uk about india is a different issue entirelythe bbcs attitude is no different from any other publication from that country and is representative of the country as a whole
india,not_removed,how can they present an unbiased report to their viewers without being unbiased to the subjects of their reportage a bias is clearly a bias if you can prove it there is nothing subjective about it misinforming their viewers is also a very objective sign of a bias whether you like it or not a media outlet with a clear bias is an extremely dangerous entity because they are able to shape public opinion for or against someone or something
india,not_removed,nope freedom of expression doesnt mean you get to tell lies disguised as half truths and get away with it
india,not_removed,and we have zee news whats your point are you saying that because media allows likes of sambhit patra to show up and shit all over the show the shows should be banned do you not see a difference between opinioncommentary shows and newsdocumentary
india,not_removed,there are no real people named volsted gridban gobshyte and matt daley talking shit about the mission infact most international media including the british ones were pretty impressed by the feat
india,not_removed,theyre not being banned entirely from india only from the reserves i do not understand how is this an attack on freedom of speech
india,not_removed,so has every country in existence including india nope india has zero international media presence do not create false notions
india,not_removed,you seem to forget that trump has been voted president
india,not_removed,dont just make stuff up as you go along the issue is not about rangers identities heres the park director himself the bbc documentary has grossly misrepresented facts i thought the bbc possessed some kind of credit worthiness but i am afraid i am extremely disappointed about how they have deliberately distorted details i must strongly emphasise that we do not follow a shoot at sight policy our forest rangers have been provided immunity in the use of firearms under the code of criminal procedure section given the circumstances under which they are working especially with the rise of militancy in the north east they need to be given immunity but this is not the same as stating they are following a shoot at sight policy heres the original bbc article which actually covers everything he said and is pretty balanced
india,not_removed,the subsection of the law cited does not mention anything about identities of forest guards and rangers
india,not_removed,if they want identities removed they can sue if they see that not being done advanced viewing is repressive
india,not_removed,the ntca has the authority to enforce an entry ban on anyone it wishes that doesnt make it the law for example if they decided that people of a certain caste or religion cant enter that would be unconstitutional not everything is explicitly written down now whether the ntca banning a news organisation is ok is where people can differ while i dont think this particular incident is that big of a deal it is my opinion that a government run body should not be favouring or discriminating against any person or organisation just because they dont agree with them it goes against a very fundamental principle of the constitution
india,not_removed,i am free no matter what rules surround me if i find them tolerable i tolerate them if i find them too obnoxious i break them i am free because i know that i alone am morally responsible for everything i do ― robert a heinlein
india,not_removed,a law is a law you cannot argue with that i asking your opinion on why you find this law justified
india,not_removed,are you seriously posting three random comments from a newpaper article to try to claim bias of british media or general sentiment of the population there this is not the way to go about substantiating your arguments
india,not_removed,never forget the fuckers called mumbai terrorists gunmen and they did the same for hebdo shooting and paris attacks bbc have repeatedly explained this policy where they will not use the word terrorist unless they are quoting someone
india,not_removed,they also called london terrorists bombers what is your point
india,not_removed,most american media too supported pakistan didnt one american president call indira a cold fox or bitch may be india is not so justified put your justice boner to rest there is nothing black and white about india either lol
india,not_removed,that holds for every countrys media when it comes to foreign news sorry not true ive lived in the uk germany turkey and south africa the latter do report relevant political or policy news about india and the third world a lot of publications in the uk do as well such as the guardian and telegraph although with some bias but the bbc is pure buzzfeed level reporting
india,not_removed,how can they present an unbiased report to their viewers without being unbiased to the subjects of their reportage that is not what i meant at all i meant that they dont owe anything to their reportees only to their viewers as they are the consumers a bias is clearly a bias if you can prove it there is nothing subjective about it you really are oversimplifying how easy it is to spot bias whether you like it or not a media outlet with a clear bias is an extremely dangerous entity because they are able to shape public opinion for or against someone or something entirely dependent on how much trust viewers place in it which is built up by a history of accuracy
india,not_removed,depends on what you mean by get away with it if you mean legal consequences then this is exactly what foe means its literally there in the name freedom to express which means anyone has the freedom to express anything if any of those two are restrictedie not everyone can express or certain expressions are banned then freedom of expression is curtailed which is as good as it being nonexistent
india,not_removed,who decides who is lying
india,not_removed,i dont support biased media thats the point i am making while indian channels no matter how bad things they show they wont show anything that hurts the reputation of your country and the understand the country from inside while international media comes judge us without understanding the situation i have many friends who think the moment they set foot in india outside of aeroplane they will be raped and get millions diseases because thats what they have been shown on the news
india,not_removed,yes they are only being banned from the reserves and i never claimed or implied that they were being banned from india i also wouldnt say this is an attack on freedom of speech because it sounds overly dramatic this is just a sarkari department pissed about what they feel is unfair coverage this would be like ioa banning certain news channels from sports events because they exposed the cwg scam which technically is still in court so they would have the right to do that according to the logic in this thread this would be like the coal ministry banning reporters that reported on the coal scam again still in court a free and adversarial press is necessary in a democracy it is not the governments job to decide who is speaking the truth
india,not_removed,india has zero international media presence not for lack of trying
india,not_removed,that article has nothing about kaziranga
india,not_removed,dont just make stuff up as you go along the issue is not about rangers identities oh it is not someone has already equated this to military technology btw
india,not_removed,well authority was not handed down to them by their forefathers but granted by an actstatute and in this case the ncta or whatever has acted within their capacity which sounds good to me
india,not_removed,go ahead try bringing that up the next time you get a tax notice
india,not_removed,kya chutiyapanti hai he is saying that it doesnt matter if the law is justified or not but as it is the law everyone within the ambit of the law should follow it
india,not_removed,sure at least i have some proof to show my point and its not just british media even many journalist in usa are too biased to example httpstwittercomellenbarrynyt look at her timeline and posts about india i have many friends who think the moment they set foot in india outside of airport they will be raped and get millions diseases because thats what they have been shown on the news i am not saying all the population but dont tell me they are not biased because you have some political agenda
india,not_removed,sadly thats what the defense of this government has come down to
india,not_removed,they do doesnt mean i support them the motivation of those gunmen was terrorism they should be mentioned as terrorists period
india,not_removed,none of them are as bad as bbc
india,not_removed,if they owe it to their viewers to be unbiased then they should be unbiased to their viewers as a viewer i can demand them to be unbiased and if i can objectively determine that they are pushing their biases as news then i can demand that they be punished spotting obvious biases is not that difficult if everytime they publish only one side of the report and deliberately mislead their viewers by not publishing stuff that can undermine their biases then there is a bias in the report that was exactly what happened with the kaziranga poachers shoot at sight report also this is not the first time the bbc did this
india,not_removed,should a doctor have the right to express whatever medical advice he wants to to his patients all professions come with some standards of conduct and i dont see why journalism should be any different you can write opeds expressing anything you want all day long i dont care but if you claim that you are reporting news that has to come with responsibilities and regulations
india,not_removed,wont show anything that hurts the reputation of your country holy fucking shitballs have you seen the saas bahu serials theres no reputation left worth talking of oh you want to talk news channels what about all the manufactured shit that you see on zee and regional channels or the shouting idiot who gives everyone cancer whos been thankfully quiet while he sets up his new shop you need to change your friends i have friends whove come in and gone gallivanting around rural india without any prior planning and not for their lack of having read news about india in fact it was just the opposite but neither your nor my anecdotes matter theres no evidence for your rconspiracy level accusations of western media doing nother but show india in terrible light youll always have occassional terriblebiased journalists everywhere but the world is not out to get you
india,not_removed,i dont support biased media thats the point i am making which media is unbiased according to you
india,not_removed,dd has tried to enter the international market
india,not_removed,oh sorry here it is
india,not_removed,and now youre shifting the goalposts nice try this is the reason cited by the mea and moeffc in order to remove any deviations so as to achieve a balanced and accurate exposition of the theme what part of this protects the identities of guards
india,not_removed,lol and now youre shifting the goalposts i get the feeling here that you are in order to remove any deviations so as to achieve a balanced and accurate exposition of the theme has nothing to do with identities of guardsrangers the law allows the forest department to review footage you asked for justification for the law and got one possibility that does not justify the law at all its like saying rape happens so lets chop everyones genitals off the law should have clearly mentioned then that the identity of guards and rangers should be hidden in footage explain why you think a law needs to enumerate every conceivable future reason why it may be invoked again thats not whats being asked for at all instead that the law should restrict only undesirable events and not some superset of them giving state officials the discretionary power to decide whether a certain case is undesirable
india,not_removed,its not supposed to know it can draft up a contract that a news outlet wont disclose identities if one party violates that contract the justice system can deal with it goi insisting that they will vet the product changes the paradigm from a contractbased society to an authoritarian society i agree with you that as long as the law exists bbc must follow it but i think the law and contract is draconian
india,not_removed,thats why you make sure your income is hidden break the rules yes but break it with some brain power
india,not_removed,and i am asking why is this law justified
india,not_removed,look at her timeline and posts about india seems to be mostly retweets about trump and the kansas shooting
india,not_removed,this government havent you seen the top level comment they broke rules thats why they got banned
india,not_removed,if you think the bbc are some sort of a holy diety that preaches good then you are havin a laugh i can say this for any entity on earth including you and the government
india,not_removed,you used mumbai as an example to show why bbc was antiindia i just showed you that your example was wrong and therefore you are biased against bbc given your line of argument and support you should first send all your comments to the bbc social media pr team to ensure balanced perspective
india,not_removed,should a doctor have the right to express whatever medical advice he wants to to his patients no their contract and the hippocratic oath places restrictions on what a doctor can say to their patients and i dont see why journalism should be any different how do you define a professional journalist though this is not a protected profession but if you claim that you are reporting news that has to come with responsibilities and regulations or how about reputations are built by media houses and people choose what to trust instead of govt asking as a nanny
india,not_removed,i never said world is out to get us but there are plenty of them biased i have showed you some examples you are not still getting the point i am trying to make i am not saying indian media clean or anything but foreign medias views on india needs to be watched i been reading western news for like years now
india,not_removed,reddit
india,not_removed,they have tried a few times but im not sure how serious they were about it at least in official reports they were talking of creating a brand rivaling bbc cnn etc you can search for it by sam pitroda committee prasar bharti but tv channels arent the only means of propagating your countrys views
india,not_removed,that has been answered countless times in the thread one of them is to protect the identity of the rangers
india,not_removed,well i never claimed to be unbiased plus you havent read the other links i posted
india,not_removed,how do you define a professional journalist though anybody who gets to write a news article opeds mein jo mutravisarjan karna hai kar lo news should be informative this is not a protected profession i know but i wish that it was or how about reputations are built by media houses and people choose what to trust instead of govt asking as a nanny except that this is just not working
india,not_removed,i been reading western news for like years now lets talk numbers what proportion of reports about india that you saw in bbc were unfairly negative edit heres todays bbc india page for reference i dont see a single unfairly negative news here do you
india,not_removed,i heard on reddit yesterday that nehru was responsible for people in india not being able to open a restaurant in
india,not_removed,but they have skipped the legal process process altogether which imo shows bad faith on their part i never denied this
india,not_removed,so removal of identities would provide balance and accuracy of the exposition
india,not_removed,and this has been implied many times that the law is broad in this particular case the government has not cited the identities of rangers as a reason of an issue with the documentary the reason cited implies that bbc is critical of the current status and the government wants to have an approval for things which are critical of government agencies
india,not_removed,i never said you were unbiased either now because you accept that you are biased every comment you make about bbc will first have to be approved by the bbc social media team
india,not_removed,anybody who gets to write a news article what about bloggers with ad monetisation and patreon i know but i wish that it was and how would you regulate entry into this profession how would you gauge bias and slant which can be incredibly subtle and complex the practice of medicine otoh can be gauged objectively also the consumerscustomers of journalism are not the reportees but the readersaudience it is to them they owe objectivityetc not the reportees
india,not_removed,well he was not perfect guy his many mistakes might have lead to some butterfly effect unless i understand what it was about i wouldnt comment and remember anything is possible
india,not_removed,well he was not perfect guy his many mistakes and remember anything is possible

india,not_removed,bheem vs hulk karn vs hawkeye bhokaal vs heman doga vs deadpool naagraaj vs snakeeyes indrajeet vs trickster ravan vs the joker kali vs black widow shiv vs superman heracles vs bheem vs hulk adding greek mythology now poseidon vs shiv vs superman hades vs ravan vs magneto helios ram vs storm harley okay enough fantasy for today ill stop now
india,not_removed,this reminds me of a quora answer sometimes there are gems lurking there forget superman bring in the whole justice league avengers thanos with infinity gauntlet galactus etc and still together they wont be able to beat hanuman in a hypothetical battle here is why everyone knows hanuman is immortal but remember this line from hanuman chalisa ashta siddhi nava nidhi ke data meaning he has control and possession of siddhis and nidhis what are these siddhis and nidhis the siddhis are aṇimā ability to reduce ones size mahima ability to increase ones size garima ability to increase ones weight infinitely laghima ability to become lighter than the lightest prāpti ability to obtain anything prākāmya ability to acquire anything desired iṣiṭva lordship over creation vaśitva having control over things similarly nidhis are different treasures the siddhis which are just part of the many great feats and traits hanuman is described of in hindu literature with the help of these siddhis even thanos with his infinity gauntlet will lose within seconds as hanuman can easily acquire anything he desired with prākāmya he dont even need to fight in order to win he can easily control his environment in his favor or just can sit down at a place forever until superman or anyone as a matter of a fact gets tired with his efforts on giving a blow to hanuman he did the same with bhima for defeating his arrogance hanuman survived bramhastra from indrajit without using a counter weapon only godly weapons like bramhastra sudarshan shivas trident can counter bramhastra ie only weapons of bramha vishnu and mahesh shiva can counter bramhastra and hanuman survived it without any weapons he is the incarnation of none other than shiva himself hes the favorite of lord rama krishna vishnu
india,not_removed,only if they fight in india spiderman getting entangled in street electricity wire mesh batman will get stuck in traffic you can also find some kryptonite from chor baazar for superman magneto will probably end up owning biggest kabadi shop from stolen iron all other xmen will be fighting against khap panchayat which they will surely loose because of their minority status
india,not_removed,youre the man hanuman
india,not_removed,i have started reading works of devdutt pattanaik the stories from indian myths are much better than anything marveldc can come up with well marveldc ace hindu myths in visual representation marketing though
india,not_removed,saitamaall
india,not_removed,graphic india has had a very tumultuous past they started off as virgin comics then became liquid comics and went quiet for a while then finally came back as graphic india they have a nice team right now and have been regular in their releases and even though the quality of their books is not great the story and art makes up for it they even got stan lee on board for a childrens project grant morrison was one of the creators for days too so its a pretty strong company they just need to focus on upping the quality of their books its really sad how their books have quality issues when they can afford stan lee and grant morrison one of my favorite indian comic book publishers right now
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,hanuman can defeat most superheroes he got so big that he swallowed the fucking sun the sun that is fucking huge but it is unlikely he is real because who the fuck gets hit in space near the sun and falls on earth that thing defies gravity but as fights go hanuman will own most superheroes edit off topic
india,not_removed,take this question to rwhowouldwin
india,not_removed,off topic but i think theres a higher chance than marvel might cater more into chinese mythology rather than hindu mythology purely from a standpoint
india,not_removed,no because using them in comics is bound to offend some peoples religious beliefs
india,not_removed,superheroes dont exist and whether or not ours can beat theirs just depends on the writer
india,not_removed,well at least people are admitting they are myths
india,not_removed,raj comics is indian mythology now

india,not_removed,add zeus vs indra please
india,not_removed,shouldnt it be arjuna vs hawkeye
india,not_removed,bro please it should be hanuman vs hulk
india,not_removed,as far as i know kali is actually the goddess of time and shiva well everyone knows you dont fuck with him so these two dont have any match probably
india,not_removed,joker vs shakuni

india,not_removed,hanuman is op as fuck
india,not_removed,laghima now i know where guru lahima in avatar comes from
india,not_removed,wait so couldnt he just desire sita and get her back bc ramayana karne ki kya zarurat thi
india,not_removed,laghima ability to become lighter than the lightest how would you do this aint this a paradox
india,not_removed,take my upvote and go forth
india,not_removed,lol
india,not_removed,have you read jaya
india,not_removed,exactly there are so many backstories for every one and everything and they make a lot more sense than marvels or dc mahabharata alone is such a fascinating story fiction or true story doesnt matter even still the older dd mahabharata series is still good to watch if you excuse the special effects
india,not_removed,you sartake my upvote
india,not_removed,the lord of memes creator of dankness
india,not_removed,sensei
india,not_removed,pretty sure guys like thanos silver surfer morg galactus could defeat him
india,not_removed,its more of offending people than money though if you make comics featuring hindu deitiessomeone somewhere will make a ruckus for the ban citing insult to their religion
india,not_removed,atleast he didnt say shaktimaan
india,not_removed,if people start idolizing naagraaj start making his temples and pray two times a day there well reach to its mythology state in about years so yes
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,brainiac
india,not_removed,sherlock holmes
india,not_removed,no karna and even eklavya were always better than arjun at archery
india,not_removed,enter the void
india,not_removed,aise toh if sri ram was vishnu avatar why didnt he just tell kekayi to go fuck herself its called the script everyone has to follow it to make an epic
india,not_removed,wasnt ravan as much or even mightier than ram if so i guess it wont be that easy plus i guess you cant get humans more like things he desires
india,not_removed,hanuman could easily have gotten sita vishnu himself could also have descended to bring her back hanumans mother actually chastises him for not saving rama the trouble and bringing back sita himself however the concept of dharma is one of the main themes of the epics basically certain tasks fall upon the shoulders of certain individuals and therefore it was the duty of rama to bring sita back read up on your epics before you start commenting
india,not_removed,you keep decreasing in density like ant man when his belt breaks
india,not_removed,i used the quote tag thats how
india,not_removed,nopes hanuman is indestructible all these marvel characters cant do much against him together hanuman would pawn them all if he really wants to but he is chill
india,not_removed,yup thats why i used most and not all cosmic powered entities and reality manipulation is on a whole another level super man prime one million one above all beyonder dr manhattan etc are crazy powerful what i am saying is that the size of hanuman is a huge factor our sun is huge and if hanuman can have his mouth as big as the sun then even galactus would look like a tiny dot of sand to him wouldnt protect him from cosmic power though
india,not_removed,bizarro vs shaktimaan
india,not_removed,i dont know if you are joking or not but there is a good possibility of that happening
india,not_removed,yes but does brainiac have saboo
india,not_removed,but pandavas avengers
india,not_removed,become wind
india,not_removed,rama was vishnus avatar in human form meaning the purpose behind rama was to correct the injustice in the form of ravana as a human read my comment from earlier simply cutting to the chase and bypassing all the obstacles and bringing sita back would defeat the purpose of ramas birth this speaks to a central tenet in hinduism which is that the soul grows only through facing challenges in a righteous way hence why hinduism has the concept of reincarnation and enlightenment it is only through multiple births can the primal cosmic energies we call souls grow mature and reunite with brahman rama was re born as a human for this reason for the shakti within him to retain its strength and grow through challenge so that at he conclusion of the quest it can reunite with brahman
india,not_removed,this is why we dont have ramayana nerds too many plot holes and fanfics nothing is canon other than the one rss intends to shoot you with
india,not_removed,thanks
india,not_removed,cue fukfukfukfukfukfukfuk
india,not_removed,well brainiac works with superman from jupiter krypton
india,not_removed,but karna is related to the pandavas as much as theyre related to each other

india,not_removed,the journey of the instrument across continents and centuries the harmonium was conceived in the west but today largely resides in the east particularly in the indian subcontinent so much so that many mistakenly think it to be an indian instrument but the fundamental difference that made such adaptations possible at all was this western music is based on harmony indian music on melody the naysayers notwithstanding the harmonium became popular across a wide spectrum of music rural folk music all over india in ghazals urdu poetry set to music kathak north indian classical dance thumri north indian semiclassical variation and khayal north indian classical vocal following in the forgotten footsteps of dr kratzenstein who adapted the concept behind a chinese musical instrument to suit european music another doctor dr vidyadhar oke a pharmacologist who resigned his position at a pharmaceutical corporation to pursue his interest in music has invented a harmonium that can play the shrutis microtones required by indian classical music im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme

india,not_removed,brrr check out the bolded part the creditors are for the most part of the meshree vaishnavite or shrawuk jain classes a waneeo commencing life spends his time partly in a large town and partly in some remote country village he borrows a few rupees at interest in the town with which he purchases small supplies of clarified butter oil molasses and other such articles and thus stocks his village shop the cultivators having no money at hand barter small quantities of their grain or cotton for as much oil as will keep their evening lamp burning for an hour or for little supplies of groceries they are perfectly unaware of the market value of their raw produce and are quite satisfied that they have made a bargain if the waneeo with a politic show of liberality throws in a little more of the article he is selling under the name of a bonus having collected a sufficient quantity of raw produce the trader carries it to the town and sells it there at a favorable rate and his capital thus augmented he returns to the village to commence operations on a larger scale a cultivator perhaps has lost his bullock the waneeo steps forward immediately to lend him money at interest to supply his loss or perhaps the is engaged in marrying his child or in performing the funeral rites of his parent the trader will advance him money to supply him with the clarified butter molasses clothes or other articles which are indispensable on these occasions charging for them twice their value sometimes the cultivator prefers to make his own purchases in the town but he must then take the waneeo with him to act as broker between him and the town dealer for he feels that the latter will otherwise charge him anything he pleases and besides he has no money and cannot borrow it except from the village lender for the curious feeling in regard to rights which is so prevalent among the hindoos applies here and the village waneeo will consider his property invaded if any other trader propose to deal with his constituents on these transactions the waneeo of course gains largely sometimes however he will say to the cultivator i have no ready money but if you will tell me what you want we will go together and purchase it and it shall be put down to my account he takes care moreover to hint to his victim what praises he has heard of the liberality of the family and how necessary it is that their honor should be maintained by a large expenditure on the present occasion he adds that such celebrations do not happen every day but only once or twice in a lifetime that the money will not be thrown away and that nothing is easier than to make it up again he will also say i have every confidence in you and am ready to advance you any sum you wish in this way flattering his pride he easily plunges him deeply into debt there is nothing more adverse to the prosperity of the hindoos than this unfortunate feeling of theirs in regard to money and expenditure with them a mercantile man has abroo honor he is a respectable man nay a great man — a muhajun — by which they merely mean that he is wealthy though he may be indeed he too frequently is selfish meanness itself similarly a landowner or cultivator is dheerujwalo — a courageous highspirited man — that is to say he plunges himself into irretrievable difficulties merely because he has not strength of mind sufficient to enable him to despise the tittletattle of his neighbourhood but to return to our waneeo — when the occasion for all this extravagant expenditure has passed away the waneeo demands his bond he tells the cultivator you have so much to pay to the gheedealer so much to the clothseller and so on to all of which the cultivator assents the waneeo says now give me my kothulee choramun meaning a fee for loosening the pursestrings which must be paid in ready money for luck or as a good omen the cultivator procures one per cent in ready money from wherever he can and pays it he has further also to make a present not only to the person who writes but also to those who attest the bond interest is stipulated for at two per cent per mensem or if the terms are unusually moderate at one the bond prepared the cultivator scrawls beneath it his mark — a rude representation of a plough when the next crop is ready and the government share has been paid the creditor exerts himself to carry off all that remains the cultivator with much entreaty obtains enough to subsist upon for a short time and he is credited on account of the remainder with whatever the waneeo may be pleased to allow him sometimes the trader carries off nearly the whole and when the cultivator talks about a subsistence says what need you care when yours is done you can have as much as you like from my shop thus the cultivator is driven to the waneeos shop for grain to eat and grain to sow his field with the terms of lending are that the borrower shall repay twice the quantity of grain he takes away when his crop ripens the next harvest comes round but now all the grain which is left after the payment of the government demands goes to pay for that which was borrowed last year and there is nothing left to pay the interest of the bond this then must be added to the principal and so the bond goes on swelling year by year— the trader who is well aware of the practice of the courts of justice taking care to have it periodically renewed and carefully closing every loophole through which his victim might escape the creditor will now probably reside principally in the town and on his occasional visits to the village he puts up at the house of his debtor who is obliged to maintain him as long as he remains there if the waneeo have a son to many or a pilgrimage to perform the debtor is obliged to lend him his cart and bullocks and on such occasions he must also come forward with the usual present the moneylender has by this time begun to assume a very high tone and to demand payment threatening to sell the cultivators house or his bullocks in fact as a villager would say he becomes more oppressive than a raja in a few years the waneeo having thus made himself the master of numerous cultivators amasses a large sum of money he now turns his attention to a higher prey and seeks to become the creditor of local chiefs and landowners his first step is to get himself introduced to the chiefs man of business whom he gains over by gifts and promises this agent accordingly takes the first opportunity of praising the trader in the chiefs presence and intimating his readiness to advance as much money as may be wished for when occasion arrives money is accordingly borrowed from the or shet at which dignity the waneeo has now arrived and the man of business prepares a bond and brings it to the landowner for his signature the chief haggles like a child for a sum of ready money to be presented to him as the price of his affixing his seal but cares little

india,not_removed,par usme naam toh poora hindustani tha
india,not_removed,can you please elaborate
india,not_removed,it is based on demand and supply this isnt about the government ordering a fixed quota á la soviet union it just means whenever a local munipical or state body has a need it will give preferential treatment to domestic companies but a everyone is welcome to compete and b contracts are only supplied on a perneed basis supply and demand is still intact as the story makes clear the us has had a law like this since the
india,not_removed,noif people buy indian manufactured products that will help indian companies thereby increasing the gdp if people ignore indian and keep buying foreign then majority of the money will end up going out of india filling the pockets of foreigners dont talk like an expert in economics if you arent p
india,not_removed,that is thrown in our faces when its about labor laws or minimum support prices for farmers produce
india,not_removed,do you have a daily outrage quota or something to fulfill
india,not_removed,toi comment section is that way
india,not_removed,translation please
india,not_removed,or maybe it isnt about emulating america just doing whats right the us example is just used to show those screaming about muh free market that india isnt doing anything radical here
india,not_removed,government is not telling anyone anything its a policy for procurement among government companies
india,not_removed,branded in usa made in china
india,not_removed,modiji is a govrnment employee too
india,not_removed,is the plan to get the left over humvees from afghanistan dropped was there even a plan or just a rumor
india,not_removed,india based firms and products should be encouraged only when they give a minimum guarantee of quality at a fair price not because they are india based
india,not_removed,hasnt the us generally been a world leader in churning out great products and services
india,not_removed,narender ke moonh se nikalti rehti hai
india,not_removed,well isnt the government churning out one outrageous measure after another
india,not_removed,i got tired reporting zero quality articles today so far i havent found a good article today
india,not_removed,maybe my comment was specifically in response to the one that pushed american actions as justification and also werent we always told what awesomeness free market economics will usher in when they made a case for paring down labor welfare and profarmer protectionism
india,not_removed,colour me surprised when the people in power with bijness interests start using this as a legal way to buy from their own companies
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,with free surveillance from us government under project prism
india,not_removed,mraps it fell through but i dont know why
india,not_removed,minimum quality is a benchmark that needs to be fulfilled regardless of whether it is indian or foreign what this policy does is it helps create an ecosystem inhouse for various sectors government is a massive buyer so if it chooses to buy domestic then it incentivizes more companies to set up shop in india that builds the ecosystem and this will push more companies to set up for consumerend manufacturing because we already have an established ecosystem
india,not_removed,so what us is a world leader that doesnt mean we cannot
india,not_removed,whats outrageous about this one
india,not_removed,thats true the government is also launching an amazonlike marketplace to buy stuff so i expect the process to be a lot more transparent than it is today also you are assuming that such bijness interests dont dictate procurement today
india,not_removed,purti d
india,not_removed,the only smartphone that comes with an inbuilt hypocrisymeter
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,what this policy does is it helps create an ecosystem inhouse for various sectors a policy is one part of an ecosystem you can create as many policies if the right conditions are not met you wont get anywhere for example it might happen that consumers would end up with low quality products for the same prices
india,not_removed,we can doesnt mean we are

india,not_removed,as a mumbaikar hypothetically would you not be dismayed if contract for supply of led lights for an iconic part of the city be handed over to an obscure psu than to pioneers like philips especially when theres precedent that smaller towns have chosen the latter with good results
india,not_removed,if it helps they were probably too worn out to be of any real use
india,not_removed,yeah lets stay like beggars and lets depend on us for all our needs globalism zindabaad
india,not_removed,mumbai is not a big enough buyer so it wont work but hypothetically if you assume that the bmc is a buyer that is large enough to impact the fortunes of companies like philips then a policy as this will create incentives for these companies to set up shop in mumbai it creates jobs in mumbai and helps the city because these new workers consume more things adding to more jobs effectively bmc will still buy from pioneers like philips except we now have a plant in mumbai itself having said that it is still an unfair comparison when india buys from abroad we spend usd and that can have several macroeconomic consequences buying from inside india does not cause similar repercussions
india,not_removed,oh then its ok i guess
india,not_removed,that doesnt fit well with free market economics does it
india,not_removed,free market is a sham to bully developing countries like ours to buy stuff from developed ones
india,not_removed,thats not what is said when farmers ask for minimum support prices
india,not_removed,how is farmers asking for msp related to free market kuch bhi hag doge naa
india,not_removed,when farmers ask for msp bjp apologists berate them for expecting government protectionism and say farmers should now compete and sell in the open market

india,not_removed,what inner party democracy are you talking about a school teacher living in my neighbourhood was an aap member and he told us that aaps central leadership does not like anyone challenging them there have been numerous defections in aap and anyone speaking against kejriwal has been silenced kejriwal is the face of aap and there are no other names that have the same pull among people there fore any one who speaks against him is silenced sucha singh tried to do that and he was removed via sting
india,not_removed,huh yogendra yadav and prashan bhushan were kicked for speaking against arvind mps were kicked from punjab aap for speaking against party
india,not_removed,its inner party democracy when dissenting voices are heard by the leadership here aap leaders and volunteers are rebelling and fighting each other because they are opposed to kejriwal arbitrarily removing leaders opposed to him this is what happens when there there is a lack of inner party democracy
india,not_removed,did you forget a s
india,not_removed,if facts mattered to this guy he would not be speaking baseless things
india,not_removed,they were kicked out because they were being unrealistic and naive one does not win the game of thrones by being ned stark you need to be a combination of varys baelish and tywin yoyo and pb couldnt scale up and were sacrificed in the name of the larger benefit of the country
india,not_removed,while your point is largely true you are discounting the politics played by modi to get to the top and that very well will have included such ousters within gujarat bjp and even the central leadership just because it isnt widely reported doesnt mean it never happened
india,not_removed,so in short no democracy power ke liye kuch bhi karega
india,not_removed,whose benefit do you want to win the game of thrones for tywin littlefinger and varys are supposed to be the villains of the story and their ambitions and actions caused untold misery to the kingdom you are acting as if kejriwal becoming a dictator and using corrupt and unethical tactics to rule is a good thing how is that in the larger benefit of the country

india,not_removed,appeasement article repeating the pakistani rhetoric to pakistan
india,not_removed,this is not something they did to keep up an image they have been telling this is what will happen next time you hit us and carried out their threat not many people expected they will
india,not_removed,it is funny how the writer writes for a pakistani news website sources given in the article are also from the same newspaper writer surely wants india to allow the terrorists to cross the border without any obstacles kill our soldiers innocent civilians the idea of peace in writers mind is clearly so messed up that he has become a sympathizer of terrorists i am glad that gandhi did not have such messed up concept of peace in his mind otherwise axis would have had equal chance of winning edit just noticed how the poll in article is heavily in indias favor
india,not_removed,modi has become a prisoner of his own image the inflammatory commentary by politicians experts and journalists is a result of the mushrooming clout of the hindu rightwing which is ready and willing to discount peace in the region at least rhetorically india knows that it cannot entirely isolate pakistan from global affairs for pakistans geostrategic location is too important for the country to be left alone by the world in the aftermath of attacks such as uri it has to assuage its constituency that it will take tougher measures against pakistan than the previous congress government whom it blames for being too soft on islamabad since geopolitical realities dictate that india cannot get all of the international community to sideline pakistan new delhi is resorting to even stronger rhetoric to make up for the facts and satisfy the more hardcore elements of its constituency the truth is that india cannot break a world banknegotiated treaty since that would invite the opprobrium of the entire international community including indias allies here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme

india,not_removed,i by no means accept the secession of kashmir but theres a reason why article is still enacted in kashmir its still a part of india that theoretically can secede from the indian union when we put a blind eye and start blaming another nation entirely for a part that we claim is dear to us we are fooling ourselves their have been recent reports where the state government of jk has accused the union of not keeping them in loop of the operations in the valley we fail to question that were all the law and order options fully evaluated before calling the armyprimarily the police the army has been used rigorously and few exarmychiefs have come out saying that army hasnt always been excited by raking control of the situation in the valley
india,not_removed,lawyer mihira sood draws out the differences between real nationalists and the pseudo kind the basic premise of the show was that pakistani involvement alone is responsible for fuelling anger against the indian state in parts of kashmir that there are no legitimate grievances that resident kashmiris can have with the indian army and that anyone who says otherwise is a traitor this can range from the liberal media to human rights advocates public intellectuals antiwar activists secessionists and sometimes actual propakistan people in this context doves are those who aim for friendly relations with pakistan instead of war does this make them propakistan im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme

india,not_removed,eidgah godan and kafan are just wonderful always loved premchands stories one of the most influential writer in modern hindi
india,not_removed,i will tell about a premchand story which disappointed me i have seen satyajit rays movie shatranj ke khiladi at least five times one of my favorite movies now usually books on which movies are based are better than the movies so after watching the movie quite a few times i picked up premchands story shatranj ke khiladi with great anticipation but got hugely disappointed one cant even comprehend how that grand a movie is based on that small twothree page story the story was good but it was merely good in comparison to the greatness of the movie no offence to munshi premchand and he remains one of the greatest i read about a similar experience some other guy faced he like most of us had heard a lot about the story of the wooden horse and the attack on troy trojan horse this story has had many spinoff from that theatre to movies to books so this gentleman did not read the wooden horse part of the story in homers illiad which made the story famoys till he was eighty years old he saved it for his old age finally when he picked it up the story turned out to be relatively bland and short one no literally satisfaction in reading it in original he wanted to kick homers ass for that

india,not_removed,revealed how ford foundation got the modi government to back off from its expulsion move revealed how ford foundation got the modi government to back off from its expulsion move leaked emails give the first account of how one of the worlds wealthiest charitable foundations negotiated to rescue its india operations in the winter of december months before the modi governments crackdown on over ngos started the ford foundations offices in new delhi learnt through informal sources that its funding of an organisation run by activist had drawn the interest of gujarat state police although the funds that were granted were for routine activities related primarily to research and the building of organisations dedicated to improving communal harmony — according to internal documentation of the affair — the language used in setalvads initial proposal regarding the godhra violence kicked off a series of events that plunged the foundation into a chaotic mess the stakes involved according to the account pieced together by one of the worlds wealthiest charity funding organisations prime minister may have been initially tempted to send packing from india a set of emails leaked by detail the developments after december from the perspective of officials – how they grappled with the impending controversy their view on the modi governments motivations the allies they recruited and the strategy they formulated the emails are from the personal inbox of john podesta campaign chief chairman to hillary clinton and are mainly from darren walker president of ford foundation as they troubleshoot their way through the sticky situation of finding themselves on the watchlist as part of the evolving criminal investigation against setalvad these emails mostly sent from may to july show that there was a very active outreach from the ford foundation not only through its senior global and india officials but also by roping in the help of trustees such as infosys cofounder n r narayana murthy april how it started on april nearly six months after the first learnt that its connection to setalvad was being viewed warily by modi government times now reported that the gujarat police had asked the ministry of home affairs to look into whether the had violated rules governing foreign donors and more importantly whether the foundation had acted in conflict with indias national interest two weeks later the times of india reported that the organisation had been put on the government watchlist throughout this month the foundations internal communication suggests that neither gujarati law enforcement nor any agency of the national government formally contacted the foundation until the month of may while no official government contact was in the offing the foundation did receive a tipoff from an indian journalist in the form of a document that confirmed its position on the modi governments watchlist after learning of the governments action indirectly an internal document notes that all grantmaking within india was ceased by the beginning of may officials in its new delhi office along with walker kicked into damagecontrol mode reaching out to lawyers and engaging international media monitoring firms multiple requests for a meeting with modi were sent out requests that apparently stressed the foundations readiness to strengthen its review procedures and find common ground in terms of programmatic priorities these requests ultimately proved to be unsuccessful however on may the trio of walker infosys murthy and kavita ramdas fords india head met nripendra mishra principal secretary to the prime minister finance minister arun jaitley and what one document describes as the influential commissioner for gujarat bharat lal in separate meetings its unclear how successful these meetings were because three days later on may walker sent one of his first emails to podesta im just back from delhi and need your advice on a sensitive matter would you have time for a brief chat in the next couple of days the email reads followup emails show that this is around the time that podesta started receiving semiregular updates from the team in new delhi in one correspondence on may walker attaches a document of background materials on the current controversy — which explains in detail their shortterm action plan and thanks him for reaching out to foreign secretary s jaishankar many thanks for speaking with me last night and your willingness to reach out to s jaishankar on our behalf as promised please find attached background materials on the current controversy between ford and the indian government im happy to speak further if the information contained raises questions that need clarifying walker wrote modis gamble through the eyes of ford foundation pms initial reaction seems to have been to send us packing deauthorize us fully – this was the assessment of the last year based on insider accounts and insights that was shared with podesta modis reaction was apparently influenced by the gujarat polices investigation into setalvad when the gujarat police contacted home affairs the intelligence bureau also got involved and flagged fords perceived transgressions in the setalvad funding to the pm the ford foundations background reads the troubles began when the gujarat police ordered the foundation to turn over internal documents related to sabrangs setalvads organisation funding the original sabrang proposal to the included strong and accusatory language against the bjp and thenchief minister modi for the gujarat riots although the foundations funds were stipulated for routine activities related to research public education an online archive and the building of a network of organizations interested in advocating for improved communal harmony the language included in the background portion of sabrangs proposal was very personal with respect to modis potential culpability and once in the custody of gujarat police became a new center of focus – and eventually the source of another allegation of foundation meddling in political affairs said the us groups version of events leading up to its inclusion in the watchlist the fact that gujarat police were eager to find something on setalvad one of modis worst critics for some time would have led to interpreting ford foundations past actions in that negative light they calculated it seems it was indeed the language accusing the state government and appearing to take sides that led the authorities to conclude there was political overreach by the foundation it was apparently the intelligence bureaus evaluation which stopped modi from following through on his initial instincts to send us foundation packing iib indian intelligence bureau warned that it did not have strong enough evidence to justify that the background note says modis political advisers also tallied up the risks of say an embarrassing defeat for the government in court thus the decision to place us on a watch list a relatively standard move related to the treatment of greenpeace and others it said referring to the suspension of fcra license and the freezing of the bank accounts of the environmental ngo a couple of weeks before this evaluation was shared us ambassador to india richard verma had publicly expressed concern about the challenges being faced by ngo because a vibrant civil society is so important to both of our democratic traditions i do worry about the potentially chilling effects of these regulatory steps focused on ngos he said at a lecture on may in april us state department spokesperson marie harf said that the us remained concerned about the difficulties caused to civil society organisations after suspension of greenpeace and restrictions on ford foundation the foundation however felt that these public pronouncements may not have had the desired impact on the indian government it is very possible that the interventions by the usg did not go down well at all especially those carried out in public it said lack of subtlety and nuance—or at least none perceived was the denouncement from ford foundation the uss public statements were criticised in the foundations background notes as being rather tonedeaf it was all delivered as very general concern tied to respecting civil society and the usual american narrative about threats to democracy in other countries and how other governments should behave not we understand and respect your concerns about ford but it would be great to resolve this in ways that serve all our interests bureaucracy running amok mha at fault at the same time ford foundations troubles may have been caused by officialdom throwing out the rulebook in the absence of any clear instructions from the political leadership and the modi government version function i post the articles text as a comment if the website is adblocker unfriendly powered by

india,not_removed,this is not what indian rail needs we are so far behind when it comes to rail i have family in vijayawada which has one of the biggest rail stations is india and serves as a major junction for trains going north from chennai and south from hyderabad and kolkata and every time i am waiting for a train there is a stinking odor of shit in the rail station the platforms and track need to be cleaned with better tools we need to put escalators and elevators for the elderly on bridges that connect platforms on every damn platform instead of just putting a hole on the train having a effective sanitation system on trains where the flushes actually work or even maybe autoflush for those who are too lazy to flush or too unable is a good idea we also need to spend on electrifying all the broad gauge routes creating bullet trains for major rail routes delhimumbai mumbaikolkata kolkatachennai chennaimumbai hyderabadbangalore bangalorechennai for a few to compete with cheap and comfy flights and buses to make it bearable for many passengers putting a roof over the major junctions in major cities over the platformslook at pictures of rail stations in germany and the uk and making them cool without using ac is good idea too it is costeffective and futuristic keeping clean lounges putting better notification signs at every station enhancing a computerized rail network to make trains run faster and more on schedule apps to help passengers navigate foreign stations and making it easier for private organizations to the cargo services of the railway instead of being kleptocratic and socialist and maybe putting a few dinner cars for longdistance trains could help boost rail revenue by a ton it is truly beyond me how politicians cant think beyond improving their own wealth and staying for the next term by betraying the very people that elected them and endowed their trust on they don t do what they are supposed to do and instead scam the youth and middle class get the poor fat and drunk by giving them biriyanis and quarters and help themselves by building their own palaces and ventures like this what is the point of being elected when you cant do anything to the people
india,not_removed,common man is never going to use these helipad shit this is for politicians they build stuff foe themselves
india,not_removed,my state hasnt even gotten trains yet
india,not_removed,why the fuck would anyone with a helicopter come to a railway station who the fuck are these pleb executives who need lounges in railways stations why the fuck do we need world class facilities in local railway stations
india,not_removed,helipads for those retarded fat netas to descend without having to learn about the harsh traffic people face every day of course if they are foolish enough to think that anyone except them and rich class owns helicopters wastage of space for the most part executive lounges for the same fatarse politicians to rest their smelly pimpleridden arses in an airconditioned room exclusively made for them as if they are ever going to allow people to come in there dedicated pickup and dropoff parking facilities and parking for plus vehicles full of taxiwallas and loiterers spitting paan all over the place goons lurking all over and nearby residents throwing their trash world class facilities lol what stations with just crore lakh per station you cant do jack shit with lakh let alone provide world class facilities maybe you can build a building or two alongside those dangerously dilapidated and trashed structures we call railway stations and that is if if those crore reach down to ground level intact a decent percentage will be siphoned off along the way to me this sounds like another fake promise released in the news for pr brownie points
india,not_removed,crore for stations thats lakhs per station thats why you shouldnt look at everything in terms of averages smaller stations can make do with even lakhs like those villages and hamlets in heartlands bigger stations like metros and junctions can take more
india,not_removed,a big lol we know where this is going this is for creating extra space in the politicians pocket
india,not_removed,while the news is shitty if true please note that budget allocations are on year to year basis for such works eg if a new railway station is being built government can set aside a set total budget of expenses irrespective of time it will take like crores in years and this is called project expense but works like renovation maintenance etc fall under the head of maintenance budget which is revised on year to year basis untill the work is finished
india,not_removed,lack of station masters cctv cameras chennai incident no additional trains announced in south but only good in managing headlines and hiking prices for the poor fraud central government
india,not_removed,why do they announce hundreds of everything this and smart cities first develop a few learn from the experience perhaps refine the model and gradually implement across the country i understand inter state politics can be an issue in that case they could develop ut stations like cgpy etc
india,not_removed,its easy print billboards and give paper ads with coming soon to the station near you who cares if theres any real development as long as theres a news article
india,not_removed,executive lounges are very useful the one in delhi almost always have people in it and comes in quite handy to people coming in city just for a day or are taking another train
india,not_removed,so the government essentialy just wants to make big announcements because they havent given a timeline and they havent allocated enough money
india,not_removed,this is true been to jhansi station recently there were huge billboards hanging all around the place claiming how clean the station was going to become with a big picture of akhilesh yadav and modi i looked around and what i saw was the smelliest and dirtiest railway station i have ever seen in india you could literally see the shit on the tracks and stains of paan spit and dung every inch the toilets were so bad the people didnt even come near them the entirety of the platform and connected building structure was dilapidated and grungy oh the irony this is just another pr attempt good for billboards but never coming into action
india,not_removed,i would rather have that money used to improve conditions for the mass rather than a few safe and clean drinking water clean tracks improving the pa system upgrading schedule display monitors signage traffic flow outside railway stations parking lots turnstiles benches escalators lifts railing along the platform i can think of a ton of things that can be spent on which can improve the experience at the railway station for everyone including the people already on a train stopping at the station
india,not_removed,partly true the part about making headlines rest gov is follwing procedures it can not allcate maintenace budget for future financial years infact by allocating such a small amount it seems the decision maker is being practical in understanding fund requirements as initial efforts would be more towards plannning resource allocations creating a couple of prototypes and mobilisimg efforts towards it why would they need huge fund atleast till for such a large project infact i have never understood how they give timelines at the time of announcements of large projects it requires a lot of analysis planning and brainstorming just to derive timelines i believe political leaders should just show the vision make announcement and step aside for bureaucracy to derive timeline and budget requirements
india,not_removed,this is the same poo in the loo talk why spend on space stations when you dont have toilets we can do these things together
india,not_removed,eh what the point is that we dont need helipads and executive lounges in railway stations presently in the unrelated argument you cite we need both a space program and toilets
india,not_removed,well they will just pirate it

india,not_removed,even we are aware of that i think most people are and many are proud of it that they like our movies there etc but the bullshit that their deep state engages in leaves a bitter taste after that we also like their artists but you need to know is when attacks happen every other day when they meddle in kashmir as much as they can they are just testing our patience and pakitanis go along with it like yesterday we killed terrorists why are the average pakistani feeling offended and when the terrorists kill our solders why do they feel proud there must be a reason for it dont you think

india,not_removed,internet economy reality check at startups after a funding boom in which indian internet startups attracted more than billion over months venture capital firms changed their approach in asking entrepreneurs to cut costs and avoid pursuing sales growth by offering deep discounts photographs by hemant mishramint mint for indian internet startups this year turned on its head valuation markdowns executive departures job cuts market share losses to american rivals and a lack of bigticket fund raises dominated the headlines in it was a total departure from the previous year when startups touted highprofile recruits from the silicon valley hired thousands of engineers and enjoyed the fruits of a fastexpanding internet market attracted massive funding and were assigned jawdropping valuations startups pulled in only billion in funds in the year down from a heady billion in which was largely powered by large rounds at flipkart ola snapdeal and paytm according to data from startup investment tracker tracxn the number of midstage and latestage deals has dropped significantly this year as the likes of tiger global management softbank group corp and dst global three of the most active backers of internet companies pulled back after a funding boom in which indian internet startups attracted more than billion over months venture capital firms changed their approach in asking entrepreneurs to cut costs and avoid pursuing sales growth by offering deep discounts many of the startup stars of —flipkart snapdeal ola grofers oyo and zomato—went into costcutting mode mergers among struggling companies distress sales and startup shutdowns increased sharply if gmv gross merchandise value—a vague measure of gross sales excluding discounts and sales returns—was s favourite term unit economics revenue and cost per unit or user was the buzzword in this shift will continue in some other trends too will stick focus on cutting losses at consumer internet startups generating lesscostly sales growth mergers and acquisitions possibly even among indian unicorns strong investor appetite for startups in digital payments financial technology and enterprise software and increased efforts by venture capital firms to get exits from past bets one event will go a long way in determining the investor sentiment next year especially for latestage startups the fundraising efforts of flipkart the torch bearer of the indian startup ecosystem that has seen its valuation chopped by some of its own investors yet things are not all as bad as they look on the surface a few winners emerged this year paytm the countrys largest digital payments provider saw its valuation more than double to roughly billion indias demonetisation initiative provided an unexpected and massive boost to paytms business in the past quarter freshdesk backed by accel partners and tiger global became the breakthrough enterprise software startup offering hope to investors that saas software as a service startups may be much more capitalefficient bets than their consumer internet peers in fact the overall volume of deals actually increased slightly this year more than deals have been completed this year compared with in indicating investor appetite for earlystage startups is still strong ecommerce digital payments and in particular enterprise software or saas were among the top sectors this year theres still a lot of capital available for indian startups venture capital firms including accel partners sequoia capital kalaari capital and nexus venture partners raised more than billion in typically it takes at least three years for vcs to exhaust funds and while the euphoria over indian startups wore off this year vcs still raised more than billion in then the launch of services by reliance jio infocomm in september is expected to reduce data charges and improve mobile internet speeds which will help in expanding the internet market in any case much of the pain at top indian startups was selfinflicted its probable that if the top indian startups hadnt messed up so badly in the gogo days funding wouldnt have slowed so sharply in the first place flipkart indias largest ecommerce firm lost its way badly in after making disastrous and wholly unnecessary decisions the most embarrassing of which was an experiment to ditch its websites and become an apponly platform it spent much of undoing the mistakes of and now finally seems to be amid a turnaround instead of putting all energies in keeping uber at bay cabhailing service ola distracted itself in by launching services such as food delivery and grocery ordering which failed to take off in ola shut most of these services and doubled down on its cab business and held its own against uber to be sure however optimistically one looks at the events of its become clear that investors overestimated the potential of indias consumer internet market a population of more than billion rising mobile internet penetration and increasing incomes are supposed to make india the last big unconquered ecommerce market but this year the online retail market is estimated at around billion barely higher than last years the weakness in online retail highlighted an awkward truth while the number of internet users is growing rapidly the number transacting online isnt increasing at the same rate raising concerns whether internet firms can attract enough new paying users to back investors rosy projections it means flipkart amazon india and others will have to come up with innovative products and services to push the growth of online retail in rather than relying on just macroeconomic factors version function i post the articles text as a comment if the website is adblocker

india,not_removed,oh pls andhra pradesh rajasthan uttar pradesh maharashtra bihar madhya pradesh delhi as someone already pointed out a whole bunch of indian origin nobel prize winners are not southies in fact no one has won the prize from india after independence
india,not_removed,maybe but essentially south indias are just workers all they can do is work under someone else look at all the billionaires in india
india,not_removed,both are not indians first one is a british indian and then american second is a canadian fact is that no indian scientist have won nobel science prize after independence jai hind

india,not_removed,whats wrong with u u even acknowledged to the guy u overlooked the scientists he linked that got nobel prizes not from south not everyone who gets into the iits turn out to be great scientists not everyone who wins a nobel prize in science is a great scientist
india,not_removed,nah we are screwing our own ass
india,not_removed,all the three were americans when receiving nobel prize
india,not_removed,i thought you were talking about maharashtra now youre going to piss off the shiv sena
india,not_removed,well south indians are a lot worse in geography if you are any indication
india,not_removed,where did the whole bunch requirement come from i am just proving u wrong about the fact that southies are better at math and science a weirdly held myth which i think stems from south being richer and thus in general being more educated

india,not_removed,in goa aap is campaigning for a ban on mining and gambling two big industries and revenue sources for the state something tells me that even if they win they are not going to follow through with the ban they are idealistic and revolutionary in rhetoric pragmatic and status quoist in practice this is the ideal combination and it works because the media is friendly and does not try to expose these contradictions
india,not_removed,wine and beer shops have opened in crm shahadara in last years they are adjacent to each other too
india,not_removed,after holding public hearings through concerted campaigns swaraj abhiyan the splinter group of aam aadmi party aap has now raised a red flag against delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal for concealing truth on distribution of new liquor licenses after coming to power yogendra yadav the founding member of swaraj abhiyan and the expelled national executive member of aap has challenged kejriwal to tell the truth in public about the issuance of new liquor licenses in the national capital by the state government in a scathing letter written to the cm on tuesday yadav has questioned the delhi government about reasons for concealing information from the public regarding liquor licenses given to shops and restaurants i am releasing a list of new licenses that aap government has issued to liquor vendsstores and restaurants etc it is a lie as proven by the list of licenses which we are releasing yadav told firstpost here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,and how is this fucking wrong free market economy while other cms are imposing archaic prohibition crap here is a leader who aspires to think differently
india,not_removed,this is wrong because he said we have only released licenses after coming to power while yogendra claims they released try to read the article before commenting
india,not_removed,and whats the thought being thunk differently how are more liquor shops beneficial to the public what was the basis of this action
india,not_removed,why should anybody trust this guy he has a massive case of the sour grapes
india,not_removed,well the liquor shops do bring in huge revenue to the govt so that they can spend more on ads
india,not_removed,how many liquor shops should be the ceiling as per you socialists
india,not_removed,why should there be a ceiling as many shops as the market will bear high time we got out of the nanny statist vision of indira gandhi and now increasingly the butchers of the sangh
india,not_removed,if we go by this kejriwal also has sour grapes over his loss interference by najeeb jung etc why trust anything he says
india,not_removed,because rtis revealed the list and i think a party formed on the basis of rti activism should uphold the right
india,not_removed,ordinary businessmen dont open liquor shops you can bet this is a part of party fund raising as well a lot of mlas got richer here
india,not_removed,aap is the one regulating liquor shops and im the socialist such logic much wow
india,not_removed,if so simply remove all restrictions why exactly just deregulate and clear the way completely for market forces
india,not_removed,so it was not regulated before aap
india,not_removed,totally agree punish the criminals eg drunk driver molester etc but disassociate the product from the abuses
india,not_removed,increasing it by makes aap awesome and not socialist
india,not_removed,increasing what by i thought we were discussing whether alcohol regulation was imposed by aap or not and i am not discussing whether aap is socialist or not what i am discussing is people like you who think of government as maibaap and want them to decide whether liquor is beneficial or not before allowing liquor shops no wonder you people like modi who decides how much airlines should charge for tickets who subsidises air travel who sets rules for matrimonial websites who snatches land who provides government subsidised internet etc

india,not_removed,rte strikes again a hindu teacher working in a minority school need not appear for tet whereas a muslim or christian teacher working in a nonminority school will have to clear the tet how can this be justified asked a teacher
india,not_removed,yeah tet should be made mandatory and also b ed examination
india,not_removed,hundreds from government aided nonminority schools may lose jobs the dse had made it clear that the tet would be the last opportunity for the teachers to clear the test subsequently disposing of another batch of cases related to nonminority school teachers who were appointed after the go the high court on january this year referred to the failure of the government to conduct tet regularly except on two occasions in and and directed the state to give them one more opportunity to clear tet while the dses communication insisted upon ousting teachers of government aided nonminority schools alone it was conspicuously silent with respect to teachers of schools run by the government municipal corporations panchayat unions the teacher said stating that a representation had been made to the state government for conducting refresher courses for all school teachers instead of forcing them to clear tet a teacher from virudhunagar district said we are now pinning hopes on the school education minister and the secretary of the department for finding a solution to the crisis he also pointed out that the union cabinet chaired by the prime minister had on march approved an amendment to the rte act for extending the time limit up to march for the teachers to acquire the prescribed qualifications im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,arent minority schools exempted from most of the rules under rte act this is just one of those exemptions secular schools have to follow rules so they cant give them the jobs without tet

india,not_removed,wouldnt it increase costs for nonminority schools
india,not_removed,i really dont know that act isnt secular and i dont think anybody gives a fuck until there childs school gets shutdown and then theyve to send them km away but the people affected are poors so not a single fuck is given to their plight

india,not_removed,this bhopal central jail is considered to be one of the most secure jails and first indian jail to get iso certification
india,not_removed,my personal feeling is this was a staged encounter where the policemen had made up their minds to finish off these suspects instead of recapturing them that said the murder of a security guard is probably real it is unlikely that he would conveniently die of natural causes during the encounter or be killed only for staging itthis can be checked from his wounds itd be easy to tell if he died from a police bullet and public sentiment regarding staged encounters generally depends on who was killed when it is known gangsters or terrorists generally it is supported as a necessary evil considering the weaknesses of our justice system
india,not_removed,most senior police officers in bhopal including my dad have been awake and alert since am it has been kind of a martial law in denser areas there is literally a policeman on every street and roundabout today extremely tight security following this shootout early on you couldnt even go inside the railway station without checking good job police this is the kind of enforcement we need although to an extent i am still not sure if ths was legit encounter or not condolences to the family of the security guard his daughter was about to be married later next week i hope his death doesnt affect their family too badly or it could be really sad edit spell correction
india,not_removed,all these simi innocents did were to cut a policemens throat escape jail killing them is killing democracybelieve me as i hate modi
india,not_removed,hahagood jobvery well executed policemen i would expect more such planned activities in future also condolences to the family of deceased security guard
india,not_removed,without really commenting on the authenticity of this encounter as many other redditors have i would like to recommend everyone to read framed as a terrorist by nandita haskar to know how easy it is for the police to fake stuff and declare people terrorists again not suggesting this was fake could be could be not just pointing out that it isnt highly unlikely for it to be either way
india,not_removed,this shit seems fake as fuck how did they end up in the same spot they cant be that dumb this really looks like a planned encounter to me
india,not_removed,good these mofos are killed now go and unite with your hoors
india,not_removed,good wipe simi out completely
india,not_removed,im not judging whether the encounter was fake or genuine but how the news agencies are calling them simi terrorists is questionable according to news piece from the hindu these were the alleged members of simi eight alleged members of the outlawed students islamic movement of india simi were killed in an encounter by madhya pradesh police none of them was charged under terrorism all of them were accused of various crimes such as bank robbery murder and sedition
india,not_removed,nitish is saying one of them is bihars son mulayam said he is about to adopt them but police fucked up
india,not_removed,classic case of fake encounter look like police caught them alive but decided to bump them off unlikely the escapees were armed

india,not_removed,rindia celebrating people dying since take a bow
india,not_removed,simi is terrorist organization but this encounter dont seem legit as usual all encounters in india seems to be fake law should be upheld no matter what is the crime and criminal police just cant shoot and claim encounter
india,not_removed,guess they didnt take into account amit shah polarisation and up election
india,not_removed,i think the freedom fighters killed the security guard and escaped post that the cops decide to kill them and not capture them alive its wasnt staged form the beginning but improvised imo
india,not_removed,when it is known gangsters or terrorists generally it is supported as a necessary evil considering the weaknesses of our justice system but they were not they were innocent people framed by the police of the above guys are the same ones who got killed today
india,not_removed,please thank your dad and his colleagues from all of us for keeping us safe and secure
india,not_removed,if you doubt the authenticity of the encounter may be we should doubt if they really killed the security guard as well probably the security guard had some dirt on the higher ups and they conveniently killed him off its not like theyre going to release the cctv footage now is it
india,not_removed,i would expect more such planned activities in future are you saying this encounter was fake they planned to let those guys escape and then simply trapped and killed them
india,not_removed,honestly you shouldnt celebrate this while we have no idea of the facts of the case extra judicial killing sets a bad precedent and certainly should not be celebrated
india,not_removed,someone said the encounter went on for an hour and they had guns
india,not_removed,this guy has some inside information
india,not_removed,why cannot it be a lack of planning on the escapees side also why would cops make it look planned i am sure if you and i can think through this the cops would have thought that as well if this was planned and the guard that got killed probably they asked him to sacrifice his life
india,not_removed,what if the virgins were actually gay men these criminals essentially deserve those
india,not_removed,is that you frank reynolds
india,not_removed,why all of the guys killed were innocent falsely framed by the police there were no charges of terrorism against them heres an article from they were most likely going to get freed according to sources the court was set to pronounce the verdict within a few weeks in probably in favour of these undertrials
india,not_removed,dont talk non sense they are madhya pradesh ke bete digvijay and scindia have the first right of refusal
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,no mention of fire arms recovered from them yet seen a postencounter video on a news channel showing police recovering knives from the dead bodies
india,not_removed,its not uncommon to give shoot at sight order if the suspect have killed someone in the law and order dept
india,not_removed,terrorists are people
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,bhopal is in mp by that logic anything that happens anywhere in the country has to do with elections everywhere else conspiracy theories shouldnt be stretched to this degree
india,not_removed,freedom fighters
india,not_removed,innocent people who sliced the throat of a security guy and escaped
india,not_removed,do you have to make every issue a hindumuslim one and take the side of muslimsclaiming they are being targeted every single timewhat are youowaisis pa or something
india,not_removed,unfortunately perfect security and perfect liberty cannot coexist a lot of people fail to understand that legalize firearms
india,not_removed,were at a turning point in the history of our nation you either trust the cops or you dont no middle ground and if you dont youre an antinational nothing adds up in the fucking scene the person of authority mentioned that the escapees were armed with spoons and platescops couldnt catch few cunts armed with spoons and plates maybe im wrong maybe im not we will never know
india,not_removed,according to sources the court was set to pronounce the verdict within a few weeks in probably in favour of these undertrials
india,not_removed,probably the guard died on the job due to some aliments police probably planned the encounter around it not that i am complaining
india,not_removed,escaping was not planned these guys were cought and probably were willing to surrender but were encountered
india,not_removed,rather obvious no people are smart enough to plane an escape from jail and instead of splitting to improve their chances of evading arrest they all stick together in one place for the cops to gun them down en masse
india,not_removed,precisely
india,not_removed,pretty obvious isnt it
india,not_removed,encounter file is maintained differently guess these guys were in it most likely they were taken to that place clueless and rest is obvious i know of a guy alleged criminal who was in the custody yet he was being taken to be encountered he was told to get off the regular prison transfer as he is supposed to meet his attorney he figured it out conflicted self injury and evaded false encounter he knew they could not fake encounter him with those injuries as it would look like a torturedeath
india,not_removed,the video of encounter police shoots at point blank after the bullet hits him the victim raises his hand there are no guns around the dead persons
india,not_removed,it does sets an example for other potential criminals planning to jail break prisoners set lose is a threat to everyone
india,not_removed,maybe to send a message hypernationalistic hindu middle class will only applause at this being a fake encounter minorities in question will get the message to stay in their aukaat just making a guess but we cant overlook the fact that this is very obviously fake
india,not_removed,come one man homosexuals are better than these century hooligans
india,not_removed,what they deserve gay men
india,not_removed,why all of the guys killed were innocent falsely framed by the police saying they may not really be terrorists and wanting a fair trial for them is one thingbut why are you playing the role role of cji and declaring them innocent
india,not_removed,they may be innocent before but killing a police officer and escaping a prison makes them criminals the encounter may be framed and they could have been captured alive but there is also possibility that they tried to resist and shooting them was necessary my point is being framed by the police doesnt give them a pass to kill a police officer and thats why shoot on sight orders were necessary
india,not_removed,my comment was about simi in general
india,not_removed,they were most likely going to get freed then why try to escape
india,not_removed,how can they run while the direction of the knife is inward given its sharp as fuck and probably slit himself
india,not_removed,go through anti ad block bot last paragraph
india,not_removed,well they didnt rehearse properly
india,not_removed,according this union minister this encounter has enhanced the morale of country
india,not_removed,it does make national news owaisi has no business also yet we know he is hand in gloves with bjp
india,not_removed,no conviction minority freedom fighter jk op was being sarcastic
india,not_removed,you saw them do it why dont you apply the same logic to accused such as modi amit shah sadhvi pragya etc they have far greater blood on their hands
india,not_removed,if you put me in jail wrongfully id do it
india,not_removed,for the second time
india,not_removed,in this country legalizing firearms right now would be disastrous to an unprecedented extent
india,not_removed,they were armed with knives made out of spoons while escaping from the jail hindustan times says they even held a hostage for several hours inside the jail before escaping
india,not_removed,blind or agendabased distrust is as bad as blind faith the person making an accusation or counteraccusation should have something to back it up otherwise it feels like heshe is needlessly being suspicious and creating controversy like in the batla house case where those claiming it was staged were unable to give any explanation for why a policeman was also killed or any evidence that his fellow policemen shot him
india,not_removed,proud to not trust the cops the government or the media im proud to be called an antinational fuck you very much
india,not_removed,so they werent just sociopath islamist terrorists but idiots too
india,not_removed,someone suffering from an ailment that could cause him to drop dead any time wouldnt be a security guard on duty
india,not_removed,very much this
india,not_removed,they already escaped in the past from khandwa jail
india,not_removed,they might have had a safe house or might have been waiting for extraction if i were a terrorist i definitely wouldnt break out of jail without a plan to get me out of the general vicinity quickly taking public transport would be too risky even if i had outside clothes because my face might be shown on tv and anyone from the conductor to fellow passengers might inform the police where i went the cops probably did kill them when they could have been arrested but it isnt very illogical to stick together with a manhunt out theres only so many places that are safe to lie low
india,not_removed,wtf
india,not_removed,woah dude
india,not_removed,and the cop killed himself because
india,not_removed,sop when dealing with terrorists in the pathankot attack operations one soldier died when he tried to check if one of the terrorists was dead or not
india,not_removed,in the recent press conference police says they recovered two desi pistols along with a few sharp weapons
india,not_removed,sorry extra judicial killing is unlawful unless there is a clear and present danger you shouldnt be knocking people off that example then transcends into other areas and becomes dangerous to the average citizenry for all the talk of modernity modern countries arent those where people go on dates and drink and alcohol but countries with strong institutions which protect personal liberties and the rule of law
india,not_removed,because police said so
india,not_removed,we know who is we here wtf are you smoking man can i have some
india,not_removed,not proved
india,not_removed,well in that case prepare to be shot too
india,not_removed,why were they arrested in the first place
india,not_removed,thats your way of looking at it
india,not_removed,whi cares potential jihadi are dead
india,not_removed,true that shame on the police they killed freedom fighters
india,not_removed,youre not alone
india,not_removed,sociopath islamist terrorist source which terrorist attack did they do they were even not convicted they were undertrails how can they be terrorists when they were not even being accused of terrorism but idiots too no whenever police senses that they are going to get freed by the courts the police does this thing of jail break and fake encounter
india,not_removed,yep nothing new who knows how many such people have been bumped off not that im sad for them since they have killed the security guard but killing people in an encounter haha

india,not_removed,as i said in the other comment you cannot have perfect security of the citizens without compromising the liberty its not practical we need to make a choice draw a line somewhere they escaped the prison twice murdered a guard which itself is a heinous crime others are accomplice they were a threat to the security of the citizens already this is a lesson to other criminals repeat offenders in my view its justified but you can feel free to disagree

india,not_removed,agarbattis yo
india,not_removed,nice turn an innocent into a criminal
india,not_removed,do you think police has some personal issues with these guys they got arrested and were undertrial because of some prima facie evidence which is needed for arrest and judicial custody why were they not out on bail because court denied it why because court thought they are charged under nonbailable offense if they were really innocent why they didnt wait for the verdict why they brutally killed the guard while escaping
india,not_removed,i was replying to the guy above me who seems to be under the impression that the police killed these guys because they were armed with spoons and plates that being said we need to be sure that these are indeed jihadis before sending them off if they did indeed kill a guard as the papers are reporting then i have no sympathies
india,not_removed,yeah freedom fighters just like savarkar golwalkar bal thyackery maya kadnani amit shah advani etc
india,not_removed,you seem to know everything about this case so please tell us the mystery behind the police guards death did police kill him
india,not_removed,you can try this video taken immediately after the encounter by ani
india,not_removed,your entire response is a strawman unarmed men running away in their sights did not merit extra judicial killing al youre doing is making petty excuses your type of thinking is dangerous and irresponsible there is never any justification for killing unarmed men extra judicially i know the psuedo right doesnt care much for the constitution but geez
india,not_removed,hmmit might have been planted before filming
india,not_removed,kinda did that yourself when you slit the throats of a guard
india,not_removed,it takes a long time to get out of jail police puts fake cases against them and then years later they get released see the following case i linked you the tehelka article terrorism cases against them are fake some of them were petty criminals and some innocents with no links to terrorism if they were really innocent why they didnt wait for the verdict why they brutally killed the guard while escaping we cant really say what happened there needs to be an inquiry on how the guard was killed and how they escaped or what happened if they are indeed guilty of killing the guard they are murderers not terrorists maybe they got frustrated or were being tortured according to sources the court was set to pronounce the verdict within a few weeks in probably in favour of these undertrials
india,not_removed,i cant tell anything about jailbreak or the death of the police guard but they were not terrorists they were falsely framed by the police heres an article from some of these guys are the same from khandwa jailbreak
india,not_removed,and your response isnt insighful either how did you conclude that they were unarmed why do i need to make excuses as if i am the offender here i just said that for me it is justified they were killed you can disagree to that there is never any justification for killing unarmed men extra judicially which law book says this and those were not unarmed men those were terror suspects undertrial huge difference your type of thinking is dangerous and irresponsible thanks for judging me i rest my case
india,not_removed,what that is so dumb thats like tormenting someone mentally and driving him to suicide and then say he did it himself the court will fucking rip your butt into many pieces
india,not_removed,but they were not terrorists they were falsely framed by the police why would they be needed to be encountered then whats their backstory
india,not_removed,nah you cant just throw your claims around an run away they were innocent they werent terrorists they were killed in fake encounters all this sounds like a great conspiracy but when confronted with one solid fact of a murdered security guard you claim ignorance thats some subterfuge it all needs to gel well for a conspiracy theory to work
india,not_removed,what exactly do need for insight to understand extra judicial killings are unlawful the indian consitution the indian penal code ever heard of habeas corpus yes suspects under trial not convicted
india,not_removed,torturing someone to kill themselves and killing someone else to escape are not the same apples and oranges mate
india,not_removed,in a dramatic development during the trial a bomb exploded in a court hall in hubli on may — a day before the accused were set to be produced in court investigations later revealed that rogue elements linked to right wing hindutva groups were involved in the blast why is that everytime trail is supposed to happen and there is a good chance of them getting freed things like these happen who knows who killed the guard are there no cctv cameras in the high security jail
india,not_removed,oh for fucks sake you really are dumb or what i am talking about creating circumstances for an innocent to either harm himself or harm others remove that prod hindoo chashma you might see some human beings
india,not_removed,and there it is when you cant produce a valid argument to defend your claim the ad hominem attacks begin in no country or laws does it say you can kill someone and not face any repercussions are you innocent and jailed take legal recourses to prove that and set yourself free there are plenty of non violent ways to get out of bad situations if you choose to kill someone and its not in self defence you should be ready to face the consequences
india,not_removed,amazing drive someone nuts by wrongfully putting him in prison and then expect him to have trust in that same system what the hell are you even smoking and the law you are talking also applies to the people who uphold the law police cant be vigilante dot end of the story
india,not_removed,i really dont think people go insane just because they are put in prison and start killing guards otherwise wed be hearing about a lot of dead prison guards and trust it or not you live in a society with rules and a system you dont have to like it to follow it i agree with your second point the same rules apply to the cops as well there should be an independent investigation and if they did indeed kill innocents they should be charged with murder but all of the above is just moving away from the original argument you said you would kill a guard if thrown in prison and i said prepare to accept the consequences which may include you getting shot if you take a life it doesnt matter if you are innocent or not be prepared to forfeit your own
india,not_removed,i really dont think people go insane just because they are put in prison and start killing guards otherwise wed be hearing about a lot of dead prison guards oh my god you think thats not enough trigger to someone go insane then what else is but all of the above is just moving away from the original argument you said you would kill a guard if thrown in prison and i said prepare to accept the consequences which may include you getting shot if you take a life it doesnt matter if you are innocent or not be prepared to forfeit your own dude you are just not getting the point creating circumstances so that innocent can turn into a murderer is not enough
india,not_removed,there are prisoners in guntanamo who are tortured on a daily basis and they have not gone mad and killed people if you think just getting incarcerated drives people insane then there is no point in further discussion as you clearly dont understand the human psyche as for creating circumstances to turn an innocent man into a murderer this sounds like a hollywood movie plot or some cia operation taking another persons life is not something anyone does on a whim its an ultimate act which changes everything in their life life is not a video game where you just kill someone and thats the end of that killing someone who was doing their job just because you couldnt take it anymore definitely makes you guilty of that and any prior claims of innocence are now moot im sure you can claim insanity or try to justify the murder but that is for the courts to decide innocent people do not harm others to prove their innocence
india,not_removed,there are prisoners in guntanamo who are tortured on a daily basis and they have not gone mad and killed people if you think just getting incarcerated drives people insane then there is no point in further discussion as you clearly dont understand the human psyche you want to talk about human psyche when you clearly dont understand a shit about it you gave a sweeping statement that if those prisoner havent done it that means nobody else will do
india,not_removed,i simply gave an extreme example that if people under those conditions dont do it people under lesser circumstances would probably not do it either its clear to me that you are set in your opinion and nothing i say will sway you so id prefer not to discuss this any more good day to you

india,not_removed,are there any people who dont think that muhammad or jesus existed in real life
india,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikihistoricityofmuhammad in short yes he did exist the mythological parts well he is the newest of the three so more evidence exists httpsenwikipediaorgwikihistoricaljesus may or may not have or may even be multiple peoples stories who all came to be ascribed to one person the mythological parts well cant find a wikipedia link for rama but some books i have read said he may have existed but the timing is so far back treta yuga that trying to even put a date to it is really pointless same for mahabharat which occurs at a time after ramayana the events may have happened but the one book i read about the possible ancient history of mahabharat said that it was essentially a war of tribal chieftains that is pretty much the impression you get from vyasa mahabharat too small time kings perhaps
india,not_removed,muhammad pbuh did exist his period was fairly recent compared to the others you mentioned ce his existence is corroborated not only by his followers but also by his contemporaries from other regions as emissaries were sent to the roman and persian empire during his lifetime his life has been well chronicled you can read more httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimuhammad edit added wiki link
india,not_removed,existed or not but there has been lots of bloodshed in their names forget them and move on
india,not_removed,comments will be good grabs popcorn
india,not_removed,muhammad and especially jesus existence are very much probable but definitely not certain
india,not_removed,i believe they are manifestations of various personalities the personality may have existed but without proper evidence we cannot believe theyas a person did
india,not_removed,could you point me to these historical proof i think a ruler named ram did exist any empirical evidence for that claim
india,not_removed,you should read the entire article on the historicity of muhammad not just the first paragraph hes not the guy described in quran and there are very few nonmuslim sources that say the same just because a few books say he existed doesnt mean there is enough proof same case with jesus and rama just because some religiousbooks say they existed doesnt mean they did
india,not_removed,there was a lot of bloodshed in the name of adolf hitler are you saying we should forget the holocaust and move on those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
india,not_removed,muhammad and especially jesus existence are very much probable but definitely not certain are there any serious historians that doubt their existence and why especially jesus is there any reason muhammads existence more disputable
india,not_removed,you know there are claims that muhammad is actually what the syrians called the christ can you point me to some sources which validate the existence of jesus as a person
india,not_removed,i am not claiming the persons the books talk about are the religious figures prophets gods we know the people muhammed and jesus one or many together now identified as one may have existed is the consensus you could ask in raskhistorians and get a detailed answer easily perhaps they have someone specialising in indian mythological characters and their histories too
india,not_removed,bro that analogy is really bad d
india,not_removed,yes but hitler can be criticized discussed his ideology critically analysed and can be called names without the threat of persecution whereas the same cannot be done with religious figureheads in countries like india and elsewhere without the threat of persecution using blasphemy laws so the second best thing one could do is to not talk about them at all and hoping that these prophetsgods and their adulation die out due to general lack of interest
india,not_removed,i actually meant to say that jesus is more disputable but i guess it didnt come out that way i am not aware of serious historians who doubt their existence but at the same time are not certain either i think the most popular theory for jesuss existence is httpsenwikipediaorgwikicriterionofembarrassment i was reading about these things pretty long ago when i read the da vinci code so i am not sure if there is any new concrete evidence to make existence of jesus christ certain as far as i know there are none

india,not_removed,fuck youyour cars are over priced already
india,not_removed,fuck i thought i could wait until feb to buy my first car
india,not_removed,why reduce
india,not_removed,by the way you forget their cars such as the swift vitara scross have passed with good ratings in international crash tests but in india though the government barely gives two shits about the kind of car they sell so in the interests of being more competitive and earning the attention of the rupee conscious buyer theyve noped out of stuff that can save hundreds of peoples lives you cant blame them for the state of safety of their cars in india its a mix of factors including lack of any regulation buyers who look solely for highest mileage and the lowest prices and a general who gives a shit attitude
india,not_removed,maruti car lacks important structural safety feature called crumple zone thats rubbish all marutis have crumple zones
india,not_removed,bhodsike ameerzaadon fucking rich brats there are people who cant afford even the erstwhile nano while the government has banned their old cars from road even they are fit in the name of pollution to benefit the aforementioned rich brats and their families the management of car makers

india,not_removed,maruti cars have no structural integrity see the global ncap results below all cars in the list got stars because they had no airbags ncap tests are done on the model with lowest specs of a car the important distinction between others and maruti is that structural integrity is maintained for foreign brand cars but not for maruti check bottom right for structural integrity result in the images swift and alto best selling cars in india on a crash at structural integrity is lost ie if you crash at a higher speed the occupants have to be scrapped up from the road using a shovel ncap results maruti swift maruti alto httpiimgurcomxqibscepng ford figo vw polo original results here httpwwwglobalncaporgresults

india,not_removed,they do work
india,not_removed,mercedes benz dead maruti swift all survived
india,not_removed,structural integrity makes sure you have a crumple zone
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,huh thats a weird thing to write its the other way round crumple zone helps towards structural stability however its not the only thing contributing towards structural stability i dont see anything in those test results to back ops claim that maruti cars do not have crumple zones also talking about test results i think all cars of that range which were tested failed renault kwid hyundai eon scorpio etc

india,not_removed,who reads shit toi anyway
india,not_removed,goodbye readership
india,not_removed,no problems for me and i am using ublock origin on chrome
india,not_removed,try this looks like its working add this url httptimesofindiaindiatimescomdetector in ublock option my filter list
india,not_removed,same with economic times
india,not_removed,nice now we need to educate people in our circles to use adblockers if they arent already its a much better way to rid people of toi than asking them to stop reading it willingly
india,not_removed,lol i love how they tell you to downright uninstall ad blocker rather than disable per domain
india,not_removed,chutiya website with autoplay videos every time i block them they make new placeholders for videos a week later they mention steps to disable adblocker but list out steps to uninstall it completely
india,not_removed,do works for me
india,not_removed,now that a lot more people are noticing this issue here is a solution mentioned by that has worked for mesince i use ublock origin httpsgithubcomreekantiadblockkillerantiadblockkillerreek
india,not_removed,so toi pulled of a forbes
india,not_removed,strange no adblock warning on this link
india,not_removed,awesome now i dont even have an excuse to read it
india,not_removed,im scared that my dad will actually remove adblock completely and download some scareware or ransomware due to that
india,not_removed,indiatoday pages have the following message firefox private window runs its own version of adblock you will receive an adblock detection screen on private window even if you are not running any adblock plugins in this case you will need to open forbes on your standard firefox window
india,not_removed,instead of asking users to whitelisting their site they are advising them to completely remove the adblock wtf
india,not_removed,use httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailublockorigincjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm and enable in ublock options or use httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailopenviagoogleweblightmjmakbbjhpnaebjpopafngkoliinenjisupport edit add this url httptimesofindiaindiatimescomdetector in ublock option my filter list
india,not_removed,the instruction is to completely remove adblocker most people who use it will do that
india,not_removed,i remember reading an article yesterday about all major news outlets in india banding together and doing this so far it seems only toi has implemented it
india,not_removed,looks like other online newspapers are also following this checked amarujala and its also blocking users with adblock now i can finally stop checking toi amarujala and other shitty papers
india,not_removed,im using ublock origin and apparently even whitelisting their site shows the antiadblock page regardless
india,not_removed,paisa ppaa ppapp paisa toi want more paisa
india,not_removed,antiadblockkiller would be made in a day or two
india,not_removed,unable to use economic times any easy solution for not so technical people i use adblocker on my chrome
india,not_removed,now itll look like adfly and linkbucks
india,not_removed,toi trying to assert dominance over the partner in the relationship by performing the online equivalent of shitting in the bed
india,not_removed,they do need money to run their website its a normal thing to do these days
india,not_removed,hindustantimes indiatoday economictimes are also doing it i think more newspapers will also start doing it httpfactordailycomadblocking the top news websites in india including times of india and hindustan times are joining hands and taking a stand against people who use adblockers starting thursday users who visit these websites with adblockers enabled will be asked to turn them off to be able to get their daily news fix senior executives and insiders at the times of india and the hindustan times who did not wish to be named told factordaily other publishers who will be part of this adblocker blackout could not be independently confirmed but the sources cited above said the indian express the hindu dainik bhaskar amar ujala among others would also participate
india,not_removed,there is really is very limited quality news content about india when travelling abroad or for nris it ends up being a case of chalta hai and tolerating shitty journalism
india,not_removed,they dont care about the readership of adblocking users anyway they dont produce any revenue for them
india,not_removed,i have the same configuration ublock origin on chrome i wonder why it is different for different people can you check the porsche link that is on the homepage of toi
india,not_removed,if youve gone just to the homepage try clicking on an article thats when the toi block shows up for me
india,not_removed,this works for me
india,not_removed,awesome thanks man
india,not_removed,add httpjsetimgcomdetectorcms to your custom filter
india,not_removed,it works copy paste from below timesofindiaindiatimescomelemhide
india,not_removed,i too use ublock origin toi opens though
india,not_removed,yup seems like certain pages are still accessible
india,not_removed,epic
india,not_removed,tried the setting change still doesnt work
india,not_removed,thanks buddy
india,not_removed,most people who use adblockers are already annoyed by ads they will completely stop using either site or circumvent the latest silly block
india,not_removed,india today has also
india,not_removed,good idea
india,not_removed,im doing the same now toi can go fuck itself
india,not_removed,i am going to do this now for british sites like guardiandaily mail who constantly spout shit against indian race those articles against modi and bjp are great but the moment they and their comment section start on ridiculous patronization it becomes a nogo
india,not_removed,the hindu is working fine with adblocker
india,not_removed,the entitlement of these freeloaders is incredible they wont pay for subscription and neither will watch ads but still want quality news what a joke
india,not_removed,check your ublock origin settings and enable
india,not_removed,its working for viewing headlines but blocks articles from viewing
india,not_removed,oh yeah damn apparently i can only access the homepage
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,if you are using chrome click the abp logo options add your own filters type timesofindiaindiatimescomelemhide and add filter go back and refresh the anyways crappy site with shitty articles
india,not_removed,if you just want to read any article you could use this open via google™ web light proxy extension
india,not_removed,aaah so i am guessing the rest will catch up soon
india,not_removed,you compared guardian and daily mail wow truth about india sometimes hurts
india,not_removed,the entitlement of these freeloaders is incredible maybe you should see the kind of shit these ad networks serve before frothing at the mouth fucking flyby banners autoplaying videos giant banners everywhere and popups not to forget the huge amounts of data they consume and the resources they use up they wont pay for subscription does the toi website have a subscription option neither will watch ads only because these fuckers have made this entire ads business a massive fucking nuisance want quality news quality and toi okay
india,not_removed,people do not have an issue with ads the problem is when ads lead to bad ux and collection of user data
india,not_removed,dude its internet it my right to get it free if not someone will come around with a workaround
india,not_removed,toi doesnt produce quality content despite having ads everywhere explain that their website is easily their greatest source of revenue more than newspaper sales in the entire country combined its just greed lets not forget all thel bikini model slideshows on their site which have the sole purpose of driving up website readership greed has consumed toi and taken it far away from any respectable definition of journalism there are very few things that randia agrees with nearunanimously and one of those is that toi is shit
india,not_removed,the people with adblockers might share interesting story on facebook or tweet sending more readers to toi site and those readers might not have adblockers people who use adblockers will figure out how to outdo this latest silly wall and will go on with their life if the content and site is interesting enough
india,not_removed,still getting locked out
india,not_removed,thanks mate checked the option and its working for me
india,not_removed,thanks this worked for me rather than adding another chrome extension to the ever growing list
india,not_removed,guardian is even worse than daily mail at least the mail never pretends to be something serious the guardian spews lefty bs all day long about why james bond needs to be a woman or why everything is the fault of straight white men
india,not_removed,the guardian might be a bit better than daily mail shit but they and their comment section is racially abusive heck most of the headlines about india there are patronizing or intent on portraying anything in a bad light that is what i have problem with truth about india sometimes hurts what do you mean mate
india,not_removed,frothing at the mouth looks like you are the one frothing
india,not_removed,you are not entitled to a good ux if it sucks simply go somewhere else its a free market after all go somewhere where you like and collection of user data is not illegal is it collecting data allows them to target ads giving better revenues so that they can spend on better ux engineers and give you a better experience
india,not_removed,damn look at the entitlement over your head its going to break your neck i cant wait till the day all news services become subscription only if not someone will come around with a workaround money doesnt grow on trees you want news while you give back nothing of value fuck you then
india,not_removed,the entire internet is mostly free only because of ads if some people think they are too fuckin intelligent to shift the burden of running a service to other people they can fuck off
india,not_removed,yup same result
india,not_removed,you need to install a scriptmanager greasemonkey for fftampermonkey for chrome and the userscript as well for it to work have a look at the httpsgithubcomreekantiadblockkillerinstruction for more info
india,not_removed,did you click apply
india,not_removed,spread it as much as possible to screw their ads
india,not_removed,of course i am i have my reasons unlike you though
india,not_removed,when you overlay an ad over the text which i came to read on the website it defeats the purpose of my visit so yes it is a prerequisite to visiting the site targeting yes but a line must be drawn as to what data and how much data is collected there is a difference between collecting user data and invading privacy it should not drive you to go incognito just to search for a product online because you want to avoid being bombarded by its ads everywhere you visit and most websites use third party ad engines so it is nowhere related to hiring better ux engineers or even spending on resources the data is collected by ad engines not by media companies
india,not_removed,the entire internet is mostly free only because of ads and yet despite adblockers these sites continue to survive i used to run a tech related site where majority of the loyal users used to use adblockers and i still made good amount of money essentially not many people use adblockers if some people think they are too fuckin intelligent to shift the burden of running a service to other people i use adblocker and toi site is the epitome of how its hurting rest of the sites people use adblockers after getting frustrated with sites like toi and keep it on for rest of the sites they can fuck off sure there is nothing much valuable content on toi that i cant read on other sites there are much better sites that monetize the content in other ways so sites like toi can fuck off and i keep my adblocker enabled
india,not_removed,try this on toi website push then you can right click on refresh and select empty cache and hard reload
india,not_removed,yes i did is it working for you im using chrome on windows
india,not_removed,its probably not working because aak will need to be updated to circumvent whatever toi has done
india,not_removed,must be a schmuck from toi d
india,not_removed,yeah try running a service for charity and then lets see your reasons now stop frothing and learn economics
india,not_removed,are you too fucking dumb isps are not the ones creating content on the internet for your lazy ass to browse isps are paid for the physical infrastructure airtel does not pay reporters on the ground to report on the happenings int he country the bunch of people commenting here are dumber than facebook commenters jeez
india,not_removed,and yet despite adblockers these sites continue to survive i used to run a tech related site where majority of the loyal users used to use adblockers and i still made good amount of money essentially not many people use adblockers them blocking those who use adblockers suggest they are not able to survive and hence these drastic measures also im sure you ran a massive pan india conglomerate employing reporters on the grounds and your other revenues all paid for it i use adblocker and toi site is the epitome of example of how its hurting rest of the sites people use adblockers after getting frustrated with sites like toi and keep it on for rest of the sites sure use it theyll block you and this game will continue they cant waster bandwidth on who pay nothing or write tot the editor asking for a subscription service or join on of the meany subscription news online i bet you wont pay for something silly as news as most indians are just free loaders sure there is nothing much valuable content on toi that i cant read on other sites there are much better sites that monetize the content in other ways so sites like toi can fuck off and i keep my adblocker enabled godspeed let the market decide
india,not_removed,the developer here httpsgithubcomreekantiadblockkillerantiadblockkillerreek mentions a lot of steps are you sure checking just one option in ublock origin should suffice
india,not_removed,haha and you are from freeloaders association of india i presume
india,not_removed,oh i absolutely understand the need to monetize a website what you dont know or are capable of understanding is that people dont want to be fucked by the absolutely distracting annoying ads as someone whos been running a couple of websites and writing for a bunch of others i know the pain that these ad blockers cause to us however the users are doing so in response to the nuisance that these ads have become heck try to browse a whole range of websites on an android phone and come back to me if you dont get annoyed by the popups random apks getting downloaded and ad networks redirecting you to appgame pages on the play store now stop frothing and learn economics learn economics hahahhahahahaha okay

india,not_removed,there have always been accusations of vindictiveness against this government and now here is proof from the defence minister himself this would be noted by most who are considering investing in india due to the make in india campaign no doubt they now have to consider the government of india and bjp risk factors anything from a statement from an actor endorsing your company to a product that hurts sentiments can bring the might of the ruling party on you wonderful
india,not_removed,when the actor did this then the company which he was endorsing was an online trading company some of our people are very smart i know there was a team which was working on this they were telling people you order and return it the company should learn a lesson they had to pull his advertisement parrikar said defence minister openly admits that bjp has an it team that attacks private citizens who speak up against the government excesses
india,not_removed,first of all it wasnt aamir khan that commented on intolerance but spoke about what his wife a hindu was feeling about the situation in india secondly sending a troll army after someone for their opinion shows how insecure you are as a person and as a ruling majority government thirdly it also says a big fuck you to foreign and local businesses and shows your investment can go down the drain over just a mere opinion by a third person who is just affiliated to you in a sponsorship capacity lastly god save this country
india,not_removed,one khan says something antigovernment and we all gang up on him and try to teach him a lesson another khan shoots endangered wildlife runs over people ruins lives and we give him per movie the fuck is wrong with us and heck the other khan barring dhoom has even given us much much better cinema
india,not_removed,i will show my tolerance by teaching you a lesson for calling me intolerant slow claps
india,not_removed,targeting people for voicing their opinions is so noble you ar the defence minister of india you should not be defending the trolls from the actor
india,not_removed,do your work chutiye every other day there are pakistani and chinese incursions or attacks you are also loosing airplanes
india,not_removed,we as a country seem to be huge fans of teaching lessons whatever that means
india,not_removed,one of the shittiest defence to this entire culture of shutting out voices through sheer numbers and force are that hey at least we didnt shoot you up like what happened at charlie hebdo how can you call us intolerance like really our standards for tolerance are as low as isis or jihadi fundamentalists
india,not_removed,and our tough defense minister had no qualms allowing isi to inspect our premier defense base while pakistan outright denied any access to our agencies this chutiya defense minister is only tough against the citizens of his own country it seems
india,not_removed,thought he is one of the sensible minds around in the bjp with a defense minister like this the government is officially run by loonies
india,not_removed,we have to love our nation call me when your loving citizens start paying taxes
india,not_removed,the real way to teach bjp a lesson is to vote them out in
india,not_removed,and some people are still going to deny the existence of intolerance because it doesnt suit their narrative
india,not_removed,alas i used to think that this man was the only decent politician in india among the raving horde of heaps of dungbrained netas polluting our soil not anymore today i have lost that one last grain of faith i held in indian politicians this man is a dumbass like the rest of them
india,not_removed,i am only trying to point out if anyone speaks like this he has to be taught a lesson of his life parrikar said i am only trying to point out if anyone speaks like this he has to be taught a lesson of his life parrikar said at a ceremony to launch the marathi edition of a book by journalist nitin gokhale mala mahite ahey there was a team which was working on this they were telling people you order and return it the company should learn a lesson they had to pull out his advertisement when the actor did this then the company which he was endorsing was an online trading company they were telling people you order and return it the company should learn a lesson they had to pull his advertisement parrikar said speaking at the rng awards on november khan had said there is a sense of fear more than there was earlier here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,must be taught lesson was the exact reason he was feeling insecure af in india although tbh who cares he or his so called ohsoconcernedaboutpeopleswelfare bollywood filmfraternity wont say one word against beloved bhai therefore all of them deserve to live in insecure hell for the rest of their lives
india,not_removed,typical bjp minister arrogance what you have to say about model state guest with its intolerance towards dalits
india,not_removed,how dare you call us intolerant we will not tolerate this
india,not_removed,actorne jeva hey kela thehva jya company la toh advertise karat hota online trading company hoti aple log thoda jaste hoshar ahet mala mahite ahey there was a team which was working on this they were telling people you order and return it the company should learn a lesson they had to pull out his advertisement when the actor did this then the company which he was endorsing was an online trading company some of our people are very smart i know there was a team which was working on this they were telling people you order and return it the company should learn a lesson they had to pull his advertisement parrikar said what is honorable ministers stand on salman khan btw
india,not_removed,defence minister supporting trolls ordering and returning products on e commerce sites this has to be a new low although bjp looks very strong right now but if you take modi and his pitbull running party affairs with intimidation out of the equation it is a madhouse with fierce infighting and rank crassness these ministers should learn from sushma swaraj how she turned herself around and focuses on her ministry and does not give irrelevant statements
india,not_removed,aamir should issue a statement thanking the defense minister for proving his fucking point
india,not_removed,never go full parrikar india
india,not_removed,no freedom of expression in our democracy especially if you belong to that religion
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,how soon will parrikar get his clean chit so that the bhakts can use it to justify his comments
india,not_removed,holy shit the indian express is a liar ndtv is a liar the defense minister never said what indian media is claiming yes anyone who speaks against the country must be taught a very tight lesson the tight lesson should be sending them to kashmir for a month and my freedom of expression is to expose ammir khan if the common man starts expressing the freedom of expression and celebs the anchors the news agencies start feeling the pain for common mans peoples foe then they not the common man are the problem gone are they days when a select few could monopolize the opinion of everyone else by fake arguments without data without proof of arguments if some one talks about intolerance and i ask those people about data to back their claim up then those people are the problem iff they do not have data fun fact lots of congress supporter people also uninstalled and gave rating after reinstall for the app my foe is as important as aamir khan foe
india,not_removed,aakir khan was taught the right lesson
india,not_removed,i watched the speech it wasnt about amir khan he was talking about perception and morale but i guess amir in headline makes it sell more
india,not_removed,make in india is too little too late its a halfbaked attempt to woo in manufacturers at a time when globalism is struggling and automation is eating away at large scale manufacturing by the time you turn make in india into something feasible it would have been years too late for the manufacturing train
india,not_removed,let me not mince words and say it clearly i interact with foreign investors and as per my understanding it does not matter aamir beef or dadri if at all bjp not being there after is a risk and not otherwise its not that these people are totally heartless and only care about returns but yeah cold fact is that the western world isnt bothered about these things however there is a difference when the churches were attacked by hooligans but hindu right and bjp and govt were blamed the foreign investors did not like it a friend who was in uk meeting investors at that time was told clearly about this risk thankfully that fizzled out kashmir or aamir wont bother them attacks on muslims real or imagined wont bother them within limits but christians and churches are a different story
india,not_removed,people in such high position acting like a road side thug bragging about their petty achievement really sad
india,not_removed,sadreally
india,not_removed,and they are active on rindia too
india,not_removed,no doubt any criticism is against their kulcha they have smartly penetrated the cybersphere and are actively using their trolls to convineintly brand any one who is against their ideology as traitor or antinational sadly the defence minister was one of the few people who i really respected now not so much
india,not_removed,i got it he is defense minister not attack minister
india,not_removed,indian express story is misleading maybe one should watch a video to arrive at truth what actually happened was
india,not_removed,we really lack the ability to take criticism any foreigner comments of womens safety issue in india and people are like your country doesnt have rape or what ours is a country wide littedick complex that we over compensate with aggression and rage honestly we are doomed because literally anyone trying to open dialogue is shut out by idiots shouting at the top of their voices
india,not_removed,edit the defense minster never said what is claimed by the indian media ergo it is the fucking media who is spreading misinformation but spoke about what his wife a hindu how do you know he was speaking truth he protested against modi in in his interview with shekhar gupta he said the us did the right thing by banning him and he laughed off that such a thing has a become a thing of national honor this actor spreads lies thats my foe sending a troll army after someone for their opinion proof any proof of sending the minster never said our people and he also mentioned srinagar incident does anyone even verify the news published by indian express i messaged snapdeal times i do not belong to any army i made sure people cancel orders from snapdeal i do not belong to any bjp army nor do i know anything like this exits i will do it again i will do it again and again if anyone speaks against my country without having data to back it up thats my freedom of expression my non violent way of doing protests if ammir khan has problem with my freedom of expression then a big fuck you to ammir khan if anyone speaks against my country i will make sure those people get a befitting reply i will hurt their pockets i will come for them that is my freedom of expression an actor is not the only one who has rights to have an opinion i also have an opinion that the actor is lying and there is no data to back the actors claim it also says a big fuck you to foreign and local businesses this is exactly what the actor wants this is exactly what the congress wants that is why i will give the actors a big big fuck you when they speak against the country their opinions cannot monopolize or change the investment and i will make sure that their hypocrisies is exposed every single time they make a statement without backing up dataproofsfactslogic the ve karma on this comment exactly show what is the problem when other people start expressing their foe my freedom of expression is a big fuck you to aamr khan a big fuck you to farah khan a big fuck you to those who support jnu
india,not_removed,but in india a man is responisble for his cow wife
india,not_removed,its not even antigovernment to say that my wife feels insecure and fear for our childrens safety because of communal incidents all govt had to do was reply that there is nothing to worry about and they will ensure everyone in their family is safe and the actual number of incidents are very small and get sensationalised in media simple the people worried would have calmed down the pro govt people would get their views vindicated and amir and his family would have been glad to hear the assurance but noooo
india,not_removed,parikkar ji has instructed the it cell to give rating to chinese and pakistani apps and abuse nawaz sharif on twitter mission accomplished
india,not_removed,you sir have summed up the entire randia sub in a comment
india,not_removed,thought he is one of the sensible minds around in the bjp what made you think so he is a hardcore sanghi
india,not_removed,lol sure thatll teach them like it taught them in
india,not_removed,they will cry their shits outbut will revert to committing genocides and communal incidents until people start seeing them as the viable alternative to other parties this is what they have done every time they won the central elections
india,not_removed,redditor for minutes well well well
india,not_removed,those who attack and kill humans for eating beef should be sent to kashmir and the border their services are required against terrorists not against people with a different diet
india,not_removed,by the time you turn make in india into something feasible it would have been years too late for the manufacturing train so what is the alternative
india,not_removed,its entirely possible frankly india does not need more ideas make in india is an old concept what india needs is implementation however even if implemented a lot of the lowskill textile jobs will go to other countries as india moves up the gdp per capita ladder most of those types of jobs are concentrated within nations that has per capitappp or lower india will get there within years the technical skill exists in india for more advanced stuff but the kind of large massemployment manufacturing will soon no longer be possible thats why bangladesh is doing so well because it is so poor and it has bet all its eggs on one basket of their exports is textiles
india,not_removed,so freedom of expression should be curbed because you claim that foreign investors dont care frankly there are bigger reasons to protect foe we havent seen a more aggressive centre in years with its social media army attacking anyone who is critical of the governments policies
india,not_removed,lol really inconsequential state news like delhi church attacks absolutely noone cared about except bjp and rss are apparently huge issues for the foreign investors you know but a statewide justification of muslim persecution absolutely and not mincing words doesnt matter at all maybe its just the people you hang around with id expect right leaning britishers to be crazy enough to say stuff like that though about a blanket trend among investors nah youre totally off there
india,not_removed,hey at least he wears chappals to meetings such a simple person so prod s
india,not_removed,yes its ridiculous how governments in india damagedestroy a domestic startups profitability just because the brand ambassador made a notevencontroversial comment its like they think that businesses can be fucked around with with zero consequence they cant running a business is really hard especially an ecommerce startup where the margins a razor thin anyway and india is severely in need of more job creators like snapdeal and if the government endorses these moronic sabotage tactics it is a bad sign for the business climate the sad part is that bjp calls itself a right wing party
india,not_removed,eknath khadse patriot s torrentsstreaming sites national threat s blind kashmiri greatest achievement s invisible hand up my defence ministry
india,not_removed,there is a right time and place for sarcasm bro
india,not_removed,then they bring out the stats sweden has more rapes than india but they carefully forget to mention how rapes are calculated in sweden took off the condom while having consensual sex that can be rape in sweden meanwhile we dont even recognize marital rape as rape
india,not_removed,unescos award for best comment ever anywhere goes to ufoefor
india,not_removed,i messaged snapdeal times i do not belong to any army yeah with such brainwashed morons volunteering no need to build an army separately good point
india,not_removed,facebook is leaking again
india,not_removed,if anyone speaks against my countrylol its farah khan and aamir khans country too you dont fucking own the country
india,not_removed,you created your account solely to make this comment so afraid of using your original account that you have to create alts to post your views
india,not_removed,are you a troll or someone can really be this retarded
india,not_removed,hes a muslim how dare he speak his mind like hes one of our own was the point they were making clear to aamir khan and all other muslims
india,not_removed,id say massive inferiority complex i cast my vote to include teaching a lesson and give a befitting reply as honourably additions to the lexicon that is indian middle aged unkill english
india,not_removed,dont politics flaired posts require a minimum karma of to comment how did he get that in hours
india,not_removed,yes if you cant attack his argument then attack the person
india,not_removed,we cant become the factory of the world we can become the service center of the world while also becoming the technology center of the world while also boosting domestic consumption i work in marketing one of the services we offer is conversion rate optimization where we test different page variants to help businesses convert more of their site visitors into customers you know whats my preferred tool for doing this is vwocom a tool built by an indian company wingify thousands of other marketers across the world feel the same way vwo regularly competes with much larger competitors and wins a small example in a small niche industry but at least it shows that we can become more innovative
india,not_removed,global politics dont seem to be in our favor either trump has promised to clamp down on globalism if he gets elected and holds true on his promise exports will suffer eu is going through large scale political turmoil some eu countries have been in depression for years now such as spain russia is going through its sanctions and china has its own manufacturing china benefited from the boom years of the the investment that flowed into chinese manufacturing during this period allowed it to set up its gigantic factories i dont foresee a similar boom happening for quite some time now
india,not_removed,make in india is an old concept what india needs is implementation exactly
india,not_removed,i didnt say foe should be curbed i am just addressing the point of overseas investors perception of risk in india what i say is what i see what i want is different from what i see my opinion beef ban is bad dadri was horrible aamir is a cunt
india,not_removed,persecution of muslims really thats what i am talking about people who are smart and large foreign investors mostly are know that there is no persecution going on in india they also know that people who claim such things are either delusional or politically motivated you dont know what persecution is they know and ya thats the kind of people i hang out with and not with some jnu jholachaps
india,not_removed,but a statewide justification of muslim persecution this is some agrade bullshit dalits are persecuted yes muslims are not i am simply waiting for some textbook secularism in india where the state washes its hands off religion and a common law applies to everyone so far the bj party has disappointed on that front but if someone does it i know who will oppose that move first
india,not_removed,this is his way to deflect attention from recent drowning of airfact
india,not_removed,not only that in sweden if a women says that she has been raped times over the course of her marriage then the number of rapes would be and not one add to it the fact that there is massive underreporting of rapes in india because of the stigma attached and the fact that nobody would marry your daughter if she is raped it is foolish to compare crime statistics of different countries
india,not_removed,probably a troll i havent seen such cancerous comment on randia before
india,not_removed,while he was saying my country my country i had the image of a spoilt rich kid lying down on the floor of a mall creating a scene and blackmailing his parents to buy him his favorite toy a toy which he saw that very morning in a tv ad while he was watching chotta bhim chotta bhim a show about a mythological character turned into a cool character so that children subtly get curious about hinduism batmansupermanfictionalnonbiased superheroes what the fuck are those
india,not_removed,let us look at his argument then the guy claims aamir khan is wrong in his comments about intolerance there is no proof that such a thing indeed exists as if there is a intolerance meter through which we can empirically measure the intolerance levels then he goes onto say he wants to send anyone who disagrees with this notion to kashmir to teach them a tight lesson such tolerance much argument very logic wow
india,not_removed,what is his argument other than rambling
india,not_removed,the argument is equally dumb common man gets to express his freedom of expression its called a vote and facebook and twitter and letters to the editor and the ability to write books and become a celebrity yourself
india,not_removed,it and ites combined employ less than million people that is a rounding off error how exactly do you propose the rest of the country scale up to being the service centre and tech centre
india,not_removed,most of india will not get employed in conversion rate optimization and stuff like that manufacturing is the only thing which will bring employment to the masses it doesnt have to all be manufacturing for export
india,not_removed,if he gets elected he wont even if he wins against all odds the us establishment will limit him at every turn the gop elite is largely against him remember that the us congress is very powerful as obama witnessed in the last years of his presidency the difference is that obamas own party was largely supporting him trump will face two hostile parties at once hell be countered at every turn if he gets elected which is unlikely i dont foresee a similar boom happening for quite some time now fdi into india has increased over over the last years id say india has a decent position in the world but when the world economy is growing at via the world bank then there are limits as to how fast you can grow india will almost certainly be in the top of developing economies years from now but i dont think anyone seriously suggests it can replicate china which grew at for years straight and anyway china is increasing its private credit by their nominal gdp growth their current growth numbers are only met by massively increasing private debt this is what japan did in the and do you think china will be different indias growth is slower but more sustainable im actually not that worried about indian growth id pay far more attention to employment which is a huge crisis india does not even have a proper unemployment rate regime in place most indicators show that employment creation is very poor this is creating a massive social challenge over the next few decades
india,not_removed,if history has taught us anything is that money flies away when there is lawlessness no one wants to invest in a place where there is risk of social unrest or law an order problems also the constant problem of rent seeking and corruption from this government will not make it easy for investment to come in
india,not_removed,not sure if you actually think thats convincing anyone government asked urdu writers to not be anti indian cow vigilantes are beating up muslims bjp ministers are making openly genocidal statements foreign investors know whats happening all right they read the same newspapers its not like hidden news
india,not_removed,nirbhaya incident wasnt considered a rape because she died in the aftermath it was only after intense pressure that ncrb changed the way they count sexual assaults
india,not_removed,then the number of rapes would be and not one isnt that the way how they count it everywhere
india,not_removed,then the number of rapes would be and not one isnt that the way how they count it everywhere
india,not_removed,then the number of rapes would be and not one isnt that the way how they count it everywhere
india,not_removed,no he doesnt say this you can take any argument and disagree on it what parikar said was that when army is deployed they shoot straight to kill so we so shouldnt expect them to behave like police what he was trying to say by taking example of amir khan was that creating unnecessary fear psychosis is not right this so called rising intolerance projects india as a place not worth living he said many things in his speech but it seems only amir khan matter people have foe to question others who in turn are using their foe
india,not_removed,what is this whole thread other than rambling
india,not_removed,it makes sense for people who acted like guardians of information the media is facing challenges due to democratization of information your first reaction was to question why a minute account dared to question the narrative of this thread where obviously the tone doesnt favor a party shows a lot about how serious discussions are here
india,not_removed,thats why i said its a tiny example
india,not_removed,fdi into india has increased over over the last years thats quite poor fdi in india grew by in by in by in
india,not_removed,wow i didnt know this any link to corroborate
india,not_removed,by taking example of amir khan was that creating unnecessary fear psychosis is not right thats not what he said though what he said was that people like aamir khan need to be taught a lesson and he elaborated on his example so that his message was pretty clear
india,not_removed,i mentioned the minute account because parrikar clearly made overtures to the existence of the it cell in his original statement and lo comes a fresh account who has only posted two comments defending parrikar and bashing aamir khan i was pointing out that maybe there is a connection
india,not_removed,i am saying manufacturing and other labour intensive sectors are the only way for us to improve
india,not_removed,its easy to grow fast starting from a low base additionally the global environment in was much better in terms of global growth and investor risk sentiment remember it was only after china finally deflated that people started to understand that manyor even most developing economies would not rapidly catchup some of that spillover also went to india in tantrum india today has more greenfield fdi than china does on an annual basis
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,obviously he wants them to face flak for spreading fear and demoralising the army he took an example where people took action against amir for spreading fear a peaceful protest which is democratic you think its bjp cell but majority of people dont like being called intolerant by pretentious pricks people like him need to be called out for fear they spread and that happened his example is not about state its about people s protest he also said this which is far more important this shoes government s stand i do not want to train the army to use the lathi he said he added however that the decision to call in the army was to be taken entirely by the civilian authorities where to use the army is a civilian decision however whenever the army is used full power has to be there otherwise do not use the army he said the defence minister said that under no circumstances would the armed forces be asked to face a situation with one hand tied behind their backs we have to understand what is the importance of national security this question has again come to the fore because of a recent judgment regarding northeast he said
india,not_removed,i feel that many aap it cell accounts have gathered a lot of karma and few users would only show up just to bash bjpand most of the pro bjp accounts disappeared mysteriously many connections can be made but its better to counter the arguments reddit is not big enough for bjp to direct its it cell here while based on how much support some unions from some particular colleges in delhi give aap its easier to discern that aap it cell is in more force here
india,not_removed,youre right but the world bank says that labour intensive manufacturing employment decreases after per capita india has years left india better come up with an alternative to employ lowskill workers and fast because it isnt just india that will suffer from this
india,not_removed,i agree but i also say that it wont happen we have to find alternatives
india,not_removed,its easy to grow fast starting from a low base if that was true then the drunkard would have been able to grow fdi fdi was flat during the drunkards time
india,not_removed,thanks
india,not_removed,obviously he wants them to face flak for spreading fear and demoralising the army spreading fear fear you think aamir khan is spreading fear in what alternate reality are you living the pogrom run by this government and its supporters has most minorities living in fear when a mob assembles outside your home burns your effigies and threatens you with violence then its not a peaceful protest its a threat im ashamed to think that i once thought parrikar was one of the rare sensible ones in this government shame i dont give a fuck about what he said about the army thats irrelevant the way he incited violence and hatred towards aamir is abhorant and should be condemned by all sensible people
india,not_removed,per capita what does that mean
india,not_removed,your opinion my opinion is that amir did spread fear in his usual pretentious style dont use the word pogrom so carelessly did bjp spread the false news of church attacks dalit attacks is a new phenomenon for you what world are you living in you know nothing about politics parrikar in goa was known for his efficiency and honestly but he was also known for a loose tongue he speaks in marathi and kokani you can easily see that he struggles with hindi and eng so translating things said in other languages into english always makes inane things sound scandalous left media is responsible for scarring the monitory bengal rape case church attacks or what not media in its attempt to target modi is responsible for the polarisation the counter bjp offensive is adding to it

india,not_removed,a ace pilot who bombed pak bases in war is friends with pak officers including musharraf people who are taking lives of each other as per professional demand can be friends then why is it haram to talk to peace this is a slight of hand that i dont like ofcourse you can not be ridiculed for calling out for peace bajpayee did it modi repeated it many times a student saying this is a positive sign but should that talk of peace only happen with gymnastics with words should this talk cannot happen without absolving pakistan of its crimes should this talk only happen when both india and pakistan did nothing wrong and wars were like a natural calamity that just happened to both countries so when people are calling out for peace it should be clear that both sides have a role in that pakistan being the instigator was the reason the war happened and her father died because of that war so yes pakistan was responsible for her fathers death not from bullies like rijuju sehwag and that hooda fellow whoever he is people calling other people out on their bullshit are not bullies she put up an opinion sehwag made a ridiculous tweet to show the absurdity of her statement is this the definition of bullying you cannot tell when they are being ridiculous or else you would be a bully
india,not_removed,so when people are calling out for peace it should be clear that both sides have a role in that i know that and will chose to leave it on professional assement of intel and foreign department you are completely missing the point you can prepare fight and win war and yet talk peace those two arent mutually exclusive
india,not_removed,if it wasnt clear i was not talking about them being mutually exclusive i was talking about the slight of hand that the media is trying to play here she made a ridiculous statement in the garb of talking about peace and somehow if you call her out on her ridiculous statement you are being a bully or not want peace or as per some quint video threatened by this woman speaking her mind you see the slight of hand it is not that she talking about peace was wrong or anybody ridiculed her for it people are up in armswhich btw i am against this just gives more media coverage to a silly statement because of the other bullshit she said with the call for peace
india,not_removed,why talk peace when pakistan did not do it war did it being friends with musharaff is fine please call the gentleman and ask opinion on musharaffs professional call on kargil looks like people who work in corporate world regurgitate the word professional to mean no emotions i backstab you and am professional about it

india,not_removed,i dont think so liberals in muslims are in very low number compared to others and if sangh proposes anything i am assured that others will reject it however good it is
india,not_removed,look at how salman rushdie and taslima nasreen were treated a muslim reformer who openly spoke out against sharia law and the various muslim law bodies would have umpteen fatwas declared against him her and would need vip security to survive here
india,not_removed,the bhakts as they are called will see no wrong and will abuse anybody who dares to ask questions equally rabid are the entitled leftloonies who will attack modi personally for everything thats wrong in the country it is very difficult to stay centered when the polarisation is so severe to extend that when you take a centred view it will invariably be perceived as either bhakti or loonyism depending on the beholders eye what i see as a medium to long term danger to india is that we dont have a third option its either bjp or bust there has to be a safety net that ensures that even if we decide to boot modi the country will not fall back into the hands of congress scum loksatta party has bowed out aap has fucked up its own case and there have been no new political movements since we need the likes of rajagopalachari and minoo masani to bring out a new swatantra party

india,not_removed,what after modi years or years at the max under modi bjp wont be as strong after him
india,not_removed,that too bjp has a good internal mechanism so they might find someone that comes close to modi but he wont have the public presence of modi thats why we need a third party to come up as a viable option to bjp itself

india,not_removed,juggernaut turned the page how does one describe juggernaut books a publishing house a book store a conversation with the chief executive officer ceo and cofounder of the digital publishing house durga raghunath reveals how much more business sense it makes to think of the firm as the latter which is not just selling original writing but also reselling books from other publishers creating a fuller experience for someone visiting the app juggernaut books which went live with its application in april has not yet been a game changer in the indian bookpublishing segment but it is certainly treading new ground in an otherwise riskaverse industry juggernaut was founded in september by raghunath former zomato senior vicepresident growth and chiki sarkar after she quit as publisher and editorinchief of penguin random house india along with senior editors nandini mehta r sivapriya and jaishree ram mohan with a core funding of crore its investors included infosys cofounder nandan nilekani fabindias william bissell and boston consulting groups managing director neeraj aggarwal ahead of the launch sarkar had spoken to mint about her reasons for heading in a new direction an average book sells copies at a price point of we bend our backs break our backs making these great books and what happens at the end of it very few people read it according to raghunath sarkar noticed a behavioural shift with the number of readers on the smartphone growing sarkar who is on leave was not available for comment unlike traditional publishing in which physical just gets dumped on the digital platform raghunath says she felt there was always an opportunity to do something original for digital behaviour—for the publisher the reader and the writer who feels less intimidated by the shorter length of writing preferred in this format—and most importantly to get a new audience a lot of print was getting repurposed for digital i felt can we do something with an app that will make people who spend disproportionate amounts of time on the smartphone read books says raghunath unlike movies for reading you set aside time you treat it with too much respect so thats the thing im trying to remove you dont have to set aside time stop treating it with so much respect boom dive into it in eight months she says people have downloaded the app with their recent desktop launch adding another users there have been approximately transactions or add to carts with the classics nonfiction short stories and lovesexromance fuelling juggernauts growth this is pretty evident on the home page of this stylishly designed and easytonavigate app which usually has special offers on short stories and attempts to draw readers into its popular erotic shortfiction list with tantalizing cover images of actor sunny leone in fact leones was one of the very first books to be published by juggernaut and her books continue to be the sole authordriven bestsellers on the app durga raghunath cofounder of juggernaut books at her office in shahpur jat new delhi the classics on the other hand are mostly available for free in a bid no doubt to enhance the book store experience typically if i remember right is a decent book store and would be a large book store so now with books you can call us a decent book store says raghunath interestingly she reveals that people have responded less to individual books or authors even if it is a bestselling writer like william dalrymple or twinkle khanna and more to offers and discounts within categories—the one exception has been leone people are like if this is a store i want to see a variety she says even so while khannas recently released collection of short stories the legend of lakshmi prasad has already sold copies—and she has a very urban readership unlike say a rujuta diwekar whose fitness books have a more widespread appeal—juggernaut had a stroke of luck having published the only available biography in english of the late tamil nadu chief minister j jayalalithaa by the journalist vaasanthi amma jayalalithaas journey from movie star to political queen—the madras high court had earlier restrained penguin from publishing vaasanthis more comprehensive biography jayalalithaa a portrait while the juggernaut team believes it can target a large untapped audience other mainstream indian publishers havent yet shown any urgency in jumping into the smartphone segment preferring a digital strategy that makes their books simultaneously available both in print and a slightly cheaper ebook format kapish mehra of rupa publications says this also involves making sure they can make their books available across the globe since the diaspora audience is very wide in the next few months he will be experimenting with reaching out to nonconventional readers though he says he is not at a liberty to reveal plans at the moment harpercollins india has no such plans will harpercollins have its own app maybe not says ananth padmanabhan ceo harpercollins india as reasons for this decision padmanabhan cites everything that juggernaut is attempting to crack from the low pricing structure the long catalogue that is required with customers needing to be offered new books all the time and at speedy intervals to the convenience of the interface which can make or break a readers relationship with the application one of the main concerns of course is pricing and the mindset that books on the electronic media should be available cheap or for free padmanabhan has preferred to concentrate on making harpercollins indias list of books published this past year available to readers on as many platforms as possible while harpercollins books are offered to ebook vendors some childrens books and harlequin romance titles are also being made available on the juggernaut app any discounts of course come from the seller raghunath says she was curious to explore if one she could get readers to pay for digital content and two if she could make books economically viable in what she considers an overpriced market juggernaut has chosen to price several of its short stories for as little as or is a sweet spot the moment it goes over we see a huge dip in sales in this digital business when we are trying to build a habit it would be stupid to price it over that she says in a segment where juggernaut is competing less with other publishers and more with utilitydriven apps like say uber the key is to find ways to continuously build a relationship with the reader with phones people uninstall apps a lot so you have to stay relevant and useful says raghunath so besides making sure that there are daily offers newsy nonfiction and shorter reads juggernaut will launch its submissions and writing platform on january it believes this will activate a larger audience than just readers fundamentally raghunath says people want to write and i think theres a submissions problem also to be solved in the book publishing industry can we democratize publishing was the other thought—that you dont have to know a chiki sarkar to be published so whether its short stories essays long form cookbook or poetry people can choose to publish through this section and once it starts doing well juggernaut will repackage the book give the writer a contract—basically take it to the second level this is exactly how mainstream publishers zero in on commercially successful books from the selfpublishing platform juggernaut is attempting to concentrate the activity on its platform by building a community of readers and writers by march juggernaut will also have started its hindi publishing segment the next fiscal then would probably be concentrated on stabilizing the platform from getting the content list right to reexamining the model of content acquisition—upfront cost has to be low you have to talk about revenue share the risk has to be spread wider than it currently is—and raising more funds and continuing to seek answers to the fundamental question they started with i dont know whether we have as yet come up with a digital genre that is very originally digital it would be wonderful to do that says raghunath the juggernaut timeline ■this digital publishing platform cofounded by durga raghunath and chiki sarkar went live with its application in april with over titles ■the app aims to change reader behaviour and has been downloaded by consumers the launch of its desktop version has added another consumers ■classics short stories newsy nonfiction and romance and erotica have primarily driven its growth ■in january juggernaut will launch its writings and submissions platform through which it will publish manuscripts submitted on its app books that do well will be repackaged and sold version function i post the articles text as a comment if the website is adblocker unfriendly powered by httpsgithubcomcodelucasnewspaper
india,not_removed,do i have free speech india has never had free speech we have section of crpc sections the of ipc parts of it act
india,not_removed,remember folks if your friend cant use logic in a debate its modis fault
india,not_removed,am i living in a fascist society now yes😂 do i have free speech no😂 i cant even criticize the government anymore ofcourse you canbut whod take you seriously😂
india,not_removed,poo in loo pajeet not on reddit सुबह सुबह आ गए हगने reddit पे। you took all the typical traits that a liberal sees in a bhakt and created your very own imaginary bhakt friend using those traits who discussed about sedition laws probably on eve of diwali with you such intellectualism अच्छा तरीका है karma बढाने का।
india,not_removed,so your friend used his free speech to call you antinational and you cant stomach that what the fuck he cant even have a conversation about a friend anymore he cant even criticise you is this the reality hes living in does he have to constantly carefully tread into the treacherous waters of safespaces in every conversation is he living in a fascist society now does he have free speech he cant even criticize a friend anymore
india,not_removed,i told him that bjps efforts of the economy hasnt being amazing proving it through stats you used the links i posted in your earlier thread didnt you
india,not_removed,free speech has some limits now i cant call you or some govt official politicians motherfucker behanchod in the name of free speech
india,not_removed,do i have to constantly carefully tread into the treacherous waters of safespaces in every conversation i cant even criticize the government anymore just stop with the drama
india,not_removed,fuck sedition laws it is not only from our colonial past its from our monarchical past
india,not_removed,i cant even have a conversation about the government anymore i cant even criticise it from your description it seems you did discuss about the government and criticised it if it makes you feel any better your friend resorting to personal attacks indicates that he has no valid arguments against your points you won the debate yay the problem here seems to be not lack of free speech but lack of openmindedness on your friends part
india,not_removed,these are the reasons we would never have a george carlin or louis ck
india,not_removed,section promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion race place of birth residence language etc and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony boy those cow protectors are breaking law alright
india,not_removed,does any country in the world have free speech or are you talking about antihate speech laws
india,not_removed,😂
india,not_removed,the problem is he got called anti national for supporting free speech
india,not_removed,i did further research
india,not_removed,now i cant call you or some govt official politicians motherfucker behanchod in the name of free speech sad but true i hope we have absolute freedom of speech
india,not_removed,you example is not an example of free speech it is example of derogatory defamation free speech in this context is sharing of view on state of things and discussion on it that is what all philosopher and thinkers have been doing since we learned to express ourself
india,not_removed,motherfucker behanchod so im a criminal right
india,not_removed,different countries have different levels us is probably one of the best it was even better before but its still good even now india is really far behind
india,not_removed,😂 i dont even know why were laughing any more
india,not_removed,no matter how harsh or aggressive the topic or the organization is as long as you dont start a riot free speech is free speech
india,not_removed,does that include the right to incite religious violence verbal bullying etc
india,not_removed,sharing of view on state of things and discussion on it although i agree that sedition laws should be modified and diluted you would agree that bharat tere tukde honge inshallah inshallah is not sharing a view on state of things and discussion neither is calling the highest court of the land a kaatil of a convicted terrorist
india,not_removed,but if i cant criticise the government or my criticism is not protected ie silenced then that is the violation of free speech right
india,not_removed,according to ipc yes you are
india,not_removed,no but if you say these words to me then i might become one sir
india,not_removed,are you in the us because i expected that reply lol americans have this weird we are the only country with true free speech circlejerk going on
india,not_removed,😂 everyones laughing just go with it or itll be awkward
india,not_removed,yes it is not like this do not happen just that powerful people get away with saying anything and normal people like you or me have to watch our words because we are not the one having power over our police so better give this right to anybody and everybody it goes without saying that it does not mean that there are no consequences what so ever you make a statement and it lead to actual damage to a person or an organization they should have the right to file a civil law suit against them but you should not be thrown in jail just because you said something that hurted someones feelings or someone elses ego as was the case with people thrown in jail for making soniamanmohan jokes
india,not_removed,merely inciting violence isnt really grounds for prosecution that is not how the courts interpret it anyway
india,not_removed,i totally agree with you but see you need to look at the graph these cases who say so i agree many more may think so but we are talking about speech are either less than or outlier we as a people should let our decisions be polarized by these outliers
india,not_removed,no i am not currently in the us america has one of the best free speech laws in the world it got destroyed some after but it still is very good lol
india,not_removed,just off the top of my head maya kodnani is in jail for inciting mobs i am sure there are plenty others
india,not_removed,gandhi was a sole outlier before he amassed an army of nonviolent protestors when you have people within your own nation defending such people and such acts with fervor you cannot ignore the potential problem which such outliers might cause further a bad act necessitates a law to combat it no matter how small again i may not agree with the implementation of the existing sedition law but i do believe that we cannot simply do away with it stricter measures to prevent misuse is the right way out
india,not_removed,because it lead to violence and she directly helped the mobs locate their targets merely inciting violence without any actual violence comes under free speech according to the interpretation of our courts
india,not_removed,i think she went around with those people lead them she was at the scene of the crime she was handing out swords she was also in regular communication with the police officials cms office through the day as she was driving around in naroda also she is out on bail post conviction enjoying herself in jungle raj i think
india,not_removed,merely inciting violence without any actual violence comes under free speech according to the interpretation of our courts so it depends on whether the people i am inciting actually get incited or not
india,not_removed,maybe maya kodnani wasnt the best example so now onto things that are not off the top of my head the supreme court has held that an accused can only be found guilty if he or she displays mens rea or a guilty intention the intention to cause disorder or incite people to violence is the sine qua non of the offence under ipcs section and the prosecution has to prove the existence of mens rea in order to succeed the sc laid down i think that is pretty clear sc does consider incitement of violence a culpable offence
india,not_removed,haha yes our sc has a liberal outlook when it comes to free speech many get away with trying to restrict our free speech is because most dont have the resources to take it to courts there is a documentary on aap and the election campaign in varanasicant recall the name cbfc refuses to certify that documentary because it says it is incendiary and disturbs the fabric of the society why is it ok for politicians to spew hatred in public but not ok to film it and show it the makers of the documentary are approaching the courts and i am pretty sure that the courts will direct the cbfc to certify it
india,not_removed,intent should be the relevant thing you said something someone got incited you shouldnt be culpable as long as you didnt say it to incite violence if your intention was to incite violence then you should be culpable however i would assume that indian laws are far stricter than that
india,not_removed,haha yes but then it seems like effective incitement to violence is really a ground for persecution
india,not_removed,how do you establish intent
india,not_removed,do you consider advanis speech to be an effective incitement i am trying to have a discussion dont answer if you arent interested
india,not_removed,you present your arguments in court and the judge decides i would presume past statements actions after the statement etc would be presented as evidence of intent quite similar to how it works with firstdegree seconddegree murders manslaugther etc not a lawyer

india,not_removed,this is continuation of their policy of coopting historical icons that were antagonistic to their philosophy theyve already done that with patel the man banned rss ffs and ambedkar this one went further and railed explicitly against not just rss and hidutva but hinduism in general as an instrument of oppression of dalits its election time in up so its buddhas turn the man would have been proud of how far hes come if he was alive edit ram was a parochial regressive lout compared to the buddha period ftfy buddha was one of the progressives of his time but even by the standards of his own time ram was a regressive lout as can be seen by the criticisms heaped on him for his dastardly acts like killing vali in a cowardly fashion not standing up for his wife etc by some of the characters in the epic

india,not_removed,if you read history youll also understand that this action was very much in line with pragmatic progressivism of buddha remember he was a royal and used his lineage to propagate his views he was the one who went around breaking down caste and occupational boundaries till he encountered opposition from his patrons who were being affected by slaves joining the sangha he chose to keep the sangha intact at the cost of compromising on principles not something i would agree with but not something that makes his actions not progressive by his own time they could have been more progressive if not for his cowardicepragmatism but would have pitted the sangha against the state violence that was at the time supporting the sangha he also maintained that god was irrelevant to his philosophy and thus avoided a clash with theists youll notice how centuries later when buddhists became politically powerful their philosophers practically denied existance of god while paying lip service to buddhas agnosticism

india,not_removed,whatever people here or anywhere say your girlfriend has to evaluate how much she trusts her family to handle this in a mature manner if she thinks theyll be sensible about it she should be calm friendly and loving time will do the rest i doubt rash decisionsactions will convince them of your long viability
india,not_removed,tbh you and your gf have to decide between elopement and breaking up trying to convince her parents is a risky and fruitless endeavor your dad from vhp has a greater chance of agreeing because he might see it as a ghar wapsi for the girl

india,not_removed,come to bombay with her
india,not_removed,postpone the meeting by few weeks give some solid reason in the meantime her dad will talk with her about what all is going on in his mind just try to get as much information if you try to rush anything at this point in time then there will be quick responses so take everything slow also try to meet in public next time with your friends seating on second tables also i guess you should start to think about how much committed you two are to this relationship its going to affect not just you two but your friends and families also in ways that is really hard to imagine for you at this point in time
india,not_removed,op and people must understand that islam does not permit the muslim woman to marry outside of faith while men are allowed to marry woman of other faith and bring them into the fold of islam i read your post yesterday and tried replying to it through my throwaway but i believe the reply was caught in the filter rislam so called bastion of moderate liberal islam on reddit holds the following opinion of your issue some comments from the thread i have posted ive read that one of the reasons is that if a muslim man marries a women regardless of three religions allowed she is promised certain rights by the quran such as the right to divorce and other things if a muslim woman marries a man of another faith she is not promised certain rights by that mans religion which can be very troublesome for her make sense because women are supposed to differ to the husband on issues of religion meaning shed have to allow her children to be lead down an incorrect path just cause god said so if the family of the girl permits this union theyd essentially be violating the the rules established by allah and therefore will be stigmatized by the muslim society

india,not_removed,first of all why are you marrying any girl of some other religion its just an un necessary trouble and headache and will be everyday of the future when you take into account all the people that are going to be involved but if you have to marry inter religion then you both need to think carefully if your love is greater than your religion and your respective families if it is then only do this and do it by leaving your religion and families behind and starting a new life somewhere else more over you both realise that you guys are both doing things forbidden in your religion so you are making the choice to be atheist on a big level why not just go all the way and leave your primitive practices for good

india,not_removed,after i got my first salary fom my first job in gurgaon i suddenly decided to visit my native place in the hurry i boarded the train and then realized that i forgot my purse i had planned to give the penalty there was a muslim tt whom i avoided by hiding in washroom once i assumed that the checking is done i quietly sat in a corner nearby the washroom and the entrance door reading a book the tt caught me and i explained the situation even showed my joining letter appreciation letter from my immediate boss and my home address in a id card he not only gave me his seat sideberth at the end of the coach but also gave me some money to reach home in the morning he even bought me a tea and told me to help another person in need
india,not_removed,a year kid kept on asking for tai de do give tea from every vendor that passed our berth
india,not_removed,had a bunch of blind visually impaired friends and an anglo indian mother and son duo those guys were amazing they had a great sense of humor pulled pranks on each other all the time sang really well and were at the top of their careers working in various banksinsurance companies the anglo indians were a jolly bunch too they whipped out an expensive bluetooth speaker bo ₹ and we had an amazing music party in the compartment sharing jokes experiences anecdotes and food it sucked when we parted ways at mumbai i really miss those guys we even exchanged phone numbers and made plans for outings all this in a hr journey definetely obe of my best train memories
india,not_removed,empty coach
india,not_removed,sweetest memory this was my second time travelling train i was in sixth class we got into the train found a seat at the next stop a couple came with their two kids one was little and other was the most beautiful girl i ever saw at that time i was travelling with my aunt so the elders started usual conversation which i didnt give attention to this was the first time i was feeling butterflies in my stomach so my aunt asked her to tell her name she didnt respond her mother told her that she cant speak then they had conversation about how this and that her real mother died few years ago when she was a child her aunt then married her father i felt so sad for her ive never seen so much innocent and beautiful girl again in my life although she was with her family she seemed alone and lost in her thoughts i wanted to take her and run away but at the next stop they left
india,not_removed,i have a funny incident i was sitting on the top berth with my feet hanging out in the aisle a man walked underneath and his wig got entangled with my toes and came off he kept on walking but soon realized what had happened my father had to apologize to the man and we gave him his wig back
india,not_removed,once i drank myself to oblivion with a group of enthusiastic football fans while travelling from brighton to london and it was only in the morning
india,not_removed,wonderful story
india,not_removed,that is cool
india,not_removed,a long time back i travelled by train on goa mangalore route during monsoon coach was empty and views were scenic coach was drenched but what fun it was

india,not_removed,underrated comment

india,not_removed,doh touche
india,not_removed,some of us feel that hermione should have been shipped with harry instead of ron because of the loser that he is but it looks like jkr had decided this at the time of writing the first book itself
india,not_removed,it is time that women and men are treated with respect and dignity and not as mere statistics in the sterilization program its interesting how people become so focussed on one particular issue that they become blind to everything else i very much deplore the barbaric acts being practiced in the name of population control but i also wonder if these activists have given any thought to the miserable conditions a kid lives in when it takes birth in a poor family these folks are in such a dire situation that they underwent sterilization for few dollars they would never be able to give a kid the upbringing it deserves agreed forced sterlization is not the way to go next question is what is
india,not_removed,yay more people 😑 they are implying as if the government is forcing them to snip it its entirety mandatory we need to funnel more money into the program for safety and professional care not the opposite
india,not_removed,the problem was in the implementation if it is voluntary people are informed as to the risk benefit as best as possible and there is some relative macroeconomic benefit to the initiative which there is then the ability to choose for themselves should be extended to people unfortunately most indians today have no macroeconomic perspective when deciding on policy matters this is a commonality between us and other developing and undeveloped countries as well as political reactionary demographics in fully modern societies our decisions are far more likely influenced by sensibilities and tradition than investment toward a national interest and many ngo pander to this behavior now we are left with little tangible means to incentivize smaller families where it is helpful like other reforms scrapping the idea altogether without any comparably effective alternative proposition ready for implementation is a hasty patchingup of a problem without any forethought or future planning the cycle will repeat itself something doesnt work as intended nobody takes responsibility the situation reaches crisis level mass protest erupts goi patches the issue as hastily as possible until the brink of further disaster when we can expect another patch along the path of least resistance in europe and east asia there exists a strong congruence between future macroeconomic interest and ethical sensibilities they are proactive in planning to manage future risks in my estimation this seems the single greatest factor that separates societies that are always developing from the ones that will represent the fully modern moreso than education poor infrastructure systems intelligence even malnutrition because those are fundamentally engineering problems and they can be resolved with relative ease convincing a large population to change its mindset and centuries old tradition is an order of magnitude greater difficulty
india,not_removed,this is the one single policy that we needed to execute efficiently and discretely and we have failed it too such policies need a certain level of discretion in their implementation and its best to avoid any outside attention or emotional reactions more so in a deeply rooted religious society as ours once its all carried out successfully the emotional and humanitarian folks and everyone can bask in the beneficial outcomes our unhygienic sterilization practices have raised domestic and worldwide flak since the and its very unfortunate that the sc is now forced to call it off altogether what other official stand can it take once this goes out of practice and has developed a negative public sentiment it will not be touched again by any future government which truly really sucks i really wish the sc had voted for pumping in more money equipment and human resource here rather than order a shutdown edit fixed wording
india,not_removed,you can call me whatever you want to for saying this this is a terrible decision some people are having children and are in extreme poverty and their children suffer malnutrition and nothing or very little to feed so these children live in poverty for rest of their lives and cant get a job or illiteracy or even live a normal life because of extreme malnutrition the circle of multiple childrenmalnutritionilliteracypoverty continues so we are left with huge population in poverty illiteracy disease never ending problems
india,not_removed,this is akin to human rights violations i understand there are problems with population but education and not sterilization is the answer
india,not_removed,this is a ill informed decision by sc camp based approch is necessary in world countries where in villages we hv no surgeon no anesthesiologist no after care and no electricity sometimes i hv been incharge of such many camps and i can assure u that there is no element of force or money involved our staff do lot of councelling and they prepare candidates for such op camp based approch is accepted and very successful approch for world countries it is formulated by experts of who and we only follow there latest guidelines rest assured that medial profession always is up to date and followed latest best practices of world this type of decision are bound to come when court act as expert of every field

india,not_removed,sc judges need to make a reddit account
india,not_removed,agreed forced sterlization is not the way to go next question is what is why do people have so many children despite being poor one we as humans want to continue our progeny it is in our nature as a species when you are in a situation in which it is or in recent memory has been common to lose one or more children for myriad reasons you will have more children to compensate so one solution increase family planning and health spending the latter has been lacking for decades secondly people have children for economic reasons if you work in an office you likely see children as expenses it costs money to feed them properly clothe them respectably educate them etc and indirect opportunity costs of having to spend time and energy raising them as opposed to focusing on your career and sanity if you are a farmer manual labourer small artisan of any sort you see children as income after they stop being toddlers your children can be put to use in the fields at home in the workshop or store etc solution economic growth just as a large electronics store owner does not feel the need to get his children to work to marginally increase his income a wealthier poor will feel less need to have many income positive kids additionally as people educate and move into manufacturing and service jobs they will again start to see more children as a burden and not income initiatives like family planning and health education help to drive home these basic incentives if youve gotten wealthier over the last couple years and other factors i mentioned the lessons a random health worker has for you will make a lot more sense much more quickly than if you were guided by your short term needs so in short what you need is a lot of time this isnt an overnight process as idiotic and draconian measures like forced sterilization leads one to believe edit also condoms lots and lots of appropriately sized condoms all the fun with none of the stds and kiddies
india,not_removed,exactly there is a tendency to ban things rather than properly regulate them we saw this in the surrogacy case too the right thing to do is to properly regulate them but given that we cant regulate basic traffic on the roads i think we have just assumed that nothing can be done
india,not_removed,i sort of understand what you mean about outside attention but the way to do that is to do your job well so there is nothing bad to call attention to remember that it is this sort of thing that keeps the system honest otherwise you end up with north korea style shit where everything looks good on the outside and inside people are dying population control is an earnest necessity but there are a lot of other ways to enforce it hormonal contraception condoms etc female sterilization is a surgical procedure and involves a certain amount of risk if these so called surgeons are doing it on school tables with rusty instruments without washing their hands they should be stopped immediately hopefully the money that was being given to these assholes will now be used to promote affordable contraception and education about it
india,not_removed,i came here to see this not disappointed
india,not_removed,its best to avoid any outside attention or emotional reactions more so in a deeply rooted religious society as ours why is it best to avoid outside attention managing demographics is government policy and should be openly debated and discussed especially in a democratic country if some public policy is unacceptable to the people of india why are we even doing it
india,not_removed,if it is voluntary and people are informed on the nature of the procedure whose rights are being violated
india,not_removed,what about abortion do you think abortion is human rights violation
india,not_removed,exactly and the ops post has nothing to with the ethics of sterilization we are talking only about the implementation which obviously needs fixing good practices are utmost here i agree fully too much attention is unnecessary as this is a sensitive issue obviously and its best if we stay focused and pragmatic in its implementation rather than attract unnecessary emotional or superstitious responses towards it i sure as hell cant convince our house maid against bachhe bhagwaan ki den hai shes got of those things on a monthly earning of inr with more to come next year my mum says you cant talk reason or sit to explain the benefits of sterilization to billion people a significant chunk of whom are illiterate and deeply religious
india,not_removed,i dont see a problem with voluntary camps that have high medical standards the problem here is the implementation and not the concept itself
india,not_removed,i was under the impression from the summary that the patients were given money for the procedure and didnt understand the complete ramifications of what they were doing if that isnt the case im all for it
india,not_removed,no my view was based on the fact that poor women were targeted for sterilisation i think thats unethical they need education about family planning not be targeted for sterilisation if they did it on their own accord knowing full well the consequences for their actions then i am all for it i dont think abortion has anything to do with it but no i am for abortion if done with the right intentions what about you
india,not_removed,why do you think it is retarded
india,not_removed,i agree with you and i think the individuals that have experienced damage to quality of life from some associated risk should be compensated i should say people could be informed on the attendant risks because why shut down the whole program when reform should be sufficient even if it had to be scaled down to accommodate reform as a consequence of limited budget that seems better than no solution was the opportunity cost really justifiable in scrapping it altogether rather than maintaining this tool with a more limited implementation for now i am weary of the decision because to me it seems characteristic of a disproportionate measure taken out of political expediency fear of bad press popular discontent rather than genuine concern
india,not_removed,what evidence do you have that they do not know the full consequences of their actions also the outcry seems to be about women what about vasectomies do you support that
india,not_removed,such policies need a certain level of discretion in their implementation like concentration camps death camps japanese internment camp etc in a free country like india there govt transparency should be high that is why its a retarded opinion
india,not_removed,in a way it is hard to disagree with you india needs a holistic approach to the over population issue mass sterilisation camps are just one in a number of ways this can be solved while if it was all proper and done in sanitised conditions i dont think anyone would mind but educating the people is more important and targeting minorities is wrong
india,not_removed,why do vasectomies need my support
india,not_removed,when you say free country you mean democracy i agree the citizenry need education to be a competent electorate but in india proper education isnt particularly common should we just argue people should get the government they deserve and leave it at that is there ever a circumstance where it is acceptable for policy makers to use their authority to force a researched policy clearly toward the benefit of the publics interest even if it is contrary to the general publics wishes
india,not_removed,is there ever a circumstance where it is acceptable for policy makers to use their authority to force a researched policy clearly toward the benefit of the publics interest even if it is contrary to the general publics wishes not when it involves forcible surgery on the body of an unwillinguninformed person would you meekly accept the govt forcing some sort of surgery on your body just because some bureaucrat thinks its best for you theres a difference between implementing say economic policies that many people dont like and violating their bodies

india,not_removed,infringing on other peoples right and imposing your morals on them is not ok
india,not_removed,it is also bad for elderly or people with health issues
india,not_removed,lol op i dont know how ignorant you are but you should know there are lot of things happening in the worldcountry which are bad for human health and environment and i think that firecrackers should not be responsible for more than of that badness i get the logic that one wrong doesnt justify another wrong but i am just letting you know a simple fact seeking ban on firecrackers just seems like a substandard indian professor who is more concerned with the format of the report rather than the actual content
india,not_removed,lets not burst firecrackers lets not use water in holi lets not live life with soul
india,not_removed,nnnnnnghhh i agree with you that its the worst but ban isnt the answer india waise hi bannedwagon hota jaa raha hai its bad enough i cant smoke without pandu asking me for grease adding more bans wont help
india,not_removed,bad for pets or stray animals fuck animals they bite people and shit on the streets they either belong to rural areas or they should just fucking die
india,not_removed,from next year can we have firecrackers which produce only light no sound with better consumption of the fuel gunpowder or whatever they use people who celebrate diwali will have it and people who dont want pollution will have that to a certain extent
india,not_removed,if it harms the environment and causes any kind of pollution i fully agree and support
india,not_removed,be it any occasion again please read and its certainly not ok
india,not_removed,i think there should be a rule of using instead of period p
india,not_removed,to hell with morals its actually myyourour parentsour childrenloved onesevery strangers right to be healthy to breathe clean air to live and let live if anybody fucks up those rights then i have the full right to oppose it morality would be me saying it is wrong but i used the word bad in my post in fact its a fucked up situation it becomes our duty to keep the atmosphere clean because things are already pretty bad for us pollution wise
india,not_removed,i have a right to swing my hand that doesnt mean i have the right to swing it all the way into your face bursting crackers has been shown to have a traumatic effect on animals babies old people asthmatics and heart patients to speak nothing of the environmental damage or the fire hazards it imposes on people around you without their consent its a form of enjoyment thats made possible by children subjected to hazardous chemicals and conditions that go into making those crackers nobody is saying dont celebrate diwali but celebrating diwali is not synonymous with creating a massive amount of noise i strongly doubt that the residents of ayodhya were bursting laxmi bombs and whatnot and creating a cacophony thousands of years ago which means its certainly possible to celebrate diwali without doing the same today
india,not_removed,rights are just based on what laws are implemented he is asking to exactly redefine rights so that indiscriminately polluting is not a right anymore
india,not_removed,buddy i agree the world or this country is fucked with thousands of problems i am just giving an opinion on one giving people something to think about and reason and make a serious thoughtful attempt to weed out just one of the problem if i am just able to bring about a positive change to that of badness or something that is menacing to the environment ill consider myself successful
india,not_removed,if bursting crackers spreading pollution and wasting water is actually living a soulful life according to you then sorry you certainly wont get the point there are other means spread light use the money to help and educate the poor and the needy do something good around your neighbourhood its very simple actually if you cant do anything good at least keep a checkfilter on your actions that they are not harming others in anyway
india,not_removed,bad things from our culture needs to be weeded out holi is used to assault people with water balloons diwali is used to pollute both these things are a clear invasion if right to peace and quiet and personal space and hear methods of celebration are gaudy as fuck diwali was all about lights for thousands of years it was raped by using firecrackers by utterly selfish chuts
india,not_removed,too bad i can downvote you only once people like you should have no place in the earth
india,not_removed,be it any occasion read in post
india,not_removed,everything has opportunity costs and reduced returns you should amend that statement
india,not_removed,so ban on non veg food
india,not_removed,s
india,not_removed,i am against imposing your own set of beliefs or morals on others pollution is bad year wise especially in metros banning people to celebrate a festival in a way they seem fit which is not hampering with other peoples right is not the way to tackle it participate in ngos working towards planting trees if there are none around you start one or collaborate with an existing one with this special task why should others who have equal rights as you should suffer a ban just because you didnt liked it
india,not_removed,its not okay for me therefor its not okay for anybody shut up
india,not_removed,babies old people asthmatics and heart patients to speak nothing of the environmental damage or the fire hazards it imposes on people around you without their consent good
india,not_removed,government should seriously think about banning crackers this is ops suggested alternative and in its current form according to the laws of india would be discriminatory against people who like this activity just like in his stated example of banning smoking from public places but creating special places where people can smoke that should be the way and not a complete ban i am not against any kind of reforms on this activity i am against completely ignoring other side just like bursting firecracker anywhere is an extreme a complete ban is also just another extreme and i am against this extreme i am all ears for any suggestion which allows both parties to enjoy this festival
india,not_removed,lol you know thats not gonna happen
india,not_removed,best part about diwali is animal getting tortured especially stray dogs
india,not_removed,if the scale is tipping towards the negative side when it comes to the impact on environmenthealthwellbeing you really dont have to be a genius to know which side to support can you elaborate on opportunity costs and returns you see in the given context
india,not_removed,pollution is bad year wise especially in metros that is an argument to pollute less rather than an argument for polluting more just for entertainment not all kinds of pollution are equal pollution caused by people commuting to work is bad but unavoidable controllable to an extent by public transport but still unavoidable pollution caused just because you like to hear loud noises is just frivolous go get a video of loud noises and pretty fireworks if you like them so much participate in ngos working towards planting trees thats not how the environment works planting trees is good but its not a magic spell that undoes the damage caused by pollution for one trees dont grow overnight whats more planting trees at some random place miles away from your city does nothing to counter pollution you caused in front of your house it doesnt change the fact that your asthmatic neighbor still has to breathe the results of your entertainment it doesnt change the fact that trees can handle not the several other chemical compounds and particulate matter released or the fact that those trees in the middle of nowhere arent going to do anything about the noise in your neighborhood by your logic there shouldnt be a puc check for vehicles either theres already so much pollution in cities so why should the govt try to curb peoples right to drive the most polluting cars possible people who are concerned about rising nox etc should simply plant more trees as that will solve everything
india,not_removed,when your personal freedom infringes on my right to live in a healthy environment then to hell with personal liberties i want that shit banned i have sensitive lungs i always struggle to breathe at this time of the year because of all the fireworks health is much more important than whatever freedom you are concerned about and the thing is that diwali crackers impact everyone not just me and you no one is telling you not to have a good time and celebrate but its obvious that most people dont care about the environment or the harmful impact of crackers crackers arent necessary to celebrating diwali this impacts your kids pets older people it impacts everyone living in a metro just because its bad all year doesnt make it justified
india,not_removed,banning people to celebrate a festival in a way they seem fit which is not hampering with other peoples right is not the way to tackle it i can use this argument for so many different things if i did youd call me a madman
india,not_removed,bursting firecrackers is abridgment of my right to peace and quiet how is this not clear to you
india,not_removed,most advanced countries have one official fireworks activity in a designated space and in a controlledplanned manner something on those lines would indeed be most reasonable way to do things tldr i agree with you
india,not_removed,why not maybe india will get lucky and you will get hit by a truck
india,not_removed,on the other hand dying while fucking is a pretty cool way to go p
india,not_removed,best part about mortality is that you will die
india,not_removed,ha and we wonder why india is a shit hole good job on making sure we remain a shit hole
india,not_removed,if it was not clear by planting more trees i meant in your neighbourhood not at some obscure place by your logic there shouldnt be a puc check for vehicles either so suggesting ways that could curb pollution year wise is same as allowing people to cause more pollution year wise and neither the op or you are suggesting to meet these people halfway and are just calling out for a ban on bursting crackers how is that going to help with the so called pollution levels when it is just a day out of days of an year this might be a good start to tackle this problem in a way where both parties can enjoy a festival and not just one
india,not_removed,and are these machines who are bursting crackers or actual people just like you or me these are not aliens they have equal right as that of you and i am not against having better rules and ways of handling this activity what i am against is calling a ban on an activity which just like many people have problems with many do actually enjoy too if you want to suggest better ways which would help both parties i am all ears if you want to just completely ban things sorry but that do not go well with me for starters are some good suggestions by upatharkagosht
india,not_removed,so govt should ban non veg food as it is bad for environment
india,not_removed,and that would make me a hypocrite but as far as my stand on calling ban on firecracker goes it stays the same i am not saying that things cannot be handled better but completely banning things which many people actually enjoy is not causing them any more significant harm as it is just day out of days of an year do not go well with me i am all open for suggestion on handling this activity in a better way in another thread similar to this one guy suggested to have designated areas for bursting firecrackers he also had another good idea that mucipal committeecorporation of a city should hold firecracker shows instead of people themselves burning them so the people who like can enjoy fireworks i am not completely ok with suggestion but it is better to come meet halfway instead of going my way or the highway
india,not_removed,how is this not clear to you it is clear to me but you are not the only one with rights here we are a country of billion people and they also do have rights are they bursting crackers inside your house you share this environment with many others it cannot be just your way if they are coming on your property and doing it it is wrong them doing it in the vicinity of their own house is not wrong and i am not against having some laws regarding this or better ways of handling this activity i am against complete ban that this post is asking for just like op or you or me have the right to peace and quiet many who burst firecrackers have the right to celebrate a festival they see fit credits upatharkagosht
india,not_removed,i dont get out of my house hombre
india,not_removed,hopefully someone hits you with a truck
india,not_removed,sure man ill will but the best part will be i know my efforts will have resulted in deaths of many stray dogs
india,not_removed,do you want to join me bro
india,not_removed,by planting more trees i meant in your neighbourhood not at some obscure place not a very practical choice when most neighborhoods dont have enough land to plant a lot of trees so suggesting ways that could curb pollution year wise is same as allowing people to cause more pollution year wise the logic you gave in support of crackers can be applied equally to vehicles i was merely pointing out the parallels and neither the op or you are suggesting to meet these people halfway and are just calling out for a ban on bursting crackers i missed the part where i asked for a ban on crackers care to quote the relevant section and im sorry one group is unilaterally imposing a cost on asthmatics heart patients babies animals and supporting an industry built on extremely hazardous child labor all for juvenile entertainment and its the other group that is supposed to meet them halfway regarding the designated cracker areas like a response to that link said nobody is following the sc orders that already exist
india,not_removed,im not suggesting a carpet ban have community fireworks sparklers are okay but there has to be some form of control over what can be done the current state of affairs causes massive pollution injuries and fire because of how unregulated it is just because you have the right to create pollution or dangerous situations doesnt mean that you should thats where the government should step in thats the whole reason safety and emission laws exist
india,not_removed,this such a fucking stupid comparison the types of environmental impact are completely different and incomparable stop dodging the issue by making bullshit comparisons
india,not_removed,completely right whenever i pass by a kfc i struggle to breath my lungs just cant take the pollution that theyre causing i wonder how people sitting inside eat the cruncy juicy fleshy chicken pieces seasoned with herbs and spices theyre causing so much smoke pollution much more than the crackers
india,not_removed,that guy said that municipals should do this show in a designated area so people who enjoy crackers can attend this was his only suggestion and not split into parts as you said
india,not_removed,right to peace and quiet is a fundamental right as per a karnataka hc order also i am not saying no one is saying that bursting cracker is not their right i am saying that this is an utterly selfish act and is antisocial and responsible citizens should not do it
india,not_removed,oh well one could always drive through the wall into your bedroom or you might slip and fall face first on knifes one should always be optimistic dont you think
india,not_removed,i dont think she needs defending so fuck off
india,not_removed,you are quite clearly a fucking idiot
india,not_removed,naah i would rather do my bit and try and make india a better place hopefully it will cancel out the negative stuff you do
india,not_removed,not a very practical choice when most neighborhoods dont have enough land to plant a lot of trees who says you need to create a jungle over there one house can plant a tree and if most of the houses do that it would be enough the logic you gave in support of crackers can be applied equally to vehicles i was merely pointing out the parallels which logic are you getting this parallel from i missed the part where i asked for a ban on crackers care to quote the relevant section you did in the very next paragraph its the other group that is supposed to meet them halfway now the part about this and im sorry one group is unilaterally imposing a cost on asthmatics heart patients babies animals and supporting an industry built on extremely hazardous child labor all for juvenile entertainment and its the other group that is supposed to meet them halfway this one group is not made up of some alien species or machines who do not have the same rights as the people you are quoting these people also have the rights why should there be a complete ban instead of better ways to handle this activity when the entertainment is juvenileyour words it is ok for other people who do not like to ask for a ban on it if the industry employees children then it is duty of the govt to ensure that this does not happen they are the ones collecting taxes by sale of this product they need to do their due diligence regarding the designated cracker areas like a response to that link said nobody is following the sc orders that already exist so we should not have laws because nobody followed sc orders oh shit the above line was going your way of getting to ridiculous extremes and arguing on them actual response so we should try to have better implementation of these laws and other laws which sc might pass to better ensure this festival do not become a burden on some but an enjoyment for all and moreover if people are not following orders than what is the guarantee that they would follow a ban
india,not_removed,then we both are on the same page i am against calling out for a ban on firecrackers but all in for more regulation in this matter so that both sides can enjoy a festival not just one
india,not_removed,i agree the comparison is unjust non veg food does way more damage to environment it is unjust to compare crackers with it and you stop being a hypocrite and judging issues by your convenience
india,not_removed,if you havent gone to school during childhood it is your fault its a simple school level science
india,not_removed,right to peace and quiet is a fundamental right as per a karnataka hc order never denied it but the thing that we need to understand is that it is not ok to call for ban on things we dont like nobody is saying that this is not their right but what this post is calling for is ban on this so it no longer remains a right and i am not up for it i am saying that this is an utterly selfish act and is antisocial and responsible citizens should not do it calling for a ban on things that youop dont likehave reservations against is an utterly selfish act and is antisocial and responsible citizens should not do it responsible citizens shouldand are ask for a way to meet halfway so both the parties can enjoy this festival and not just one
india,not_removed,we are doing positive stuff by getting dogs killed
india,not_removed,one house can plant a tree and if most of the houses do that it would be enough enough you have numbers to support that claim i hope otherwise it makes no sense to claim that it would be enough which logic are you getting this parallel from your own logic that working with an ngo to plant trees would be an appropriate solution to pollution presumably trees are magical entities that grow overnight and can take care of all forms of pollution you did in the very next paragraph not really i didnt advocate for a ban anywhere this one group is not made up of some alien species or machines who do not have the same rights as the people you are quoting youre right that they are not aliens and they do have the same rights too but they certainly do not have the right to basically inflict other people with the costs of their entertainment i do have the right to swing my arm but if you stop my arm from hitting your face are you denying my rights does the law against drunken driving deny peoples right to drink alcohol when the entertainment is juvenileyour words it is ok for other people who do not like to ask for a ban on it indeed some people do express that view its called freedom of expression heard of it curiously you seem to have a problem with a fundamental right despite your talk of middle grounds and rights apparently the right to burst crackers is the only right anybody can have and moreover if people are not following orders than what is the guarantee that they would follow a ban exactly why i dont advocate a ban if the fact of hazardous child labor doesnt stop people from patronizing the fireworks industry then nothing will having a ban however does make things tighter fireworks have to be produced somewhere and have to be transported elsewhere across state borders so you already have several places where the trade can be stopped people could still bribe and have black markets for this like they have for alcohol in places where thats banned but unlike alcohol crackers arent addictive and it would anyway raise the price making them less attractive again not a solution i advocate but certainly better than the laissezfaire attitude we have now
india,not_removed,fair enough
india,not_removed,im pretty sure that hazardous pollution in metros is a lot worse to people than harvesting nonveg food im open to sources disproving this though
india,not_removed,not sure about yours but all i learnt in my school is to not burn crackers as it causes pollution
india,not_removed,who is calls by for a legal ban certainly not me if there are things in our culture which are anti social it needs to be stopped i dont see why anyone needs to meet anybody halfway
india,not_removed,hardly it is a disgrace and says terrible things about us as a society also you are not just killing them you are torturing them while doing so there is nothing positive about that
india,not_removed,your own logic that working with an ngo to plant trees would be an appropriate solution to pollution presumably trees are magical entities that grow overnight and can take care of all forms of pollution it was not a replacement but an addition to what is already being done in regards to pollution neither it was my intent to suggest that this solution is enough for all kinds of pollution nor that is something that i wrote in my comments not really i didnt advocate for a ban anywhere so what is your intent when you do not want to meet people half way i am sorry if i missinterpreted this statement as my way or high way youre right that they are not aliens and they do have the same rights too but they certainly do not have the right to basically inflict other people with the costs of their entertainment and other do have a right to dictate how these people should celebrate a festival just because entertainment means different to these people we should just deny them that i do have the right to swing my arm but if you stop my arm from hitting your face are you denying my rights does the law against drunken driving deny peoples right to drink alcohol you share your environment with other people you do not share your arm with others it is unfortunate and should be handled much better but a ban is not the only solution laws against drunken driving are neither against drinking nor against driving you do not mix these two activities is what these laws are for same can be done in case of fire crackers have designated areas for people who want to indulge in this activity you burst crackers if you want to but in designated areas if you dont want to you can still enjoy your diwali as many others would indeed some people do express that view its called freedom of expression heard of it curiously you seem to have a problem with a fundamental right despite your talk of middle grounds and rights apparently the right to burst crackers is the only right anybody can have sorry i made a mistake here i should have worded it better calling for a ban on crackers is perfectly ok banning them is not exactly why i dont advocate a ban if the fact of hazardous child labor doesnt stop people from patronizing the fireworks industry then nothing will having a ban however does make things tighter fireworks have to be produced somewhere and have to be transported elsewhere across state borders so you already have several places where the trade can be stopped people could still bribe and have black markets for this like they have for alcohol in places where thats banned but unlike alcohol crackers arent addictive and it would anyway raise the price making them less attractive again not a solution i advocate but certainly better than the laissezfaire attitude we have now not something that i would support there are better ways than how we currently handle this activity and we should explore them instead of just banning things and make the whole market go underground resulting in even less control of government on these industries
india,not_removed,i am pretty sure that you do not understand anything about this
india,not_removed,who is calls by for a legal ban this is what op was demanding in his post govt should seriously think about banning crackers now who decide what is antisocial because from where i am standing many people participate in this activity socialize in the process and make new friendsi do not think this is what antisocial activities achieve so do not use buzz words for cognitive dissonance i dont see why anyone needs to meet anybody halfway in every conflict there are two sides and deciding based on just one side is not ending a conflict it is just a kneejerk reaction and would end up infringing on many peoples rights so instead of making calling out for bans govt and other authorities should look into ways which would allow both sides to enjoy this festival and not just one
india,not_removed,everything is positive about saving my fellow humans from scums of the planet
india,not_removed,what is your intent when you do not want to meet people half way i am sorry if i missinterpreted this statement as my way or high way meeting half way is possible if theres a genuine effort to change in the side thats causing the problem considering that people are busy flouting the few rules we do have and happily promoting an industry that indulges in egregiously unethical and illegal behaviour were not yet at the point where a middle ground is realistic also i dont really have a middle ground where hazardous child labor is concerned so yes i do have a my way or the highway attitude towards forcing children to work with hazardous chemicals other do have a right to dictate how these people should celebrate a festival why not the people celebrating with crackers are already dictating that their enjoyment is important and if asthmatics and heart patients and babies are traumatized then so be it they dont explicitly say so but the effect is the same why is one form of dictating okay but the other suddenly an intolerable infringement of human rights and if you must choose one to be outraged about why choose the one thats just entertainment instead of the one that involves actual physical harm btw your notion of designated areas can also be taken especially by those of a libertarian persuasion to be dictating how the festival is celebrated bear that in mind
india,not_removed,and im telling you that im open to changing my mind so instead of being condescending maybe help educate me a little bit as far as im aware of the meat industry is harmful to global warming but does not impact the particle pollution that is the major issue in indian metros am i wrong in saying this
india,not_removed,you cant disrupt the peace and quite of others in order to socialize or whatever the heck it is you are saying you have to be respectful to other citizens why is this proving to be so hard for you to understand
india,not_removed,oh the good samaritan well as a fellow human i am telling you are pathetic and there is nothing noble about it there is nothing noble about killing them so painfully you my friend are gonna rot like cancer or something i really hope you suffer too you should have a painful death
india,not_removed,i dont really have a middle ground where hazardous child labor is concerned so yes i do have a my way or the highway attitude towards forcing children to work with hazardous chemicals i think you are changing goal posts here nobody is saying that forcing children in this industry should have a middle ground we have laws regarding child labor and also regarding poor working conditions and it is never a focus of debate whether this should be allowed to continue or not what we are discussing here is whether or not bursting firecrackers be allowed or not the people celebrating with crackers are already dictating that their enjoyment is important and if asthmatics and heart patients and babies are traumatized then so be it so is tit for tat is the rule of the land or the laws should be made considering both sides and not just one why is one form of dictating okay but the other suddenly an intolerable infringement of human rights nobody said it is okay i for one from the start maintained that there should be reforms which allows people from both sides enjoy this festival and not just one the other side that this post is asking is indeed an infringement of human righst two wrongs will not make it right and if you must choose one to be outraged about why choose the one thats just entertainment instead of the one that involves actual physical harm because i believe what should stay in society and what not should be dictated by properly listening to both sides and not just one and if there is a way to allow both parties what they want then we should explore them btw your notion of designated areas can also be taken especially by those of a libertarian persuasion to be dictating how the festival is celebrated bear that in mind of course it is so is saying that if you cant breath in smoke properly not my fault there are tradeoffs for living in a civilised society this is a one that allows both parties to enjoy the festival in a way they like but with some restrictions smoking in public is a good example of this some of those who smoke might not like the idea but if we choose any of the other extremes we are necessarily are not allowing one party one of their right
india,not_removed,we have laws regarding child labor and also regarding poor working conditions and it is never a focus of debate whether this should be allowed to continue or not considering that that is the operating model of the industry in question it is certainly pertinent i do acknowledge that ignoring it makes it easier to make your argument though if their viability is based on using children theyve basically forfeited their right to exist dont you agree i dont even want to go into the rest of your argument which concerns banning or not banning fireworks as i do not advocate banning them anyway though it would be good to tax the industry to hell and beyond if people want to burn firecrackers let the externalities they impose on their surroundings at least be baked into the cost as for the dedicated firework areas good luck with that given our that our cities are so spacious and people so law abiding especially when it concerns religion
india,not_removed,i do acknowledge that ignoring it makes it easier to make your argument though yes and as for my stand on it the government should ensure that this should not happen i do not support this activity in any way but banning a product for it is something that i would not support ban a company send their managers or top level people behind bars if their viability is based on using children theyve basically forfeited their right to exist dont you agree yes the companies who are doing this should not exist but if tomorrow i want to start a firecracker factory complying with all the rules and regulations of the land i should be allowed to do banning firecrackers would not allow even people who want to comply with labor laws to not enter this industry though it would be good to tax the industry to hell and beyond that is also wrong and a proxy way of banning an item you tax them as per the norms if the industry is able to sustain this fine if not then also fine when market decides they do not want an item i have no problem as for the dedicated firework areas good luck with that given our that our cities are so spacious and people so law abiding especially when it concerns religion just because it is hard does not mean it is not worth trying
india,not_removed,as we have seen govt can pretty much do anything they want in india they are answerable only once in years
india,not_removed,yes there was limit on jan dhan account from the beginning ie rs pm
india,not_removed,yeah they can do that no questions asked government controls the rbi which has an even tighter leash on the banks
india,not_removed,i guess at some point people will probably challenge the withdrawal limits if someone has white money already deposited before there shouldnt be limits on his withdrawal like the limit right now
india,not_removed,if we are in a financial emergency or security govt can put any limit on anything they want
india,not_removed,how dare you question the supreme leader

india,not_removed,this guy created a chrome extension and the reason behind it will blow your mind
india,not_removed,bc who is sipping coffee in ccd
india,not_removed,a man has risen against the tyranny of click bait click to see how
india,not_removed,not to be cynical about this but could you clarify on the information the extension is going to read on my facebook page some privacy concerns will it access my personal details posts likes and any other things i share or watch is any of the information about the links stored in any way other than anonymously given the recent stress on spreading fake articles this is a much needed extension i have couple of suggestions if you want to work it further could you also extend it to other websites other than facebook like all the tabloid pages like buzzfeed or similar kinda websites i know that firefox is all together different but any intentions on working firefox extension i hope it reaches to recommend page
india,not_removed,found the lpm guy nice tool though thanks
india,not_removed,for easiness httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailthisisclickbaitppklhdlfnadnlnllnenceabhldpnafjm
india,not_removed,this thing works
india,not_removed,noice
india,not_removed,great job man
india,not_removed,the model is hosted on your machine where is it being scored what is your assessment of kerastensorflowtheano
india,not_removed,watch out redditors gonna get doxxed give full source code
india,not_removed,can you please shed some more light on how you labelled the data was it a blanketed labelling that all the articles from toi buzzfeed etc were made clickbait and those from hindu etc were made as nonclickbait
india,not_removed,just saw your product in ph amazing work dude making everyone proud what youve done is incredibly commendable as in the age when many products talk about ai and deep learning capabilities but are in reality far away from it yours actually uses deep learning congratulations and way to go
india,not_removed,mods should sticky this if u want to have some feedback
india,not_removed,so im saying this for everyone interested what precisely is your model and training set
india,not_removed,nice how can we extend it to other web sites
india,not_removed,so like of fb content is removed
india,not_removed,this is awesome a few questions as someone interested in deep learning just wanted to know your approach did you use nlp and tokenized the headlines into words or was it something else that tensorflow itself offered the code isnt accessible for some reason in the repository so im asking here only what were the biggest challenges you faced was it finding the type of classifier to use or configuring it and what was your mental process in making these decisions thank you so much this is an amazing piece of work
india,not_removed,thanks for doing this
india,not_removed,i installed this extension opened facebook questions that only alia bhatt couldve answered in the most coolest way this title of the article was showing as a click bait i guess it works trying other articles intense movies that will keep you glued to the screen this is not a clickbait trying more
india,not_removed,you guys liked it so much and there is just rating to this extension so far come on
india,not_removed,nice work
india,not_removed,sweet stuff mate 🤓
india,not_removed,i use safari
india,not_removed,function ka name to badal leta dude p showfacebookcvtags nice effort though very easy to milk a prize at a hackathon using this shit will send you if i win one in the ones coming up your model is also not opensource why should i even trust you
india,not_removed,wont it work on posts shared by my friends currently i can only see the rating on posts shared by umm entities like amazon i know my friends that rating ought to be there next to the shit they share
india,not_removed,thanks a lot buddy i just thinking about making something like that for youtube
india,not_removed,great any support for firefox chrome just swallows my ram
india,not_removed,thats great will try it
india,not_removed,thanks man any other projects of yours we should know about
india,not_removed,good job any plan for waterfox in coming days
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,this is a good idea however it marked a businessinsidercom page as clickbait thought you should know link
india,not_removed,show this on hacker news thats one huge group of tech savvy folks who would appreciate this
india,not_removed,omg this clickbait detecting addon is all we need click here to find out more sarcasm aside great work mate
india,not_removed,post on rchrome
india,not_removed,reasons why you shouldnt install this extension
india,not_removed,even if i know its a clickbait title it makes me urge for clicking on it
india,not_removed,its me
india,not_removed,the sixth comment will shock you
india,not_removed,as i always make sure privacy is maintained and even made a post so the only thing this tool accesses is the title of the posts on facebook using html dom and the code is even opensourced so there is nothing to worry for that case is any of the information about the links stored in any way other than anonymously nope nothing at all only with each request the accuracy of the tool increases so if more users use this the accuracy also increases could you also extend it to other websites other than facebook like all the tabloid pages like buzzfeed or similar kinda websites the reason i choose facebook is because i think thats where the major source of clickbait articles are posted and if you know that the article is clickbait from facebook itself then the problem is solved also extending to buzzfeed or other websites will make this repo difficult to maintain i know that firefox is all together different but any intentions on working firefox extension yes its submitted queue of i hope it reaches to recommend page thanks
india,not_removed,you are welcome
india,not_removed,thanks
india,not_removed,thanks you made my day edit scoopwhoop and buzzfeed will hate this tool lol
india,not_removed,yes its a ml program so it learns patterns from different data sets using tensorflow the dataset consists of about headlines half of which are clickbait the clickbait headlines were fetched from buzzfeed newsweek the times of india and the huffington post the genuinenonclickbait headlines were fetched from the hindu the guardian the economist techcrunch the wall street journal national geographic and the indian express so by learning from different data it predicts the clickbait which helps in improving the accuracy as more users use this tool the accuracy also increases
india,not_removed,hosted on heroku as i can see from the manifest just use this baseurl httpsclickbaitdetectorherokuappcomdetectheadline link and merge base link and ping to get the clickbaityness of the link
india,not_removed,thanks here is ph post for others httpswwwproducthuntcompoststhisisclickbait
india,not_removed,and what about the overfitting and underfitting
india,not_removed,answered below
india,not_removed,lol okay atib rehman sir
india,not_removed,in the works
india,not_removed,how does one make use of this though
india,not_removed,facebook does penalise clickbait articles but not the way we all want as it generates revenue
india,not_removed,your model is also not opensource he used some other dudes backend code and just make a chrome extension for it poor guy who made the backend probably hated javascript like it should be
india,not_removed,thanks ill wait for you to win then though youll not send obviously lol
india,not_removed,function ka name to badal leta dude p showfacebookcvtags mocking nice effort though very easy to milk a prize at a hackathon using this shit will send you if i win one in the ones coming up telling him that you will take the credit for this script your model is also not opensource why should i even trust you nobody is asking you to he shared the script in spite of knowing that there are assholes out there who will try to take credit for it
india,not_removed,firefox one is on its way they take time to review at queue of specifically
india,not_removed,thanks
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,yes fake news is one thing i am also working on but the problem is facts need to be cross referenced from the article content so it is a hard problem to solve
india,not_removed,clickbait comment
india,not_removed,bc
india,not_removed,username confirms
india,not_removed,dio is that you
india,not_removed,great then ill provide the feedback once i get on with it
india,not_removed,nope nothing at all only with each request the accuracy of the tool increases so if more users use this the accuracy also increases for real how have you incorporated online learning high probability there is no feedback do you mean you are just saving the headlines and increasing your training set
india,not_removed,buzzfeed hates him find out why
india,not_removed,they might still feature you thoughyou wouldnt believe what this young indian techie did
india,not_removed,not really the tech literate people who install this werent reading scoopwhoop in the first place
india,not_removed,the clickbait headlines were fetched from buzzfeed newsweek the times of india while building the dataset have you assumed all the headlines from buzzfeed and toi as clickbait
india,not_removed,i know all that dude i just wanted to know where the model is hosted because to score the model as number of users increases will be difficult on a laptop if its hosted on heroku then its good btw where can we take a look at the code which collects the data from our web browsers
india,not_removed,it would really help if you can share details about the classifier and the model you have used also did you manually tag the corpus or a blanket clickbait for buzzfeedtoihuff and genuine for hindueconomistguardian
india,not_removed,is this differentiating fake from real as well or just clickbait from headlines
india,not_removed,use dainik bhaskars fb page for hindi clickbait headlines man their whole business is clickbaiting
india,not_removed,hi op looks good where did you source the training data from did it involved manual labeling of the title vectors how do you plan to treat misclassified records for recalibrating your model cheers
india,not_removed,techcruch started using clickbaity titles in recent times
india,not_removed,open source aws type offering
india,not_removed,did you author the heroku app this is a very interesting model i wonder what classifier you may have used
india,not_removed,install the extension and go to facebook install instructions are given in github link
india,not_removed,thanks i think op shouldve credited the backend guy
india,not_removed,yes the model is opensource both of us worked together on this and we are from the same batch in my university and part of the same group collegecode so the credit is already given on my repo
india,not_removed,how would you propose to interpret the weights of the neural net anyway one does not interpret the weights of the neural net what id like to see is what the model takes as the input what is its architecture training scheme of the network if shared would also be great as itll enable other folks to try out betterperforming models with the dataset used what i propose is why not people at rindia interested in removing clickbait start a code project forming a dataset by manual labelling of clickbaity articles and then training validating and continuously improving the model would that be better than the blackbox model that we have right now i thought deep networks were inherently good for predictability but not explanation as to what the learned features mean no its not true they are a mystic ml technique for sure but there are very specific ways in which the hidden layer activations can be visualized and made sense of its a common misconception that its a complete blackbox which also often leads to its application in places where simple order heuristics also work much better deep learning is like a cheap whore every tom dick and harry uses her for personal gains and raising funds unfortunately me too p there was a quote in the first line of a readme of a dl library on github deep learning is like highschool sex everyone says they do it nobody really does and no one knows what it actually is mikettownsend
india,not_removed,karma points for originality
india,not_removed,you linked the same thing
india,not_removed,you wont believe what he said next
india,not_removed,mmm who clicks on a reddit comment
india,not_removed,i see c what you did there
india,not_removed,one will blow your mind
india,not_removed,if that is the assumption then it will affect the performance of the model
india,not_removed,uirahulkapoor can you answer this how exactly did you tag the dataset of
india,not_removed,i dont think he is an idiot
india,not_removed,the only other way is if he manually sorted through headlines
india,not_removed,btw where can we take a look at the code which collects the data from our web browsers that i think happens in the backend
india,not_removed,hosted on heroku as somebody pointed out below wrt data the looks for all elements with class mbs and sends all the a tags under them to the heroku app looking at the html facebook generates it seems quite specific and doesnt appear to leak anything else didnt verify if the chrome apps code matches githubs though
india,not_removed,i dont think manual tagging would work for headlines
india,not_removed,as mentioned fake news is one thing i am also working on but the problem is facts need to be cross referenced from the article content so it is a hard problem to solve but dont worry update will soon be available

india,not_removed,oh sorry 😐 yes more stuff is there on github profile at so you can follow me there if you want to keep track of more projects i release later this year
india,not_removed,comment will blow your mind
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,aai zhavda
india,not_removed,or blow you
india,not_removed,that i think happens in the backend nopes that is exactly and the only thing the extension does goes through the dom on your facebook page and sends the links to the backend hosted on herokuapp your other post shows you know your stuff misinterpretation of the question here
india,not_removed,you could distribute the task of manual tagging of titles as a web tool to your friends i did it for brand identification from tweets
india,not_removed,thats what i meant open source or not neural nets are pretty opaque cant wait for this deep learning wave to end yes you cannot interpret the weights individually and also cant you interpret the hyperplanes underlying a goddamn svm does that mean you stop using svms i keep hearing all these bullshit about people finding deep learning too mystical for them more often than not these are the exact bunch of fellas who havent read jack shit about deep learning prolly dont even know how connections exist in a convnet how many research papers blog articles have you read on deep learning methods and techniques that assist in understanding the underlying principles saar if your answer is less than id really suggest you go home and read the papers on basic principles and then come argue they have taken over the news and are not helping advance ai in any way joke of the decade not helping ai in anyway one faggot here at my office died laughing rofl lmao are you an oldfashioned professor at some iit all my old profs at iitb seem to have a similar opinion and the irony is they dont seem to have enough bandwidth to do literature survey of deep learning and yet have formed strong negative opinions about it they dont have papers in their areas too so its not like they are doing anything special elsewhere just find a new application throw some gpu at it and publish a paper i wish it was this simple bro id have a bunch of publications by now fun fact all papers on arxiv publications i havent gone much deep into the argument would love to but it seems your network hasnt trained yet
india,not_removed,if not then fifth one will definitely blow it up

india,not_removed,how does this radiolink thingie work the article just says what it does and the wiki article is full of jargon
india,not_removed,i have faced this a few times recently
india,not_removed,oh boy the media is at it again so much outrage without a single explanation remember during days whenever you entered a lift or basement for a short time your call dropped now in the lift you cant hear anything but the moment you come out connection reconnects again this is what it is when you establish communication you can follow nak or ack ack means i keep shouting if you do not reply i assume you are dead nak means i keep shouting even if i do not hear you only when error is received line is killed i have tried to simplify it apologies to fellow communication fellas i know this is a very crude def i am not good at so in tech terms it keeps a connection alive during temporary disruptions like cell tower out of range and in rangeeg in cars its very good in normal circumstances however its say there is a congestion and capacity issue using this does not differentiate and your connection is kept alive even though call is dropped there is a certain timeout and by making it or more you can get more money from your customers
india,not_removed,every single one of these telcos are aholes
india,not_removed,i faced this yesterday
india,not_removed,the only way out of this mess is to start using the internet massively for voice calls make sure everyone you care about has whatsapp and start calling them using that
india,not_removed,in a shocking revelation it has been found that using a technology called radiolink leading telecom companies are masking dropped calls and converting them into billable units thereby hitting two stones with one single arrow no complaint against drop calls and more revenue from billing of those calls which shouldnt have happened in a shocking revelation it has been found that using a technology called radiolink leading telecom companies are masking dropped calls and converting them into billable units thereby hitting two stones with one single arrow no complaint against drop calls and more revenue from billing of those calls which shouldnt have happened under radiolink technology the end user will keep on seeing the call as connected even if the call has been dropped disconnected abruptly due to poor network coverage telecom operators are using radiolink technology which is helping them mask call drops while the consumer is being billed for the time he is on the call although it can be said to be artificially connected to a network so instead of paying for call drops telecom firms are now earning from the ignorance of users and by fooling them here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,yes please somebody answer his question there are many people like us what tech is this
india,not_removed,airwave is an unreliable method to transfer data and external factors causes some packets to get lost for a udp connection this is ok but for tcp or any other protocol that creates a tunnel or initiates a connection before transfer packet loss is bad i mean real bad this can cause connection to collapse even if the packet loss is less than if not for this protocol or any proprietarydifferent implementation of same technique there would be dropped connection everywhere wifi sat connections anything that has anything to do with wireless this protocol just allows retransfer of dropped packets so that flow is not broken and connection is kept alive this happens all the time at local level on your device wifi network and global internet and this article looks like they just found out about it and are making up stories for articles this is necessary and this time i side with telcos because without this not even the best network will be able to keep up with connection tunnels that said a respectable carrier should acknowledge a dropped connection and gracefully end the call when there is no response for a set timeout note overly simplified and some terms are used roughly because they better fit their generic meaning but are actually technically wrong or imperfect sorry to the one who knows this stuff in and out and is cringing over this also i am not a network professional but i have learned quite a lot these days just because i am fascinated by network stuff and try to learn more things about it i dont know much about cellular networks but the above explanation is my understanding of voipnetworks and some quick research for mins which basically says it operated similarly with some differences not related to this
india,not_removed,ive had this issue long before there was anything which could be done about call drop ive also faced the problem of hearing my own voice and getting charged for it
india,not_removed,tring tring trai trai
india,not_removed,even a second timeout is ok because this happens multiple times per second in usual conditions also these days i get good call quality and signal even in elevators
india,not_removed,so its a pretty generic tech thats used everywhere but indian telcos arent disconnecting calls with dropped tunnels within optimum timeout
india,not_removed,problem privelege of hearing my own voice and getting charged for it regards team airtel
india,not_removed,dropped
india,not_removed,thats what i think the article is trying to say normally the network rotates between multiple devices each second and there are of packet sent but if the carrier is still trying to send the same packets for more than seconds even that is a bit is stretch they are doing it wrong
india,not_removed,problem privelege privilege of hearing my own voice and getting charged for it regards grammar nazi

india,not_removed,yes it did someone in midday does not know how to use photoshop microsoft paint
india,not_removed,esp considering she was in a willing live in relationship with this guy
india,not_removed,it can still be rape its pathetic how people can act like paros wali aunty over here
india,not_removed,once you are in the party circle age is no barrier
india,not_removed,when she was raped first time why didnt she go to cops most likely a relationship gone sour after girl refused to go for abortion
india,not_removed,ive actually read op mathai he worships nehru the book was banned because it was very candid about all the leaders everyone was taking money from the industrialists who was drunkard etc everyone is shown in a human light not as saintly except one person who is nehru it is a fascinating book for anyone interested in nehru or indian history i couldnt get his second book anywhere i tried v hard maybe someday
india,not_removed,even if not what has pregnancy got to do with rape you can have sex without a live in relationship too the focus here should be on sexual assault yes she has a baby and may be the congressman is the father but you can not force someone to be a father
india,not_removed,the sarcasm is strong in this one
india,not_removed,i dont know if you are trying to be sarcastic if not then wake the fuck up man there are many cases where women have accused their live in partner for rape if her partner didnt marry her or something here is your proof
india,not_removed,one could argue martial rape resulting in an unwanted pregnancy
india,not_removed,one could argue martial rape resulting in an unwanted pregnancy there was no war here a marital rape is still rape i am not sure what pregnancy has got to do with it it is kind of a diversion

india,not_removed,what media now blaming ppl for not paying attention to assam floods after their own long history of ignorance of northeast height of shamelessness
india,not_removed,im fairly certain issues and floods over various parts in the country all need our attention trying to put one over the other is just bad form and poor ethics report assam report bengaluru report gurgaon report elsewhere do your job
india,not_removed,tyranny of distance
india,not_removed,i am actually surprised to find this post here thank you op for putting this into attention honestly the flood situation has been grim for some time now and it pains to see not even a single coverage about it in the national television also the overflowing river has not only effected people and knp but has also eroded large chunks of majuli asias largest riverine island we are loosing a world heritage site here peopleand i dont understand why so little has been done so far
india,not_removed,did mp floods not need our attention people died bihar dead and counting i guess heartland does not figure in the scheme of any outrage brigade
india,not_removed,unfortunately our electronic media is extremely focused on delhi including random kejriwal publicity stunts rumors on cab fare regulation etc
india,not_removed,its the media that needs to move over from their headquarters in delhi and guragon to other states where such stories happen

india,not_removed,well every flood situation needs some attention having been in chennai last yr when the national media woke up after a week or so this time atleast they woke up sooner but still the focus needs to be across every affected area having followed news am finding it difficult to find any assam related informations

india,not_removed,no its okay to put every flood above gurgaon its not even a problem there was water in places but it cleared in a while nothing extraordinary its been the same for years didnt warrant national coverage only if there was a functioning municipal corporation
india,not_removed,actually gurugram issue is far more in our control than assam issue at least in foreseeable timeline both need attention but natural calamity feels less tragicoutrageous than man madeenabled calamity
india,not_removed,yes but he is not the one who decides what the topic of discussion is going to be he probably doesnt have much say in it
india,not_removed,now thats a useful comment
india,not_removed,are you blaming them for rain and floods
india,not_removed,any calamity is tragic regardless of the reason the end result is always the same many people dying

india,not_removed,aidstb epidemic is kind of a natural calamity which kills many hundred people daily that doesnt make into news bulletin are those deaths less tragic news value or rather debate value is more for man made calamity where we can do much more than natual calamity where we are usually helpless discussing it is far less useful if there are some steps that could be taken by government to stop yearly floods in assam and were not taken i take back my point but that basically makes assam floods man made calamity
india,not_removed,what you are saying is true but doesnt change the fact that calamity isnt more or less tragic than another whatever the cause

india,not_removed,why is this on rindia
india,not_removed,atleast theyre being investigated if this happened in india the rioters would just be propped by politicians and saved from punishment
india,not_removed,playing the victim card even when in majority this is fucked up
india,not_removed,on the way showed of bangladeshis want sharia which is higher than egypt congo and nigeria and less than pakistan more muslims in south asia believe a woman should obey her husband than the middle east and slightly less believe women should not have a choice on wearing the hijab than the middle east and of bangladeshis believe suicide bombing is oftensometimes justified compared to of pakistanis of south asian muslims believe democracy is better than a dictatorship the only reason we arent burning like me is first off we are poor and secondly hinduism i used to think south asian muslims were more liberal than arabs at the very least now i dont know only hasina is our friend which is why i was so surprised when we tried to pressure her into fighting elections bangladesh is in its honeymoon phase with jihad while the pakistanis have begun to understand what jihad does to the country it is born out of we need to keep a friendly government in bangladesh in any way possible should the jaamats supporters seize power well be left having to develop a completely new anti terrorist strategy made difficult by mountainous terrain of ne and marshy river infested terrain of sunderbans
india,not_removed,all hail saudi monies
india,not_removed,it is weird that they did not include india in that survey when there are million muslims living here they should also conduct a survey of hindus but would have to change the questions significantly i would be very interested to see the results of both these surveys
india,not_removed,india pakistan bangladesh are all getting more and more radicalized bangladesh has its jamaat e islami a deviate political organization and india has rss which is actually in power through bjp bangladesh is actually taking steps and has banned jamaat e islami from taking part in elections while in india rss has gained full power through bjp atleast bangladesh has some balls to go against these extremists while india has elected a murderer bangladesh is at least taking steps to ban religious political parities httpindianexpresscomarticleresearchwhybangladeshisexecutingjamaateislamileadersashorthistory
india,not_removed,i think they didnt do it because they didnt want to provoke tensions they also didnt survey burmese muslims although they did survey nigerian muslims plus see how funnily they word it muslim world overwhelmingly against suicide bombings oh wow of your people believe innocents shouldnt die in a brutal fashion heres a gold sticker
india,not_removed,source for rss doing suicide bombings and forcing muslims out of india please or india having a state religion relevant extracts in the international crimes tribunal indicted several jamaat members for war crimes against hindus during the bangladesh atrocities in retaliation violence against hindu minorities in bangladesh was instigated by the bangladesh jamaateislami the violence included the looting of hindu properties and businesses the burning of hindu shops and homes rape and abductions of hindu women and vandalising and desecrating the hindu temples on october the united states commission on international religious freedom published a report titled policy focus on bangladesh said that since its last election bangladesh has experienced growing violence by religious extremists intensifying concerns expressed by the countrys religious minorities the report further stated that hindus are particularly vulnerable in a period of rising violence and extremism whether motivated by religious political or criminal factors or some combination the report noted that hindus had multiple disadvantages against them in bangladesh such as perceptions of dual loyalty with respect to india and religious beliefs that are not tolerated by the politically dominant islamic fundamentalists of the bnp violence against hindus has taken place in order to encourage them to flee in order to seize their property the previous reports of the hindu american foundation were acknowledged and confirmed by this nonpartisan report prime minister khaleda zia while leader of the opposition in declared that the country was at risk of hearing uludhhwani a hindu custom involving womens ululation from mosques replacing the azaan muslim call to prayer eg see agencefrance press report of november bangladesh opposition leader accused of hurting religious sentiment i acknowledged hasina is a friend didnt i i just dont believe the bangladeshi people are our friends they hate us they kill their own people who they perceive to be indians because of their own religion and they would gladly slaughter us if they had the ability to do so the government might win a few battles here and there but its losing the war when happened we should have kept or so troops permanently stationed in bangladesh like the europeans and americans did in but we thought they were our friends and here we are murderer unsubstantiated and unrelated heres something substantiated and related jinnah was a genocidal maniac and mohammad raped children says a lot about their followers no
india,not_removed,i think they didnt do it because they didnt want to provoke tensions i thought so too and i dont know what makes me sadder that there are people who would take advantage of the situation to whip up religious tensionfrom both sides or those who would rather bury this information and continue to pretend that there are no problems in that community muslim world overwhelmingly against suicide bombings not sure where you found this phrase i admit i havent read the entire report but only skimmed the numbers but in general there is what is called as bigotry of low expectation coined by bill maher against the community take ucc and triple talaq all the governments have to really tip toe and fear how the community will take the introduction of a secular law and changes to the constitution though once again the phenomenon is more applicable in the west than in india where everyone is at least equally intolerant and ignorant edit punctuation
india,not_removed,since this thread has been removed there is no point wasting my time replying to rss supporters their reality is known to everyone on october the united states commission on international religious freedom lets use the same organisation for indian report india denied visa to them the annual report of uscirf documents and categorises countries based on their religious freedom record in the report had criticised india and had named bjp and affiliated bodies incidents of religiouslymotivated and communal violence reportedly have increased for three consecutive years the states of andhra pradesh uttar pradesh bihar chattisgarh gujarat odisha karnataka madhya pradesh maharashtra and rajasthan tend to have the greatest number of religiouslymotivated attacks and communal violence incidents nongovernmental organizations ngos and religious leaders including from the muslim christian and sikh communities attributed the initial increase to religiouslydivisive campaigning in advance of the countrys general election since the election religious minority communities have been subject to derogatory comments by politicians linked to the ruling bharatiya janata party bjp and numerous violent attacks and forced conversions by hindu nationalist groups such as rashtriya swayam sevak sangh rss and vishva hindu parishad vhp the report had said now you go in denial writing nonsense to defend these guys i will save my time and not reply to you
india,not_removed,muslims around the world strongly reject violence in the name of islam asked specifically about suicide bombing clear majorities in most countries say such acts are rarely or never justified as a means of defending islam from its enemies in most countries where the question was asked roughly threequarters or more muslims reject suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilians and in most countries the prevailing view is that such acts are never justified as a means of defending islam from its enemies what really worries me is the who believe they are justified in krygyztan if decades of soviet atheistic indoctrination couldnt solve that i wonder if it can ever be solved funnily enough the one country where id say muslims do have legitimate and recent grounds for religious hatred bosnia herezgovina only believe suicide bombings are justified sucks how they were the ones who had to face the worst that has been done to any muslim community in ages
india,not_removed,yep they were scared also didnt survey ksa probably because thatd have massively skewed the data toward extremists side its funny they have been as biased as possible but they still cant really save the communitys face
india,not_removed,kahan ka chutiya hai re you said you wouldnt replythen replied since the election religious minority communities have been subject to derogatory comments by politicians linked to the ruling bharatiya janata party bjp and numerous violent attacks and forced conversions by hindu nationalist groups such as rashtriya swayam sevak sangh rss and vishva hindu parishad vhp the report had said violence against hindus has taken place in order to encourage them to flee in order to seize their property the previous reports of the hindu american foundation were acknowledged and confirmed by this nonpartisan report the violence included the looting of hindu properties and businesses the burning of hindu shops and homes rape and abductions of hindu women and vandalising and desecrating the hindu temples spot the difference ill tell you anyway realsfeels branding all opponents as raw agents rss agents looks like you have taken quiet a few leafs out of pakistans book i didnt call you an aimim supporter because i understand nuancethough you might very well be one seeing as how determined you are to excuse rapes and murders when done by your community also no comeback on the child rape and genocide thing is it because there isnt one not that its any of your business but im not a rss agent since you are new here i doubt youd seen me but i used to post a lot before on a different account back then i met people like you except these people were trying to justify the entire christmasgood governance controversy or beef ban with what pakistan does in case it still isnt clear they were arguing with me its funny how similar the two extremes are no understanding of moderates and only hatred devoid of logic
india,not_removed,in most countries where the question was asked roughly threequarters or more muslims reject suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilians means that roughly believe in violence and seeing as islam is the second biggest religion and also the fastest growing one the numbers are staggering and enough to inflict untold damage httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpspvnfddqhk it is based off of the pew research you linked and adds context and heft to sam harris argument in the

india,not_removed,fascism states misuse of power is becoming so regular that we are getting used to it
india,not_removed,til the indian govt prefers that vulnerabilities are sold off in secret
india,not_removed,im interested in knowing his reasons for thinking why its vulnerable is this personal technically sound enough or is this just heresay
india,not_removed,in his article mr kochhar has claimed that the aadhaar ecosystem is flawed vulnerable has very poor security and can be easily hacked he has also written that india is being taken for a ride by those with vested interest on aadhaar enabled payment he has further stated that the national security is at stake the uidai discussed the matter with its legal team and it was decided that the article and the video was in violation of the aadhaar act the police said that they have registered a case however no arrest has been made so far i feel sorry for all those software companies having to actually patch vulnerabilities its really a pity they cant threaten all those who reveal vulnerabilities
india,not_removed,shame india was blazing a progressive trail with a very pronet neutrality rulebook as given by trai a year ago i hoped that it was a sign of a broader progressive mindset towards integrity and accountability but it may have been isolated to just a good trai chairman and not indicative of the wider system
india,not_removed,this nation is truly going to the dogs
india,not_removed,the painful thing is this strategy of targeting individuals works now any private citizen will think a hundred times before writing any critical piece on uidai
india,not_removed,what did the guy do someone post link pls
india,not_removed,terrible idea to silence critics in a democracy they went after ngos that found fault in government programs and now this
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,from what i have heard most white hat hackers contact the company in question first when they find a vulnerability only after the system has been patched do they publish the issue
india,not_removed,who will be laughing when someone files a pil against uidai
india,not_removed,what you plebs dont know is that this bug was knowingly left behind to flush auntinationals like these what a masterstroke by uidai
india,not_removed,no it system is secure and same is the case with aadhar but why filing firs against people who point this out shooting the messenger wouldnt it make sense to ask those people what vulnerabilities they found and work upon them maybe even reward them so that more people help uidai to find bugs something like big software companies in world do if vulnerabilities are real they will be exploited sooner or later how many people will you put in jail man i have lost total trust in whatever projects govt works on and uidai is a big ass one i dont know what demented folks run the show now put me in jail for saying this
india,not_removed,developer wale desh me tester ki koi jagah nahi
india,not_removed,i havent read that article yet but the aadhar act of does have a for leaking information or unauthorized access to their database the author might have done this with good gesture but the leaking information clause is tricky as they can put charges on him for revealing just about any technical information about aadhar edit though one can argue that putting the said clause is itself contradictory to the progress of information technology aadhar process itself comes under it precedents could be given in the court about the various hacks in the history of internet and how opening up the technical process contributes to the hardening of security system but only lawyers with sane understanding of technology can argue that and i dont think there are many in our indian courts
india,not_removed,nationalism bro the editor must be a terrorist sympathizerthats the countrys narrative now
india,not_removed,lauh lauh everywhere
india,not_removed,if you read the article in the first line it says that it is because the person is spreading rumors if someone finds a vulnerabilities in a system it is generally expected of him to disclose it to the developer before disclosing it to the public if he does not do this and tries to spread the information without basis then it might be a case of malicious intent
india,not_removed,i am searching for the original article by the fir accused as well but no results perhaps in the name of journalistic ethics the article should be cited as well
india,not_removed,the video is in there as well
india,not_removed,depends on how the vulnerability was exposed if you expose an fb vulnerability to the public youre ass will be sued go to the developer
india,not_removed,its not a vulnerability its a feature
india,not_removed,read the article and see if you can take it seriously not justifying the arrest obviously
india,not_removed,read his article and judge for yourself
india,not_removed,the article isnt clear and i couldnt find the video so far did he do a poc or was it just talking
india,not_removed,dogs cows
india,not_removed,they will post anonymously but yes they also screwed some researcher who found flaws with the evms
india,not_removed,what if the vulnerabilities are purposefully built in to exploit what if its not a bug but a feature a feature government doesnt want you to know you would want to silence those whore pointing it out in the public wouldnt you
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,correct me
india,not_removed,yeah but uidai person says there was no vulnerability if there was none then leaking or unauthorized access to aadhar database didnt happen so why file an fir
india,not_removed,how can a organization and that too a foreign powered one that indexes our data has laws in constitution should i shoot myself or the head of aadhar
india,not_removed,but only lawyers with sane understanding of technology can argue that and i dont think there are many in our indian courts you also need tech literacy of the judges last i recall the judges have so far advanced to the tech stage where they can distinguish between flip flops and sandals
india,not_removed,the uidai has said in its complaint that sections of aadhaar regulations and section section of chapter of aadhaar authentication regulations were violated by mr kochhar spreading rumour is covered under adhaar act the delhi police has written in the fir that the aadhar act system was not updated in their cctns system and hence they had to write it manually on the fir haha so efficient rajnath needs to wake up
india,not_removed,time to put this website in archiveorg before its taken down d
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,dogs cows hyenas
india,not_removed,lodges a vulnerability fir
india,not_removed,he is trying to nitpick the fact that you didnt use the capitalized abbreviation fir and rather used the fir word a useless exercise that misses the point of the article
india,not_removed,exactly if they are filing the fir under aadhar act chapter vii offences and penalty its an indirect acceptance that there is a vulnerability isnt it unfortunately we dont have something like groklaw in india so we may never know more about the details of the fir
india,not_removed,from what i can tell he possibly made his app reuse pid gotten from the biometric device i havent confirmed this but this is likely to be a violation of the aadhaar act this is not a vulnerability because the system has measures to detect and prevent such reuse of pid
india,not_removed,if it is not then the case will fall apart
india,not_removed,from what i can tell it is possible that he was reusing pid generated by the biometric device it is likely that this is an offence under aadhaar act i havent checked it
india,not_removed,there is no notification mechanism for that here then that has to be fixed exposing vulnerabilities to public is always a lawsuit
india,not_removed,his argument is complete crap though it takes an easy hack to change this information and anybody can become you and transact on your behalf
india,not_removed,thanks this is quite scary
india,not_removed,gau
india,not_removed,oh it will but they are counting on the writer falling apart first and withdrawing his contention the legal harassment
india,not_removed,no it is not his argument is nonsense
india,not_removed,woof
india,not_removed,did he find any vulnerability in the system at all if not then he is only damaging the anti aadhar narrative
india,not_removed,why this is more or less like storing a password and then reusing it without explicit permission correct even if it is done for ease of use still a problem when i got aadhar the guy doing the entry didnt press his thumb on the reader to validate his identity he used a piece of cardboard it didnt hit me at that point but later i realised that probably the person who was authorised to enter data is not the person who actually did the reader could not differentiate between a real finger and paper copy so storing a fingerprint allows for it to be reused im still scared
india,not_removed,specifically this part of his argument is ieee certified nonsense in the name of security it has an additional timestamp and location added to this number it takes an easy hack to change this information and anybody can become you and transact on your behalf the pid which contains the biometric data location and timestamp that you get from the biometric device is encrypted so unless you know the biometric devices private key or are able to break one of the worlds strongest cryptosystems you can not change this information
india,not_removed,the pid which contains the biometric data location and timestamp that you get from the biometric device is encrypted so unless you know the biometric devices private key or are able to break one of the worlds strongest cryptosystems you can not change this information agreed but if the biometric information can be compromised and can be exploited by anyone then at least the uidai should have measures about it the worst thing is that unlike a password or pin you cannot change your fingerprint or retina scan if it got into the wrong hands uidai should either remove the biometric for general authentication use it at only secure places like airports or make it clear that biometric info acts only as userid not the password

india,not_removed,i wouldnt know
india,not_removed,most feminists want equality not the sjw bullshit you see spewed on the internet get out of your hole man
india,not_removed,the pendulum is so far up the misogynstic end that it will swing the other equally badly we have started seeing acid attacks on men i feel that women who are wronged will behave brazenly theres no justice for them as it is
india,not_removed,sure we do
india,not_removed,what are your preferences
india,not_removed,if his penis is cut and scrotum is intact i think he can have babies through other means
india,not_removed,going by that logic this dude was also a homewrecker
india,not_removed,you are justifying castrating someone on the suspicion that he cheated just because other women have been historically suppressed by society wow you have issues
india,not_removed,an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
india,not_removed,the pendulum is so far up the misogynstic end that it will swing the other equally badly we have started seeing acid attacks on men i feel that women who are wronged will behave brazenly theres no justice for them as it is and this escalation helps no one not the women or the men i agree women in this country arent treated fairly and i understand the official avenues are shit too but violence helps no one what we have in this country a weird sort of divide where the women who feel empowered are too empowered and those that are weak are too weak so this leads to more animosity between the genders women need a revolution but castrating every man wont help just my two cents
india,not_removed,i could probably justify most rape cases going by this retarded logic
india,not_removed,enlighten us living in the dark

india,not_removed,go on quora you would find much more detailed reponse to this topic than anyone here will probably tell you
india,not_removed,after many years indians are finally discussing government policies jobs infrastructure govt schemes what the government should do what should it not do etc etc a welcome break from year misrule when scams ruled almost all discussions and there was a general wave of despair all around
india,not_removed,modis major initiatives according to me are as follows jan dhan yojana zero rupee balance accounts swacch bharat first guy to atleast fkin talk about it make in india certain indian websites made due the the make in india initiative look crisp and modern compared the the ui of old whether this is bringing fdi is still up for debate foreign policy regardless of whether it bears fruit brand modi has made noises plus he just showed the world his cohones judging by indias militarydiplomatic offensive against pak major con new epf rule that essentially forces indians to have a pf until the age of cannot withdraw it completely unless we live that long im sure there will be more points but these are the ones that were most visible to me as a working indian
india,not_removed,modi supporter here so far modi has led a nononsense governance probably the first in india he has been the most corruption free and he knows how to sell ideas be it make in india yoga indian development indian values swachh bharat abhiyaan jan dhan yojana etc he does not care about the media and looks like he is truly committed to the vikas development of india and indians sabka vikas sabke saath this is in sharp contrast with congress or our shameless former president prathibha patil his image in foreign countries has been exceptional i live in the us and you will not believe how many times cab drivers and strangers from the us arab countries blacks etc have taken his name and said that he is doing great things finally i see him tirelessly working and despite some components of the media trying to paint him negatively they cant help it that he is a hard worker think of all those meetings he has attended after just arriving from a trip abroad he sleeps on the flight saves time and still does what he can again this is in sharp contrast with congress or our shameless former president prathibha patil it feels we have a strong leader he was combative during elections but he knew better than to carry the same stuff during governance once he had won and that is good finally i think he has great dressing sense i really feel for the first time we have chosen right probably this was the first time the newly educated masses you and i etc who were kids when ig was assassinated have grown up and supported a candidate in an educated and aware way some of his interviews can bring shudders to the interviewer for asking the wrong question and that shows the mark of a true leader just to be clear i do not know anything much about modi but i sure am a fan of his ways of governance his strong leadership qualities and i can trust him to lead india to a new phase and make india great again

india,not_removed,another awesome achievement is the drive to get government workers to report on time and work productively all day i have some family members who regularly end up meeting with various ministries and the difference in energy and efficiency from upa times is drastic bureaucrats are literally running left and right and theres actual work happening in government offices its pretty crazy for instance ill keep it vague for privacy of everyone involved they needed to hold a meeting with one healthrelated ministry and when they showed up there were two of the upperlevel of the ministry present along with several others once they heard the content of the meeting within minutes the room was packed with people in charge of policy people from an entirely different ministry which would become involved in parallel and a whole bunch of very senior people qualified in medicine and related fields and they gave solid actionable backing for the project with authority coming directly from the pmo no bribes needed to be paid no secret collusion no underhanded shit everyone in the room had a clear objective of getting some muchneeded improvement in the field it wasnt a project that would make anyone rich nor was it one where funds would be flowing heavily it was simply altering some policies to include more useful methodstrainingtoolsskills the exact same proposal had been brought to the upa govt years back and it was a frustrating effort just to get heard and not a single person moved or even cared even though with a few changes it could have improved the lives of millions of indians

india,not_removed,why are so less girls interested in politics a normal woman would have too many things to handle to care about politics so unless men have lesser things to worry about how can your argument be true
india,not_removed,not all the women work take care of home i dont think you live in metro city cause if its working couple both share the load these days you guys need to step up your understanding of exaggerated metaphors its quite common in internet to make a point
india,not_removed,how did it go from lesser things to worry about to men are just lazy assholes doing nothing
india,not_removed,the not all arguement of yours goes for your point no as wellthe gender roles in our society are yet to progress and if this whole arguement was about knowing how to cook it wud have been in favor of menbecause thats how things arethe reason we have uneducated women more confirms thisthey are raised for totally different jobs and thats slowly changingi have seen cases where both husband and wife works but wife still has to look after the house because thats what expected from hercomparatively few cases where both actually share the loadmany people i meet have the same statsthats how things are right now

india,not_removed,the place where all food begins its tempting in retrospect to believe that the food story was shaped by a january ruling from the food safety and standards authority of india fssai the regulatory body which began cracking down on laissezfaire food imports a few years ago declared that nothing would be allowed into the country unless it still had of its shelflife intact—no matter that goods packaged in the european union and the us carry best by dates not dates of manufacture selfserving as that starting point may be—the notification came on the back of a series of similarly wellintentioned if clueless steps including a ruling that recognized only nonanimal rennet cheeses—its implications coupled with concurrent concerns about carbon footprints agricultural futures and costs have been transformational for the restaurant industry this year how consider the cheese animal rennet is at the heart of prized products like italys denominazione di origine controllata doccertified parmigiano reggiano its nonavailability encouraged the rise of the artisanal indian cheesemaker who uses vegetarian rennet and internet recipes to develop tweaked versions of brie and grana padano like brothers prateeksh and agnay mehra who set up the spotted cow fromagerie in and now produce of cheese every month we make bloomy cheeses two in the french style and one in the italian we call them bombrie camembay and rombay after robiola since the originals are geographical indication or doctagged and cant be reproduced elsewhere says prateeksh dishes from pritha sens vegetarian bengali popup unish pawd photo commeat as thrilled as the mehras were with the welcome their cheeses received their biggest validation came when craft a casual dining place in kurla mumbai put handcrafted artisanal preservativefree cheese from the spotted cow fromagerie on the menu this was something completely new and unexpected admits prateeksh call it jugaad making the best of a bad

the indian theme but pushing the creative envelope significantly manu chandra of toast tonic joy banerjee of kolkatas bohemian and thomas zacharias of the bombay canteen make the ordinary exceptional

ponkh green jowar a ceviche with locally sourced red snapper kokum a souring agent salt and black rice a haleem with tender wheat berries and a slider served with a pickle of the humble tendli ivy gourd organic black rice mushroom risotto from kala ghoda café this is our second winter and its quite astonishing to see people come back and ask if we are serving ponkh or pink guava or even unexciting veggies like parval or tendli again says zacharias beyond mumbai we have also sourced bamboo rice from tamil nadu and black rice from west bengal black rice is also a big hit at mumbais kala ghoda café where owner farhad bomanjee—selfconfessedly more ideator than chef—gives the very indian ingredient a foreign twist he uses it in a mushroom risotto and as a side to a thai red curry with grilled rawas i encountered black rice for the first time in a sample bag from the original indian table oit says bomanjee i tried it out and immediately put in a bigger order its important for me to promote indigenous grains so that farmers continue to grow them and for that i really appreciate the work that oit does because its not something i would do a large part of the credit for the indianfoodfirst zeitgeist then must go to the allnew provenance entrepreneur professionals in their and who introduce structure ethics and accountability to a notoriously ad hoc system consider oit

to be on a new experience and great valueaddition nothing else will work theres a takeaway there for the restaurant industry as well which witnessed as amlani says a growth in the affordable casual dining segment over the past year at the moment it may sync neatly with the muscular assertion of a national identity mashing up a robust respect for indigenous ingredients with a distinct disregard

india,not_removed,well fuck last years iima criteria screwed over humanities grads pretty bad you had to have above to even get a call in my batch du only kids out of had above let alone
india,not_removed,last time i gave fms they had a separate fms exam which didnt give weightage to academics not sure if theyve changed their criteria after they adopted the cat mdi is a good bet for you if placements are your only concern
india,not_removed,how much is the fees now it was some last time i checked
india,not_removed,they fuck the engineering ones the same way afaik my friend and this is a real story scored he had average class x marks good class xii marks and a above averagedecent score in engineering however he didnt receive any single call from any of the top iims the only one he got was from iim indore and the new ones and he ended up showing a middle finger to all of them
india,not_removed,its even lesser afaik no hostel though
india,not_removed,mail me your recent scorecards will have a look and suggest something
india,not_removed,i know looks great percentile but actually it convert to something like rank among lac students because all iims have different shortlisting each of them select for interview now the problem iims face to differentiate criteria between each other to stop collision some do it by playing with acads weightage some by by work ex and everyone do it by changing subjectwise criteria of catalso weightage given to cat to select somehow different cluster of people for gdpi so incase one of top just calls by percentile also it would have been difficult for your friend to get a call
india,not_removed,its already happened to me thats why i asked scored in cat had good xthxiith at least they were when i graduated but relatively poor college grad marks average by university standards shitty by everyone elses standards got just one call from iimlucknow i thought theyd eventually wisen up and have a more nuanced criteria right now private engineering college kids and kids from boards like tn board have a big advantage afaik colleges like vit give out marks on average to everyone while tn doles out marks in xiith boards
india,not_removed,yeah but plenty of pgs nearby i studied at the college across the road from fms kmc
india,not_removed,which is why this is the biggest loophole a person broke his balls sacrificed his days and nights to get a and the schools want to make it look like it is his mistake or that he is not good enough
india,not_removed,you should have converted the iiml call buddy as of now its difficult for me to answer because i gave up on cat long ago but afaik they still follow the same process because elimination based on cut offs is much easier and takes less time
india,not_removed,around in xth in xii around in engg
india,not_removed,i think it is coaching institute effect all the major iims have moved away from only cat score based calls long time back but coaching start telling everyone with bad acads that whatever you do you cant make it to major iims their business will drop so complete cat industry dont talk about it at all and every year lot of people with bad grades put efforts in something which will have no positive in their life lot of them fails and realise that bad cat score was the reason they didnt get selected but few successful one understand the truth that they never had the chance iims are also the culprit in this when you apply for iimb they tell you that even if you score with below marks in and grad school we will not call you for interviewlot of people will realise that cat race is not for them but iims want to show that lac people applied and they selected ile people out of them
india,not_removed,i was a bit too nervous and a bit too young in the interview i reckon i had barely reached man and it was a bit intimidating didnt help that the professors seemed to have a disdain for humanities
india,not_removed,well all i can say is that if you really think that you can get a high enough score in cat again then definitely go for it and forget about iims and stuff completely right now even if you get into one of the good iits iitb for example that should be good enough the guy i was talking about converted his summer internship into a ppo at one of the top ibs so yeah the opportunities would still be there
india,not_removed,well exactly you are counting someones score when they were against them now when they are in their makes no sense absolutely
india,not_removed,financially it makes little sense for me to do a mba from a college at this stage in my career a big name iim tag makes sense because of the connections investors it opens up and believe me investors in india care too much about iitiim tags
india,not_removed,well now i get your point but even if you discount iims there is still fms mdi even though i consider their students immature and not that smart some iits xlri jamshedpur which have a good standard and definitely a good quality of alumni also as an option you can keep isb as an example however it needs gmat relatively easier than cat much diverse and mature students and definitely a very good name
india,not_removed,there is another stupid reason as a guy with no pedigreed institutions to his name and someone who feels he has severely underperformed academically i feel like going to a top iim will erase some of my academic insecurity
india,not_removed,thats an ego issue then p i hate to say this but currently our education system is built in such a way that it rewards high scorers but i think you know this already

india,not_removed,i was in iit kanpur back in for pg there are considerable amount of people from drdo hal etc being sponsored by their company for higher studies doing research in their fields so the interaction at personnel level is always there only problem is iits are not the only things around and you need to spread the funds among a range of institutions where there are a ton students with bright minds just trudging around with no opportunities better yet some of these projects can be made as competitions so that all colleges can compete and the government can fund the top five or so i see students from my local colleges compete at nasa level competitions why cant they do some work on these kind of projects its about time we started looking beyond iits

india,not_removed,i seriously hope they dont do that that will make the poor bear the brunt of the taxation and will be a big fuck you to them
india,not_removed,seems like something out of rtheunkillnetwork
india,not_removed,wont and shouldnt happen its still the primary source of income for the government from a selfish view point i just wish the govt shifted the slabs a bit and did something like to to to to and above and also revised the rebates to include things like motor insurance premiums
india,not_removed,hope this happens sucks to be in the category
india,not_removed,will it income tax is paid by only of population approx right if there is a banking transaction tax that would collect the same or even slightly better revenue that is spread across the entire population it will be insignificant for each individual and it would bring a lot of businessmen and farmers into the tax net without them going through the bother of filing etc also have read that the cost of collecting income tax is close to or higher than the actual tax collected not sure if right or wrong however i dont think it will happen modi may attempt an income tax cut instead to keep middle classes happy postdemonitization though
india,not_removed,haha so funny
india,not_removed,wont and shouldnt happen its still the primary source of income for the government btt is projected to yield almost the same or slightly higher revenue for the government it might not happen as it would be a radical change none of the larger economies around the world have ever tried
india,not_removed,while i agree with you on shifting the slabs the rebates should go most rebatesexemptions should be removed so that there are not too many loopholes for people to escape from taxation
india,not_removed,dont think so it would happen most of salaried folks will never cross the line
india,not_removed,even i am inclined to believe that it might not happen it would have a huge impact on an economy as large ours
india,not_removed,banking transaction is almost the same as indirect taxes indirect tax on essential items means the poor end up paying a higher of their income as tax than the middle class and rich with a banking transaction tax the same poor will have to pay tax on other expenses and even their income i call bs on the claim that income tax collection process is costlier than tax collected if that was the case the govt wouldve abolished it in a minute and earned the entire middle class vote
india,not_removed,you might be right i am not really clued in on this
india,not_removed,nrti
india,not_removed,whoa that is so generous of you i can suggest making a drink called lassi as the easiest thing you can make its a milk based drink is very popular in that part of india as a gift maybe you can get a small golden temple replica that place is close to that heart of most folks from amritsar
india,not_removed,i guess i have been visiting too much rworldnews because i read that as beheaded fml anyway thats a wonderful gesture of yours op
india,not_removed,gifts should be more personal interest based rather than stereo type as you have already mentioned that you know them so find something according to their interest which they dont have people from india love their food and special punjabi people are well known for their food love you can search punjabi food recipes and try them paneer items are more famous lassi is also worth to try for the conversation i dont think there is any specific topic apart from sex to avoid
india,not_removed,where in the us are you located if near sacramento i might be able to help by bringing home cooked indian food im a punjabi sikh
india,not_removed,well punjabi food for sure cant say much more im from south india
india,not_removed,kudos to you sarson ka saag and makki ki roti is quintessential punjabi but a slow cooked black lentil dal with simple nan bread can be a more simple way out yoghurt and buttermilk may be the beverages some suggestions
india,not_removed,thats a good thought dude gift if they are not teetotaller you may gift them some good bottle of scotch topics to avoid may be you can avoid asking them about their hardships sometimes it becomes uncomfortable to narrate tough times of our life and the reasons for it food preferably indian if you know any punjabi dishes else anything that is spicy and has lots of butter in it honestly it all depends on the way you guys gel i would even love to share a pizza with coke and desserts in a good company
india,not_removed,gifts scotch for dad scarf for mum and bookssports equipmentsmall electronics for kids
india,not_removed,op pujabi delicacies are not easy to cook up in a short time to be honest i would suggest you to focus on lassi it is easier to learn and serve them whatever you are good at the gesture matters as far as gifts are concerned i would leave that to you give them something based on their taste
india,not_removed,additionally and in the spirit of diplomacy what topics of conversation should i avoid do not be a one upper
india,not_removed,thank you ill be sure to make lassi a few times before the event so its right when i make it for them
india,not_removed,return home package just rs
india,not_removed,washington thank you for your offer though
india,not_removed,teetotaller today i learned a new word also the father has shared with me his predilection for scotch over other beverages and therefore its something ill give him i was leaning toward a traditional hindi supper but the more i think about it im leaning toward handmade dishes of pasta salmon and the like – my silly digestive system isnt terribly kind to spicy foods and while it would be easier for me to digest things my own family brought me up on would it be be selfish to not attempt indian dishes thanks for your feedback i appreciate it greatly edit only the father drinks scotch – to that end what would you suggest as a gift for the mother daughter or son the mother is exceptionally kind who often listens to music pertaining to lakshmi the son is in school for information technology which i myself am in and im not cognizant of what the daughter enjoys nor have i met here or know her age
india,not_removed,buy thick yoghurt whisk it in a mixer along with some sugar and elaichi you may add water to bring it to the consistency you think is right elaichicardamom can be found in indian stores anywhere

india,not_removed,sorry bud
india,not_removed,there are many indians and pakistanis in that area look for rwashington or something theyll be able to help you for sure one thing i learned in north america is that indian pakistani communities are really warm and are willing to help most of the time if you want to cook some indian food id suggest you to go to wwwshowmethecurrycom where ive learned all my cooking paneer is very popular among punjabis which you can buy at any indian grocery store one would be closer to your place
india,not_removed,im leaning toward handmade dishes of pasta salmon make sure theyre not vegetarian
india,not_removed,would it be be selfish to not attempt indian dishes no at all it is always good to try out other cuisines go ahead and make what you are best at after all we all love the chefs choice
india,not_removed,first of all respect for your gesture felt so happy reading this post you for sure definitely try sweet lassi and serve it they will just love it links for it she is one of the most famous food youtuber in india though her videos are in hindi but she has laboriously put subtitle in such a way that you wont miss anything one more linkmore for food i think you serve whatever you feel good even pizza would serve the purpose i dont want you to get tensed over learning indian dishes instead of spending quality time with those
india,not_removed,dont add elaichi elaichi is not in punjabi lassi if you can add homemade white butter on top and just a few drops of rose syrup
india,not_removed,thanks
india,not_removed,oooh thanks for the recipe is there other than a blender that i can use as i dont own one would whisking result in the same outcome
india,not_removed,neither rose syrup for pakki lassi kacchi lassi is made with rose syrup though
india,not_removed,you can use churner wooden or steel one see these video to find something to use a churner

india,not_removed,didnt they deny yesterday that strikes even happened no they said pakistani soldiers were killed they denied any presence or death of terrorists
india,not_removed,in a cross firing not surgical strikes is what they claimed though
india,not_removed,what the stock market taught us in the second half of december lends itself well to introspection the activity levels in markets die down as participants close their books and embark on a fortnight of travel meeting family and friends and merrymaking yes there is a flurry of reports on what the coming year is going to look like and strategies to navigate it but this time can be better spent thinking about what the markets taught us in the year gone by to quote from thomas friedmans latest book the ancients believed that there was wisdom in patience and that wisdom comes from patience patience wasnt just absence of speed it was space for reflection and thought in that spirit of lookback here are things that we learnt sometimes the hard way from our teacher to be fair some of them are eternal truths but forgetful pupils that we are oftentimes we need to be reminded the nadir for pollsters the most conspicuous casualties of this year were pollsters who failed to predict the two big binary events—brexit and the outcome of the us presidential election as jason blakely observed in his piece in the atlantic the forecaster on the new york times home page showed chance of a hillary clinton win at the beginning of the election night only to swing to a donald trump win in a few hours there is a lot of soulsearching going on in the field of political science but as we had written earlier the core of the issue is that human behaviour does not lend itself well to pure sciencelike modelling attempts to quantify human behaviour with mathematical precision are at the heart of social sciences physics envy one can predict the trajectory of a projectile with reasonable accuracy but not the vagaries of human behaviour betting on events while pollsters not getting it right was obviously a problem for a trader looking to bet on event outcomes what compounded the problem was that market reaction to the surprises was totally surprising too in the week of us election results the dow jones index was up every single day—the first two days because it looked like a shooin for hillary clinton and the next three because the markets viewed a trump presidency positively as howard marks put it in his memo whatever was good for the market yesterday its polar opposite was good for it today thats why tempting as it may be its better not to trade binary events beware of the consensus trade at the peak of a consensus trade nobody has the breadth of imagination to envisage what can possibly go wrong with it everybody agrees on how strong the rationale is and there isnt a speck of risk on the horizon through the year everybody including us was gushing about how compelling it is to buy shares of nonbanking financial companies nbfcs thats when this curve ball called demonetisation hit us and what were made out to be structural benefits like the ability to have deep reach and effectively collect loan repayment instalments in cash suddenly became the nemesis for the sector to be sure the last innings in this game hasnt been played yet but this is no longer a consensus trade the lesson here is to be disciplined about valuations when things clearly get overextended towards the middle of the year valuations for nbfcs had gone into uncharted territory all the reasons for reversing the winning trade may not be evident then but bear in mind that as things get heated the odds are increasingly stacked against you templates of the past may not hold periodic bouts of volatility are part and parcel of investing but as far as india is concerned the playbook for volatility in the past has been large capital outflows significant currency weakness and investors piling into the exportdriven technology and healthcare sectors this may not be the right template this time around for one despite capital outflows the rupee has held up reasonably well against its peers and both the technology as well as healthcare sectors are facing challenges of their own conditioned responses to volatility may not work every time be prepared to change your opinion for most of their history oil marketing companies omcs were shunned as mere trading stocks due to lack of independence one punted on inventory and currency fluctuations or subsidysharing shenanigans and consequently made or lost a quick buck on them that template of analysis changed a couple of years ago when these companies were freed from the shackles of subsidysharing and the government to its credit dutifully allowed free pricing for their products the return on equity roe ratios that were languishing in single digits suddenly got into the twenties and from being punts the stocks morphed into core holdings in portfolios in these stocks have stood out as islands of absolute return in an otherwise listless market but even today we find a healthy degree of scepticism in this metamorphosis especially from investors of a slightly older vintage its natural that past experiences and prejudices will weigh on decision making but being flexible about your convictions when presented with new facts was john maynard keynes sage advice it still holds true staying close to the metrics one of the most abused terms in investing is possibly a long runway for growth india is a very promising market for almost everything if the measure of future potential hinges on a per capita metric given the sheer size of its population and relatively low levels of income yet the markets are littered with carcasses of companies that were operating in these hugely promising areas a long runway of growth cant be the sole investing rationale and one has to be prepared to roll up the sleeves and focus on company and sectorspecific metrics every year we scratch our heads about at least one company or sector that had everything going for it from an opportunity standpoint but just failed to deliver one such example this year is stocks in the alcoholic beverages sector favourable demographics changing attitudes to alcohol consumption rising urbanization etc made the topdown story very alluring yet the stocks simply failed to deliver as other idiosyncratic issues held sway there are themes that work even in challenging markets in times like these one feels a palpable sense of despondency even with hardcore stock pickers as the slightly older generation of cricket lovers will remember at for in an overseas test match it seems all is lost and then the crisis man vvs laxman appears at the crease we feel themes like beneficiaries of pollution reduction and control or the data consumption boom will admirably endure through this period of gloom the fact that even in a year with nearzero market returns city gasdistribution stocks have done remarkably well is testimony to that escape from the echo chamber the most telling reaction post brexit was from a londonbased friend who apart from lamenting the outcome went on to say that he didnt know of a single person who was likely to have voted leave and hence felt that the outcome was rigged this is what we called the echo chamber in one of our earlier essays we tend to be surrounded by people who are like us and share our world view social media accentuates this by tailoring our news and opinion feeds to match our preset views to avoid falling into this homogeneity trap one needs to seek out and dispassionately engage with people whose views differ from your own and thats true not just for current affairs but your favourite stocks as well forecasting after unprecedented events demonetisation has been the most talkedabout event in the last couple of months forecasting the effects of such unprecedented events is understandably challenging and predictably analysts have opted for the status quo thus earnings growth for the sensex that was forecast at predemonetisation is now forecast at while that for has been marginally cut from to if this indeed comes true all the brouhaha would have to be filed under much ado about nothing what the eventual impact of this move on earnings growth will be difficult to predict but one thing we are sure of is that it is not going to be the nonevent that current forecasts seem to indicate a sense of detachment we close with a slightly philosophical lesson people with a passion for the markets tend to get totally consumed by this animal all of us have frantically hit the refresh button on our little screens at but as we grow a bit older we realize that there is a lot more to life than the daily gyration of the indices psychologist amos tversky puts it nicely the secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed you waste years by not being able to waste hours so take a step back cultivate a sense of detachment tick off some items from the bucket list and be prepared to have a good laugh even if it is at your own expense find some time to enjoy a sunset and smell the flowers odds are it will make you a better investor best wishes for a

india,not_removed,gurgaon
india,not_removed,yeah girls go crazy
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,which area
india,not_removed,read about drinking and the first thing coming to mind is gurgaon
india,not_removed,mumbai
india,not_removed,hahaha was listening to this on the radio last night httpsyoutuberjiohcggko
india,not_removed,yea but this was at another level didnt see such a level of public drinking all around town during diwali
india,not_removed,mumbai
india,not_removed,so problem kya hai were they creating nusciance
india,not_removed,easy to extrapolate not necessarily true did you survey all neighbourhoods in the city last night or at least a representative sample in my part of the city everything was calm no excessive noise people were out chilling and the bar was full
india,not_removed,no no nuisance it seemed like it was a night when activities like blasting you car speakers drinking alcohol and dancing on the streets isnt really breaking the law it was more like our community was give a free hand from the cops last night to do what we want this went all around town
india,not_removed,haha representative sample lol feels like im at work yea you could be right but around where i live there were a lot of people out on the streets yea and the bars were full but the people we still standing outside said bars on the road and drinking it almost felt like everyone had a license to break the public drinking law last night
india,not_removed,yeah not to the extent youd think though and there were no such people where i stay on a separate note bars are fucking expensive nowadays
india,not_removed,representative sample lol haha lol you generalised it to the entire city lol so i asked you that lol but around where i live there were a lot of people out on the streets this is more like it it almost felt like everyone had a license to break the public drinking law last night like it happens during festivals everywhere besides said law is archaic if you ask me they should have designated open spaces for drinking in certain designated hours given how expensive bars are a large section of people become law breakers by default everyday also convenient targets for the coppers when they want to make a quick buck
india,not_removed,for sure bars have become expensive dont get me wrong im all in for public drinking fun but last night was so surreal noone was worried about getting caught by cops

india,not_removed,this is not going to pan out well the bigger the success this scheme is bigger the mess we will get into government is subsidising air travel if it picks up airlines are going to add huge capacities and will buy lots of planes eventually when subsidy burden would bloat government will start withdrawing subsidies leading to higher prices and crash in volumes that will lead to airlines defaulting and many dead kingfishers

india,not_removed,nitin gadkaris driver is richer than him it seems
india,not_removed,this is good previous govt had much more invested in stocks for eg sonia gandhi had lakhs in stocks pawar saab had more than a crore chidambaram had lakhs overall i think its very good that many politicians from both parties have relatively moderate assets of all kinds i think there must be many randians who have more assets than these bjp congress politicians
india,not_removed,this seems like pretty dumb article for economic times to publish policy makers can not be shareholders where they can affect share prices i think by law jaitley would not be able to hold anymany stocks his decisions literally move stock market even though people are not prosecuted for insider trading in india doesnt mean there is not even pretense to follow it
india,not_removed,now i seriously wish fir real estate bubble to burst
india,not_removed,no it was just an article to point out the irony of stock market cheering when modi got elected and he and his cabinet not having stock investment no fan of jaitley but even if he is the finmin his stockholding does not amount to insider trading or even conflict of interest unless his policy specifically benefits one company there is no law barring our ministers from holding stocks i havent heard of any other countries having such laws because owning stock is just an investment like owning land gold insurance policies
india,not_removed,he buys it in the name of his wife kids driver brother sister etc
india,not_removed,except jaitleys most of their holdings are pretty low for people working from decades
india,not_removed,that will impact the middle class especially those who are planning to mortgage their house to take education loan this wont have much impact on elected reps who have govt funded houses salaries and pensions hatred makes people blind and stupid
india,not_removed,he creates budget if he declares subsidies for say poultry and has any share or mf in that sector they are going to go up he can extend tax break for sez and almost surely shared of companies liek infytcs might go up i cant imagine anyway in which they are no laws prohibiting insider trading i used to work for a bank in credit risk division and i owuld have to get approval for every stock transaction as low level as i was i cannot imagine no laws on cabinet ministers like suresh prabhu can just see oh this big tender for year is going to lt let me buy some stock first seeing their quarterly revenue is going to go way up because of me
india,not_removed,agreed but since article only takes into account investment from ministers i thought it was pretty weird
india,not_removed,half the rindia is richer than pm
india,not_removed,i still dont believe suresh prabhus wealth edit not saying he is lying but lakh seems too low for a former mnc banker maybe he must have invested in real estate
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,dont bother the idea of coi here swings wildly based on what party people support for instance if jaitley was on retainership for say the ambani groupwhen the bjp was not in powercoi in this case as you can see its not coi
india,not_removed,that still requires strong proof that jaitleys action benefits only the company he has stocks in and damages other companies he can own shares for investment purposes
india,not_removed,you want the real estate prices to crash since most nda ministers have a majority of their assets in it fall in real estate prices impacts regular people more than politicians on one hand people can buy cheaper houses but on another hand those looking to mortgage their house as collateral for education loans personal loans will be negatively impacted fall might lead to real estate companies faltering on their debt increasing the npas which will have to be bailed out tax payers as much as a correction in real estate prices is needed it wont be all good news
india,not_removed,the thing about conflict of interest is that doesnt always have to be actual coi even a perceived coi is just as bad from a reputational perspective lets say tomorrow aj decreases the tax on something and is then found to have bought some stocks of a related industry a year ago now it may be a benign purchase during which that tax increase didnt factor into his decision to buy but the market and the public is not going to see it that way pretty much everything that aj does will help and hurt some sector or the other it would become impossible for him to take decisions if hes invested in the market and must constantly look at his personal stakes in the sectors affected by his official decisions
india,not_removed,if it crashes and you have a mortgage that makes it unprofitable for you to pay the rest do not pay it thats what americans did
india,not_removed,the only time conflict of interest applies is if any minister is to make a decision and its outcome will impact the companyorganization where the minister has a stake in also regarding your point that say ajs tax break benefitting one particular sector which still doesnt amount to conflict of interest or insider training if that tax break benefits the whole sector and if he buys stocks later that is not conflict that is smart investment after railway minister announces investment in rail line extension me or even a politician buying stock in rail companies is not conflict its hedging on future growth till a rule or policy only profits or punishes one company it could not be considered conflict also govt announcing a policy benefitting one sector is not wrong edit not sure what was so offensive to be downvoted
india,not_removed,its not about paying banks evaluate the value and then disburse loans many wont be able to get it

india,not_removed,httpsimgurcomgallerycorok saw someone post this to imgur last night
india,not_removed,one day of burning crackers on diwali is actually responsible for pollution all year around if we stop bursting crackers pollution will go away and cities air will become pure
india,not_removed,click bait headline delhi normally has pollution levels times above normalaka safe levels throughout the year during diwali it was times that same safe level diwali is not causing those first levels
india,not_removed,delhi chokes on air times more polluted as diwali smog clouds india story highlights thick smog in delhi parts of north india morning after diwali pollutants as high as to times the safe limit in delhi smoke from firecrackers affects visibility air quality rating severenew delhi there is thick smog hanging over delhi and parts of uttar pradesh on the morning after diwali with pollution at a dangerous severe at am on monday smoke from firecrackers has choked the air and also affected visibility data from the central pollution monitoring agency showed that concentrations of particulate matter or pm coarser pollutants was over micrograms per cubic metre compared to a safe level of at around am in delhis anand vihar pm a standard measure of air quality was as much as times the safe limit show full article these particles can cause respiratory diseases if one is subjected to prolonged exposure to unsafe levels seven areas in the national capital region featured among the most polluted places in the country while kanpur and lucknow in uttar pradesh also recorded severe pollution a thick cloud of smoke hung low over houses in delhi a thick cloud of smoke hung low over houses in delhi pollution in delhi peaks during diwali as a hazardous mix of noxious gases and pollutants hang very close to the surface the delhi high court had described the capital as gas chamber last year as people celebrated diwali by bursting firecrackers on sunday a nasa photo at about pm showed the top half of india hazy with smoke experts had warned that pollution during this years diwali was expected to be worse than the last two years because of a combination of adverse factors like slow wind speed and moisture in the air a major hindrance in the dispersion of suspended pollutants popular spots like india gate and rajpath in delhi were choked with smog popular spots like india gate and rajpath in delhi were choked with smog the pollution monitoring agency has advised people to avoid all outdoor physical activity when air quality is rated severe like this morning people with heart or lung diseases older adults and children are advised to remain indoors and keep activity levels low a report released by unicef on monday said almost one in seven children worldwide live in areas with high levels of outdoor air pollution mostly in south asia and their growing bodies are most vulnerable to damage around lakh children under age die every year more than malaria and hivaids combined from diseases caused by or exacerbated by outdoor and indoor air pollution unicef saidcomments div classcommentslistdetail idcommentslistdetail nonedivpost your commentsrelatedpollution major factor in deaths of children every year unicefmore storiessorry i was being stupid he said in a farewell video after crashing then came his miraclelatest italian earthquake devastates medieval siteswe sleep because you stand guard pm narendra modi spends diwali with soldiers version function i post the articles text as a comment if the website is adblocker unfriendly rendered by prometheus
india,not_removed,i stayed home the entire day yesterday with headphones on and set my ac to recirculate the air quality was fucking horrible yesterday
india,not_removed,if bjp were in power in delhi there would be no air pollution s
india,not_removed,data from the central pollution monitoring agency showed that concentrations of particulate matter or pm coarser pollutants was over micrograms per cubic metre compared to a safe level of at around am in delhis anand vihar the air quality standard for which is designed to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety is micrograms per cubic meter averaged over hours epa is required to issue a public alert when levels reach on a hour average public warning when levels reach on a hour average and a declaration of public emergency at the level of the significant harm level at which serious and widespread health effects occur to the general population is of is extremely high
india,not_removed,has kejriwal blames modi already
india,not_removed,so what was the multiplication factor in this time the shor was definitely less
india,not_removed,both of these are not hindu rights right to freedom of expression is there for everyone and beating of crackers is a problem only because of the pollution and it doesnt apply to only hindus christians down south do it at christmas time and they should also stopreduce drastically because of the same reason
india,not_removed,i am curious what the situation in other metros and tier towns all the news talks about delhi
india,not_removed,its amazing how some people are still in denial i had to cover my face while sleeping coz that holy smoke had even creeped up in my room the visibility on road even at next day was absofuckinglutely low but yes its their birthright to burst crackers for no apparent reasons and cry that festivals are being attacked
india,not_removed,its not our fault that delhi walas cant control their pollution level
india,not_removed,hindus must burst as many crackers as possible display of their religion and self assertment is needed hindus must unite and become the largest vote bank in india its high time that in the name of secularism and environment hindus are not treated as second class citizens
india,not_removed,it already is
india,not_removed,today
india,not_removed,not as many individuals burn firecrackers there no its more like at one place firecrackers are burst and everyone gathers theree
india,not_removed,does everyone burst fire crackers in us on of july
india,not_removed,just apply that logic to everything else as well and its the perfect excuse to not change anything ever
india,not_removed,meat consumption causes air pollution where did you pull that out from
india,not_removed,in last years the number of crackers and amount of people celebrating have in fact reduced any sources for that
india,not_removed,numbers may have decreased but they are more deadly now
india,not_removed,yeah loser msm maligning our holy sacrosanct festivals for no reasons also they left out that the crackers actually kill all the mosquitoes and pests and are like soothing music for goats which would have otherwise been killed if it were evil eid
india,not_removed,its actually times for and for
india,not_removed,this is true you can check the stats yourself here httpaqicnorgcitydelhirkpuramm crackers are nothing compared to the major pollution sources
india,not_removed,unicef confirms delhi has worlds worst air
india,not_removed,sounds like a perfect diwali mine was similar except i ate too many sweets and fell asleep in the evening
india,not_removed,doing your bit for the cause by not bursting crackers but ac to recirculate wow
india,not_removed,its not that high non veg eating causes more damage to environment so we must ban non veg food first
india,not_removed,modi lives in the same city as far as i know maybe he should start doing something about this
india,not_removed,down south there is no pollution problem
india,not_removed,this sub has literally gone to shit now of the comments and discussion are so negative and trollish well done india after twitter fb quora now this
india,not_removed,please go back to facebook
india,not_removed,why did you not capitalize the vowels in secularizzzm
india,not_removed,display of their religion and self assertment is needed no clean air water and decent quality of life is what is needed you want hindus to be treated well cleanup your temples clean up the fucking ganges behave like civilized people instead of fucking sheep one of your holiest places is literally filled with shit dead bodies and trash clean that up first i am hindu too btw
india,not_removed,point is outrage on crackers is not proportional as per this news crackers increased pollution by and thats just going to be there only for a day pollution is fucked up regardless of crackers
india,not_removed,kisi satsang mei suna hoga
india,not_removed,meat eating doesnt but cows affect climate changenot air pollution tho the cows would exist regardless of beef consumption at least here in india
india,not_removed,httpindianexpresscomarticlecitiesmumbaisaleoffirecrackerslowerthanexpected
india,not_removed,so non veg food damages environment more than diwali why not ban non veg food first why so many concerned people about environment ask for ban on non veg food or you are just asking it because it is a hindu festival your convenient concern for environment
india,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikienvironmentalimpactofmeatproduction because this emission percentage includes contributions associated with livestock used for production of draft power eggs wool and dairy products the percentage attributable to meat production alone is significantly lower as indicated by the reports data so why dont you also ban diary products stop drinking milk since majority of emissions is due to cow flatulence kill all cows slaughtering animals is not the main cause its raising them
india,not_removed,he was in kashmir and himachal enjoying fresh air
india,not_removed,wow any opinion which doenst agrees with you is trollish i am asking for what i think is right
india,not_removed,lol i was thinking exactly the same thing i was reading this and was like wtf is this reddit or facebook
india,not_removed,lol
india,not_removed,ishtyle
india,not_removed,nope without an identity what i will do with all these i behave like an educated person and do not kill animals for eating
india,not_removed,the problem my foolish friend is that outrage on crackers is just as much as it should be but the outrage on other things isnt even a tenth of what it should be
india,not_removed,true but this doesnt mean you dont talk about it its not like we dont discuss the other causes of pollution and only stick to crackers
india,not_removed,the outrage on crackers will remove public display of hinduism from life and will decrease its importance this is the first step
india,not_removed,all these talk about the dip in sales this year this can be attributed to the whatsapp antichina feeling and also as more people are getting aware of the ill effects of both noise and air pollution these links however do not say that the reduction is over years
india,not_removed,at one time in dwapuryuga we used to conduct puja to appease indra and krishna stopped it when a tradition becomes regressive serves no social purpose it must be removed there is regardless nothing hindu about firecrackers where does it say in valmikis ramayan that firecrackers were burst
india,not_removed,i find no difference in the kind of reasoning given by hindu right wingers on the issue of crackers during diwali idol immersing during chaturthi etc and muslim law board opposing ucc all of you fags belong in the same basket id love to change something related to the other religion but when it comes to mine stay the fuck out
india,not_removed,okay now im convinced that youre a troll using the same argument everywhere and no other argument obvious troll is very obvious
india,not_removed,hah it is not just the emission again you do not understand the science it is the amount of water wasted and also the amount of people who go hungry because of non veg food eating also as compared to crackers the damage is very less
india,not_removed,nana im not indulging you
india,not_removed,hindus should become united and vote for their own cause it is now time that hindus should get their deserved rights
india,not_removed,without an identity what i will do with all these this is exactly what i was talking about with sheep reference i dont need someone to give me an identity the main identity i have indian
india,not_removed,thats exactly what this is focusing on this one day event at the cost of dealing with the real issues in delhi its been nonstop about firecrackers it needs to be nonstop about all the larger actual problems that make delhi such a shithole all over america on the of july independence day people set off far more firecrackers than indians do and they dont have any such problems with it its because the fireworks are just a drop in the bucket and not the actual issue focus on the actual problems so people will be able to enjoy a natural and fun thing like fireworks on diwali
india,not_removed,read your comment scrolled up and realized the downvotes are because rindia is secular
india,not_removed,did you read the links they are from every year
india,not_removed,india is one of the largest exporter of beef and also it is not just beef but all sorts of non veg which requires way more resources than veg food per calorie from water to land just understand animals use a lot of energy for their life processes so that much energy is wasted
india,not_removed,uoiyoi is right eating non veg food really is harmful for the environment heres a source for this in fact it has such a devastating effect on all aspects of our environment that the union of concerned scientists lists meateating as the secondbiggest environmental hazard facing the earth number one is fossilfuel vehicles httpwwwpetaorgaboutpetafaqhowdoeseatingmeatharmtheenvironment
india,not_removed,who are you to determine what is regressive imo non veg food is damaging so it must be banned also it is not necessary that ramayan must state that diwali is a festival of lights and one can celebrate in any way one likes
india,not_removed,lol calling others opinion as shit just because they are pro hindu
india,not_removed,go back to facebook with your us vs them crap
india,not_removed,no the downvotes are because the comment is either blatant trolling or blatant fearmongering and has no basis in reality especially since theres nothing in the hindu scriptures requiring bursting of firecrackers
india,not_removed,sorry i misread the dates a few of them were updated recently however still doesnt match the year figure all we know that there could be a increase in the first years and a little decrease each year thereafter
india,not_removed,then dont call it a hindu tradition non veg food doesnt cause spikes in pollution to times
india,not_removed,it is a legit demand hindus need to assert themselves they must unite and stand for their rights
india,not_removed,it is a legit demand hindus need to assert themselves they must unite and stand for their rights
india,not_removed,did i make the claim of years should we all commit sepukku since i did not provide sources fkr years but the years i know oh no we are getting better for years we should all die
india,not_removed,nope we can ban all non veg food and do away with major problem
india,not_removed,you do not understand how much damaging non veg food habit is read up about it and your understanding of hinduism is very naive and childish unlike other religions hinduism is polytheistic and can have multiple traditions hindu traditions can be completely different but yet hindu
india,not_removed,sceulars showing true colors
india,not_removed,and what rights would that be
india,not_removed,my original comment was contending the claim of years and you yourself posted sources would i be wrong to assume that your reply would be to my question also ad hominem
india,not_removed,nope we can ban you from earth and do away with major problem
india,not_removed,bullshit polytheism has nothing to do with firecrackers nowhere does it say you can burst firecrackers on diwali especially not when it causes the health hazards that it does
india,not_removed,which color is that
india,not_removed,you dont know dumb these diwali supporters are either they are effing dumb or involved in fire works trading
india,not_removed,right to freedom of religious expression and bursting of crackers
india,not_removed,intolerance
india,not_removed,it is not just about methane emissions
india,not_removed,it does it makes the religion pluralistic and acceptance of different traditions and traditions do not necessarily have to be written in books and can be acceptable also for your hazard argument i said non veg food is more damaging to environment so target that first or just out of convince you are trying to target freedom of hindus to celebrate their festival in any way they deem fit

india,not_removed,as long as it isnt about downplaying the west or pointless chest thumping ive heard stuff like this from my parents but ive always found them interesting because they never felt the need to compare or ridicule someone elses culture i am finding some of the younger gen doing more of the chest thumping than the old of course this is purely anecdotal
india,not_removed,what i love about this is the genetic scientist son sounds like an year old dressing as a geneticist for a fancy dress competition
india,not_removed,yes thats what i thought initially because people generally say decadescenturies ahead of someone at something but ive also heard people use the phrase miles ahead of someone at something so if miles can be valid so can light years but i am not sure

india,not_removed,i have a story about this i was working in the lab of my depts hodmind you it was an iit and hod here have shit tonnes of awards and conferences under their belt he was very professional in his class since he had an experience of living in some countries and travelling all over the world and class was industrial biology so the course structure contains brewing processes of various alcohols and other dishes which involve the use of raw bioorganisms so in class he taught he told us stories of places he had eaten this drank this wine and a whole lot absolutely golden information but when i started working in his lab i saw this side of him he sent mealong with other scholars of his lab several mails about the things you have just described and mind you he was a professor writing mails so he also attached many journal articles about these fun fact journal was a fake one
india,not_removed,should i is this some kind of norm am i missing out on a wonderful chitchat experience i need to reevaluate my priorities
india,not_removed,this is not a question of genetics or evolution doctors will spout unscientific bs before their treatments i have seen doctors even scheduling mahurats for operations the larger point is that we dont see people imbibe a scientific thought process in their daily life despite the roles they do this applies for scientists doctors or any other profession
india,not_removed,i doubt it would have been anything significant in terms of evolutionary theory the stuff that actually makes you think about the world medicine is a pretty self contained field of a number of applied sciences biology pharmacology etc i would guess the part that they do typically learn is medical genetics hereditary diseases etc which is also an applied science thing about applied sciences in general is that it creates this subsystem within which you are encouraged to think scientifically not necessarily broad and open ended questions that are encouraged in theoretical sciences btw this is also one of the reasons why we have so many chutiyas in engineering who cant think critically
india,not_removed,they have to study it to give the medical entrances
india,not_removed,yeah i am aware the we invant tone is fucking stupid lets assume that our predecessors were aware of history of earth and evolution and recorded it in a story like tribes in australia or america theres no proof of that so why thump our chest and make bs claims rant
india,not_removed,ah no this conversation happened because i came out to my parents saying i dont believe in religion or god in a very orthodox family so mom was like our religion is based on science and explained this and also god is not just any idol we worship they still give me shit for not believing and force me to do stuff but i dont also recently i saw old cosmos by carl sagan who also talks about hindusim and universe

india,not_removed,you mean your parents never told you throughout your childhood to study hard and get a good job so you can get a wife and then provide for your wife and children women on the other hand are told from their childhood only to focus on being good at housework so that they can get married and have children more often than not nobody encourages women to score well or get good jobs men are constantly pressurised by family and society to be providers and women are often pressurised to be caretakers media portrayal of men and women is likewise men are seen as failures if they cant provide for their families women are seen as arrogant if they cant care for their families
india,not_removed,same here this incident took place in the best place for pharmaceutical education in the country below the message were the hods clapping emojis
india,not_removed,of course youre missing more than just mere chitchat youre missing a whole story arc in your life be an arrogant rich western cultured individual boast about your superiority to locals be thoroughly trounced and humiliated by our ancient knowledge and zany local tactics get lectured on why you should be ashamed of embracing anything other than our culture and being a traitor to the nation get your hot girl stolen if youre a guy or get reformed into a indian cultured girl if youre a woman or any variation of the above
india,not_removed,are you talking about pmt or the other exam which doctors needs to clear to get a seat in masters course if pmt then people read about genetics and evolution in a very way and is no way near the actual studies this phenomenon of trying to explain this in a very simple manner is which creates many misconceptions about it and lead people to believe in many stupid things like the above whatsapp message
india,not_removed,you know i really liked stories like this my parents or when some other elders say it because they never downplayed the west from my personal experience some of the young gen and people in their to seem to do the west is crap schtick these days
india,not_removed,giddy up
india,not_removed,india imports a lot of stuff but india exports a lot also so when we would lose our advantage of cheap goods meaning our goods would cost more meaning their demand would decline meaning our income from exports would be less meaning the money that govt has would be less so when we would go to import stuff we might not be able to get the same quantity as before yes our purchasing power might have increased but the actual amount of money might decrease significantly that essentially we might not be able to buy the stuff that we needand this is not purely hypothetical it is a serious consequence of having a strong currency but not having the economy to sustain it china dilutes its currency for this very reason greece is partially fucked because it is a weak economy with a strong currency so the prices of many goods and services would go up plus since biggest usp of indian it companies is to provide an equal service at a fraction of the cost they would lose their clients since now they would move on to some other weaker economy where the companies are providing decent required services essentially we would have prices of commodities going up and people losing their job left right and centre in these times a pc would be a luxury and ration for next two months is a real need most would prefer the

india,not_removed,lets not kid ourselves plenty of women who think this way this has nothing to do with ones sex
india,not_removed,talibani hindus kekso original
india,not_removed,language mate cmon
india,not_removed,the issue here has nothing to do with their sex it has to do with verbal assault been on twitter long enough to say that these talibani thugs outnumber women who think this way by a factor
india,not_removed,chutiya is not language chutiyagiri is state of mind
india,not_removed,i doubt it women are just less open about such views india has a real feudal problem youre seeing people move up socially but mentally they remain backward culture of feudalism isnt bounded by sex
india,not_removed,its a colloquial word used when people use bad language to say oi watch your language at least for native english speakers
india,not_removed,i doubt it women are just less open about such views unless thoughtcrime becomes a thing its not even an issue we abuse lots of people in our minds what counts is how we behave in the open oure seeing people move up socially but mentally they remain backward you can make any mentally backward animal catch up to speed if you beat their ass black and blue lack of any kind of policing allows these animals to be kings of the digital jungle with their fake dps and avatars
india,not_removed,ok mom
india,not_removed,whether its online abuse in the open or whather someone thinks that way the line is quite fine between the two the people who dont openly say it are just imposing said views in an inconspicuous manner thats all gujjus never openly talk about their bigotry but every so often you see a mob burn people alive day to day youd think theyre normal people
india,not_removed,you can call these backward all you like rather imply it but you arent very modern either if you use the same backward language
india,not_removed,gujjus never openly talk about their bigotry but every so often you see a mob burn people alive day to day youd think theyre normal people do you mean to say that gujjus are genetically predisposed to burning people alive if you were born a gujju would you make that statement fact remains that people harbor thoughts of abusing murdering and sexually abusing people all the time that doesnt mean they are capable of carrying out their thoughts
india,not_removed,chill man the word chutiya is colloquially accepted euphemism for stupid it really doesnt have the same meaning as motherfucker
india,not_removed,no what that statement reads is gujarat has a disposition to bigotry more than other states vis a vie muslims but youll never hear that bigotry openly but it comes out in fits and starts thoughts are not the same as mentality were talking about the fact that people with a feudal mindset are limited to men or women men are just more open about it but for men its more obvious women it shows up in other ways
india,not_removed,actually its just fucker im not even sure its that but thats irrelevant still its untoward language and if indians want to be modern language is an important aspect of that
india,not_removed,you need to shake off the victorian policing in an open forum if i did abuse the mans parents i would accept your policing

india,not_removed,yes when i can if i didnt would that change anything is this about me no
india,not_removed,what is victorian is your policing people have the free right to talk the way they want unless they abuse
india,not_removed,what im doing is not policing you can choose to do what you like
india,not_removed,implying someone is uncivilized for using colloquial language widely accepted as something not abusive is that your choice too

india,not_removed,smart cards which require pins on the other hand require the citizens conscious cooperation during the identification process once you flush your smart cards down the toilet nobody can use them to identify you wouldnt a pin based smart card create problems for digitally illiterate not to mention literally illiterate population that is the main beneficiary of most government schemes and since they can be easily destroyed wouldnt it hurt the largely migrant labour classes for whom misplacinglosing government documents a big problem plus there is always the problem of uniqueness how do smart cards solve the problem of fake beneficiaries
india,not_removed,time to makeaadharniraadhar
india,not_removed,india does not have a law on privacy rs sharma that explains it all
india,not_removed,the title is ignoring the viewpoints that were published just under this one ie and the article tries to argue for all views and op has picked the viewpoint according to his bias
india,not_removed,this debate started years too late same chindu was cheerleading when aadhar was being rolled out
india,not_removed,you should have some real numbers rather than platitudes no dont worry they will come out with numbers without independent audit verification of course that you will have to trust
india,not_removed,what are the false positive and false negative rates again now that you have nearly a billion card holders and years of experience operating the database you should have some real numbers rather than platitudes no how much effort did you make trying to look for this i know for a fact that this information is easily available in numerous uidai reports you could have found them in less than it took you to write your comment
india,not_removed,and any attempt at independent audit will invite firs with deportation to pakistan as a punishment antinational branding is a bonus
india,not_removed,unesco certified from yale and wharton
india,not_removed,my point is if hed seen and understood how those numbers were obtained he wouldnt have pulled this uniqueness argument out of his arse the available numbers are from sample datasets not from the entire dataset which is fine if theyre large enough and properly analyzed the methodology of comparing only sampled pairs rather than all parwise comparisons in the sample dataset is designed to not find the true false positive rate
india,not_removed,so you just the official paid aadhar troll i see and again the same vague semi coherent argument
india,not_removed,the available numbers are from sample datasets not true fpir of was measured when the gallery size was crore and probe size was lakhs you would expect fpir to increase linearly with gallery size so suppose it is when the entire population has been covered already i dont think false positive rate is unmanageable i think that will amount to having to verify less than aadhaar accounts manually every day all over india
india,not_removed,and again the same vague semi coherent argument please dont use words you do not understand
india,not_removed,dude i think i know you holy shit
india,not_removed,no you are not taking this to the grave we know now
india,not_removed,reminds me of the days when i used to indulge in heavy pda with my gf now wife i was bloody shameless we were lucky we didnt get into any trouble
india,not_removed,hrs account claim you are nerd get all of our nerd problems and laugh at us chal bc
india,not_removed,that is such a low threshold for things to be taken to the grave
india,not_removed,i was and my sister was we used to sleep in the same room one night curiosity got the best of me and even though i was scared i lifted up her t shirt while she was sleeping and felt her small breasts she didnt wake up or showed any sign of movement so i continued doing it next night i did the same thing and again she didnt show any movement this continued for a few weeks and i graduated to sucking her breasts almost every night for about six months i would suck her breasts and finger her pussy i had a feeling that she knew i was doing this but every next morning she appeared normal and talked to me like nothing happened so i thought she didnt know one night while i was about to lift up her clothes she took my hand and placed it on her breasts and with her other hand she removed my shorts and started giving me a hardjob i was morbidly confused scared and happy at the same time i never had this feeling before while she was giving me a handjob i was fondling her breasts and fingering her like i usually did i stopped her from continuing the handjob when i about to cum since i wanted to last longer then i went down on her and she got off during this whole we didnt speak a word to each other and this was our first sort of mutually consented sex the next morning we again pretended like nothing happened and continued our sex sessions during the night or when we were home alone i stacked a bunch of condoms and after a few days of oral sex we went to vaginal penetration we both lost our virginity to each other and did some anal tike to time we mutually agreed to stop when she turned i know its hard believe all this but i couldnt really care if you believe it or not
india,not_removed,why is there always so many incest stories in these types of threads

india,not_removed,this is my throwaway account i am not proud of this i have seen my mom naked multiple times it started with first parental home where the bathroom door was wooden but rusty and old when i was in class i was cleaning the room on one fine day i leaned around the carpet around the bathroom door and saw a tiny hole i knew my mom was inside and taking a bath something rushed and i peeped holy shit i could see her bare back and ass that was the most insane masturbation i ever had i think i almost jizzed there itself there after multiple times i saw her through the hole i couldnt see her full body but mostly it was the ass there was once when she leaned towards the door to pickup the towel and i saw her boobs as well fast forward to class i had masturbated to my moms image so many times we shifted to a different place wherein my mom me and sister were only there my dad was in a different city i was really horny back then so i drilled down another hole in the bathroom and enjoyed the sight of her i drilled it relatively large so that i can get the maximum view those were the best masturbations i have ever had one time my mom was sleeping with her nighties on but without any panties it was summers and we didnt have ac at our place i woke up to get water and then realized what i saw my moms nighties had lifted and i almost jizzed seeing her up close i went nearby she was totally asleep i took my head inside nighties and almost away from my moms vagina somehow she woke up and understood what happened that was the first and last time she also stopped wearing nighties after that there is also another cousin sister of mine who i have always had hots for since my childhood she came once to our place for few days i could only peek one and got a glimpse of hard nipples that was one magical sight sigh now that i look back i am the worst scum of this planet im sure you will all judge me that is okay i judge myself as well but i dont remember these things now at all it has been so many years since this incident

india,not_removed,delhi to new york in hours possible by justin bachman ask a harried air traveler about the basics of modern flight and youll probably elicit surprise when they discover commercial airplanes fly only as fast as they did in the given the range of aerospace advances in the past halfcentury plus the technological leaps in almost every other area of human endeavor it seems reasonable to ask why cant we fly faster thats the question driving a startup called boom technology which says its time to bring supersonic jet travel into the mainstream—in a modern way the company is pursuing speed with an audacious idea a aircraft that cruises at mach miles per hour faster than the defunct concorde and certainly faster than the standard mph with fares no more expensive than a current businessclass round trip which ranges between and yet long before travelers can marvel at a quick hop across the atlantic boom will need to sell the airlines not just on a technically disruptive aircraft but also on one that can accomplish such feats of velocity costeffectively it must earn a solid profit—no middling returns allowed—and this of course has been a key reason the concorde was an aberration rather than the harbinger of universal supersonic travel boom is likely to encounter deep skepticism in a conservative industry that still relies heavily on a fundamental airplane design devised years ago the major global airlines boom will court operate with two cardinal maxims its really hard to make money with small airplanes and its really really hard to make money with supersonic airplanes which are renowned for their fuel inefficiency i have no problem seeing the demand for this airplane says marty st george a jetblue airways corp executive and industry veteran the issue is can you do it and make the numbers work radical update of the concorde boom will face a numerical gauntlet as it seeks to sell airlines on the advantages of a small supersonic craft with airlines posing tough questions about weight range fuel burn maintenance dispatch reliability and dozens of other issues the company also plans for its aircraft to fly on three engines a departure from the industry trend of using two engines as the most efficient configuration in response to skeptics boom touts its design as a radical update of the troubled concorde which was operated by only two airlines over years braniff international and singapore airlines had partnerships under which they also sold tickets on the air france and british airways concorde flights airlines no longer abide such loud kerosenegulping equipment which means new engine designs must be fuelefficient and coupled with meager emissions and low noise boom has diagnosed concordes operating flaws as twofold first the plane had ferociously high operating costs driven primarily by its voracious appetite for jet fuel grossly uneconomic in the words of a new york times article summarizing critiques of the aircraft second the concordes load factors were generally lean because of the steep fares air france and british airways were forced to charge typically around to in current dollars boom says it plans to address all of these shortcomings the startups signature city pairing is new york to london which would take a little more than three hours to fly and give a corporate traveler the opportunity to make a day trip across the pond and back leave new york at am make afternoon and dinner meetings in london and be home to tuck your kids into bed the suburban denverbased company says on its website a flight from san francisco to tokyo could be completed in five and a half hours boom says its about making the economics work and then delivering the aircraft we say we can deliver says booms cofounder and chief executive officer blake scholl a pilot and former app developer because of the planes sonic well boom the company is focused on overwater routes and doesnt plan to market its aircraft for quick zips across america or places like the middle east to western europe scholl says booms boom will be quieter than the concorde but doesnt plan any type of regulatory push around the issue in the companys early days boom has already struck a deal with the spaceship co the manufacturing division of richard bransons virgin galactic to use that companys engineering design and flighttest support services the spaceship co also has options for booms first aircraft as part of the arrangement richard has long expressed interest in developing high speed flight and building high speed flight rd through virgin galactic and our manufacturing organization virgin group spokeswoman christine choi said in an email it is still early days and just the start of what youll hear about our shared ambitions and efforts another unidentified european airline has taken options for aircraft scholl says and boom is talking to carriers about options for an additional aircraft an analysis by boyd group international an aviation consulting firm suggested that boom could sell supersonic passenger jets over years for a premium service on routes frequented by corporate traffic booms aircraft would target such global business centers as hong kong london new york singapore sydney and tokyo where corporate travelers would likely pay for the time savings a supersonic jet could afford boom says the plane would work on more than routes the company wont disclose a delivery date publicly but says it expects its first airplane to be ready in the early one potential tool to attract buyers will be the prospect of penalty payments which are widely used by manufacturers to compensate customers if engines or aircraft fall short of guarantees if were guaranteed the numbers someone will try it says jetblues st george with the operational costs they are expecting for this airplane current businessclass fares could make this airplane profitable says consultant michael boyd in a telephone interview it passed the smell test on this end this wasnt like a group of star trek geeks proving the economics the company will be forced to demonstrate that whatever positive performance data its models yield in computer simulations the planes will hold up in the real and very brutal world of airline economics that will require extensive flight testing so that boom can move beyond the paper airplane stage according to st george you can do a lot of modeling with software these days before the thing flies but until you actually see it you never really know he says boom plans to fly a onethirdsize demonstrator version of its airplane called the late next year working with general electric co it is aiming to initially fly ges engines a model that dates to the on the flights will begin at subsonic speeds and then get progressively faster boom has hired honeywell international inc for avionics and environmental control systems the biggest technical challenge however will probably be the engine as noted in a recent analysis by bjorn fehrm an aerospace consultant and a former fighter pilot in the swedish air force fehrm estimated that the boom design is likely to use about three times the amount of fuel per seatmile than current flights between london and new york would some buy some as flagship aircraft for highyield routes asks richard aboulafia an aerospace consultant at teal group latokyo new yorklondon sure i imagine they would but again it comes down to seatmile costs and until we see anything resembling engine specifications you cant even begin to guess at that for development work on the production models engines boom is talking with all the usual suspects scholl says the company plans to use a proven commercial engine core—the genx and rolls royce trent power plants on boeings are among multiple good options—and then modify that engines turbofan and composite blades he says that approach will require regulatory certification as a new engine which adds to the overall development cost in essence youre taking an engine that has a big fan and putting a mediumsize fan on it thats more appropriate for the boom design scholl says still all of booms engine work involves refinement of components that have been proven and flown and carry a known certification path for regulators he says theres nothing technically impossible here scholl declined to say how much research work an engine manufacturer would have to invest in this project but the market is almost engines based on the boyd analysis major engine makers would probably be drawn to a business that size version function i post the articles text as a comment if the website is adblocker unfriendly rendered by prometheus

india,not_removed,air india recently changed route for its delhi san francisco flight to take advantage of the tailwinds although the newer route is longer it takes to hours less moreover itd also help in cutting down on the fuel used prior to this week air indias flights between delhi and san francisco took a polar routing in both directions flying north from delhi over the north pole and south through canada from october onward flight is flying east from delhi through china and over the north pacific ocean to take advantage of the jet stream the highaltitude fast moving air used by other flights crossing the pacific while the distance flown will increase by over kilometers depending on the speed of the wind the flight will be between one and three hours shorter than the old polar route taking advantage of the tailwind offered by the jet stream on this route will also help the airline cut the amount of fuel it uses during the flight air india made the change after receiving approval from indias director general of civil aviation to operate on the nopac and pacots tracks that cross the pacific ocean source

india,not_removed,and someone wakes you up afterwards then
india,not_removed,i teleport and back so fast no one even notices im gone including me
india,not_removed,wasnt concorde stopped because people perceived it to be less safe
india,not_removed,yeah that would be quite a big drawback if its technologically impossible to eliminate that much of a loud noise
india,not_removed,yes but it had a flight route only over the atlantic because the sonic boom would rattle windows of houses if the aircraft was flown at a low altitude at supersonic speeds over land
india,not_removed,why cant we see these issues as what it means to indian it and not i am a geek who is stuck in india and hate infytcs this ill will for desi it companies is really frustrating happens every time such topics come up if my knowledge serves me right this whole india as it destination started with these guys did what was needed put india on it map of the world and journey continued from there likes of ms surfaced next and then came startups and now we have hipstartups where lot of people lurking here belong and leave no opportunity to hate these orgs overall they contributed to our economy is much more than any other industry ever did that contribution is in much larger ecosystem beyond it and no i am not working in any of these i am just old enough dude who has seen evolution of indian it
india,not_removed,there is nothing we can do about better concentrate on expanding indian it market we have a huge population and we should learn to make our living in india
india,not_removed,i have an immigration source who told me that the focus will be on work authorization cancellation and misuse in the coming days trump administration was going to propose changes to visas but tremendous lobbying by hindu american donors especially chicago billionaire shalli kumar and tech companies with strong ties to republicans has helped to delay any proposed changes for now
india,not_removed,so shalabh kumar makes indian americans vote for trump raises millions in donations for trumps campaign so trump can come and tell the indian techies to go fck themselves good job
india,not_removed,the fun will begin in india when a infywipro hater stack guru who used to boast about his techie skill gets a job only to see pissed off iitians as his bosses who could not get a that would be a true leveler for some of the arrogant people here
india,not_removed,this is really nice move as everybody knows how the visa abuse happens but nobody spoke till now he is really doing good for his country
india,not_removed,i think this is good thing in couple of ways hires will only be super smart candidates a lot of us based companies moving our their entire tech centers to low cost destinations thus driving out the jobs from us this is already happening you might see a lot of captives have already started hiring in india the kind of work which is heavily tilted into supporting legacy it that kind of work will either be done by captives in india or one of the major it companies in india
india,not_removed,is this the beginning of end of indias softwareitites sector will this drive this college engineering choices yes it happened in
india,not_removed,is this applicable to folks who already have what about people who are in us on right now

india,not_removed,trumps next immigration move could hit infy wipro tcs highlights trumps next executive order could overhaul us workvisa programs this will make it difficult for companies in us to hire foreign employees top indian companies along with apple google microsoft to be affected president donald trumps clash with silicon valley over immigration is about to become even more contentious after the new president banned refugees and travelers from seven predominantly muslim countries google facebook salesforce microsoft and others railed against the move saying it violated the countrys principles and risked disrupting its engine of innovation trumps next steps could strike even closer to home his administration has drafted an executive order aimed at overhauling the workvisa programs technology companies depend on to hire tens of thousands of employees each year if implemented the reforms could shift the way american companies like microsoft corp amazoncom inc and apple inc recruit talent and force wholesale changes at indian companies such as infosys ltd and wipro ltd businesses would have to try to hire american first and if they recruit foreign workers priority would be given to the most highly paid our countrys immigration policies should be designed and implemented to serve first and foremost the us national interest the draft proposal reads according to a copy reviewed by bloomberg visa programs for foreign workers should be administered in a manner that protects the civil rights of american workers and current lawful residents and that prioritizes the protection of american workers our forgotten working people and the jobs they hold the foreign work visas were originally established to help us companies recruit from abroad when they couldnt find qualified local workers in many cases the companies are hiring for highly technical positions in the fields of science technology engineering and math or stem but in recent years there have been allegations the programs have been abused to bring in cheaper workers from overseas to fill jobs that otherwise may go to americans the top recipients of the visas are outsourcers primarily from india who run the technology departments of large corporations with largely imported staff immigrant stem workers have contributed an outsize share to founding new companies getting patents and helping build up american companies which in turn because of their success have created tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of jobs said gary burtless a senior fellow at the brookings institution who does research in labor markets discouraging such people to apply for visas to enter the united states to work i cant imagine how that can be considered to be in the american national interest the trump administration did not respond to a request for comment on the draft the proposal is consistent with the presidents public comments on pushing companies to add more jobs to the us from auto manufacturing to technology its not clear how much force the executive order would have if it is signed by the president congress is also working on visa reforms and the parties will have to cooperate to pass new laws zoe lofgren a democratic congresswoman from california introduced a bill last week to tighten requirements for the work visa program my legislation refocuses the program to its original intent to seek out and find the best and brightest from around the world and to supplement the us workforce with talented highlypaid and highlyskilled workers lofgren said in a statement indias technology companies led by tata consultancy services ltd infosys and wipro have argued they are helping corporations become more competitive by handling their technology operations with specialized staff they also contend the visa programs allow them to keep jobs in the us and that if they have to pay more for staff they will handle more of the work remotely from less expensive markets like india inspections and investigations in the past have shown no cases of wrongdoing by indian it services companies which have always been fully compliant with the law said r chandrashekhar president of nasscom the trade group for indias information technology sector the industry is open to any kind of checks in the system but they should not cause any hindrance to the smooth operation of companies wipro and tcs declined to comment for this story a spokeswoman for infosys said the company is monitoring the us visa proposals but it is too early to assess their impact given the uncertainty of what will be approved we continue to hire and invest locally the company said in an email however given the skill shortages in the us and the availability of technically skilled workforce in various global markets we also rely upon visa programs to supplement these skills for the long term we are also exploring new operating models to ensure business continuity as we navigate this dynamic environment this includes reducing our visa dependency and efforts towards making infosys a preferred employer in the us the draft of trumps executive order covers an alphabet soup of visa programs including and the first is a popular program with technology companies and is aimed at allowing them to bring in highskill workers when they cant find local hires with the appropriate skills the legislation caps the number of people who can enter the us annually at including those with undergrad and masters degrees in recent years though outsourcing companies have received the most visas while other tech companies have struggled to get all they want in the most recent year for which data is available the top five recipients were all outsourcing companies led by tata consultancy ron hira an associate professor at howard university who has done extensive research on the subject points out workers at outsourcers are typically not treated as well as others the median wage at outsourcing firms for workers was less than while apple google and microsoft paid their employees in the program more than according to data he collected that suggests the american companies are going after true highly skilled employees while the outsourcers are recruiting less expensive talent he said the proposed trump order is also aimed at bringing more transparency to the program it calls for publishing reports with basic statistics on who uses the immigration programs within one month of the end of the governments fiscal year the obama administration had scaled back the information available on the programs and required freedom of information act requests for some data whatever specific changes are implemented they are likely to add to the expenses for indias technology companies that may accelerate a shift to new kinds of services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence said raja lahiri partner at the mumbaibased partner at consultancy grant thornton india the visa challenges are not going to go away easily he said they will continue to be a challenge for indian it companies except for the headline this story has not been edited by ndtv

india,not_removed,i would encourage all us residents over here to join the group httpsimmigrationvoiceorg they are working effectively to find solutions to the highskilled green card backlogs that is fundamentally the reason why indians and chinese are getting exploited in the states by the indian and american outsourcing companies i might add they are the main reason for being introduced in the house and are looking for people to do advocacy at the local level
india,not_removed,great recession coming to india china in
india,not_removed,tata consultancy services ltd infosys and wipro have argued they are helping corporations become more competitive by handling their technology operations with specialized staff yawnthis argument is a stale as a month old breadcome with something new and originalno one is buying this bullshit anymore americans know how competitive and specialized they areand yesnot every techies are little sundar pichai over therelol
india,not_removed,its time to take back the economy buy indian flush americanchinese products down the drain we have billion people we can self sustain a regional economy we can export to the african other south asian markets who are looking for cheep goods thrgovernment needs to heavily subsidize for industrialization
india,not_removed,i think the anger stems from the fact that these companies dont add much value in the us most of the visa workers arent topnotch but are mainly hired to do grunt work at low wages the companies who get these contracts arent mostly the highend sv firms its companies like disney who have large legacy it databases and uses visas to cut costs disney is rolling in cash and it isnt a massively innovative company why are visas going to be used in their business that burns bridges to techies in india who truly want to go there and do innovative work that is part of the reason why people get pissed whether you agree or disagree is another matter but i think its a valid pov
india,not_removed,randia is not a good sample size for every hater here there are people in real india who would love it job and it will take their life to a level that they had never dreamed of
india,not_removed,this happens because many people in here appreciate only technology and not businesses cutting edge technology is a great thing but so is a fantastic business which can run on very high scales with sustained profits the positives of fantastic businesses is highly underrated in this sub
india,not_removed,this ill will for desi it companies is really frustrating happens every time such topics come up its not unfounded the techies are too busy participating in a rat race to see the harm they are doing right now its americans training their replacements a few decades from now it will be the same hires training their african replacements wage depression is a very real thing that the silicon valley benefits from
india,not_removed,thats because most of these guys are kinda slaves while starting and putting us on the map and giving hopes to people is good they stopped thinking on their feet and everything transcended into drudge work ive been into that system and left it for exactly the same reason add to that these managers whose sole motive is to micromanage you instead of leading the teamgroupproject doing productive tech work is well and good but being a tester and calling yourself a tech guysoftware engineer tsk tsk
india,not_removed,if my knowledge serves me right this whole india as it destination started with can you expand on this would love to learn more
india,not_removed,what did you expect reservations lol
india,not_removed,who is shalabh kumar
india,not_removed,the thing is companies will become apprehensive to hire people especially since now they can hire two people for the cost of employee the interesting thing about this is that the citizens legal immigrants will become the grunt work workers that the current b workers are
india,not_removed,should encompass them as well considering how refugees who were already on the plane were stopped immediately when they landed and not allowed to pass through
india,not_removed,massive hyperbole the level of hysteria in this sub reaches new heights by the day

india,not_removed,ok grunt work if indians dont pocket them who will local american there is some amount of angst that people living in india seem to have as not making it to the us what about it folks in india are there not people doing the grunt work someone says cobol programming right now it is a rare breed heck getting cc people has become as difficult innovative work is soon coming to india will be happy to recruit couple of ms candidates in india for usd think about it you can save all the money and pay yku student loan from here
india,not_removed,if we in india understand business we would have become atleast south korea s by now
india,not_removed,a few decades from now it will be the same hires training their african replacements i dont think so in few decades ai and automation would be pretty much everywhere
india,not_removed,thats because most of these guys are kinda slaves who is not how is different than employeeemployer relationships elsewhere trust me infy of is much better than infy of in the scale of slavery its continuous improvement they stopped thinking on their feet and everything transcended into drudge work ive been into that system and left it for exactly the same reason well there exists a market and we have people you didnt fit in that system doesnt change the fact add to that these managers whose sole motive is to micromanage you instead of leading the teamgroupproject thats a problem almost omnipresent and is across industries only difference is that by virtue of being in it tcs is more visible on internet than say telco in tata group doing productive tech work is well and good but being a tester and calling yourself a tech guysoftware engineer tsk tsk i know a dozen guys in us east cost and in uk in it wings of financial companies who are some xyz vp all they are doing is either coding in mainframes or managing a team of five programmers point is its not important
india,not_removed,companies used yy format instead of yyyy for year so at the turn of the century a lot of companies scrambled to change their backend so that the systems dont collapse when changes to in
india,not_removed,honestly i dont have any one good source but you may start with
india,not_removed,great logic so when trump said indians will have friend in white house he meant that he would destroy the remittances flush the job market in india with job seekers which will drive down salaries in india
india,not_removed,the same reason latinos and muslims voted for trump
india,not_removed,somewhat but more important are indias software exports trump is a white bigot who cannot stomach nonwhite prosperity
india,not_removed,the most advanced ai right now has trouble solving captcha self replicating ai capable of creating programs in a few decades is going to be as real as hoverboards in
india,not_removed,who is not how is different than employeeemployer relationships elsewhere trust me infy of is much better than infy of in the scale of slavery its continuous improvement try employment laws in europeus you will know who is better and who is not fair pay better worklife balance et al unlike our indian companies where the entry salary for freshers hasnt increased even in years the manager literally dies when you ask for a weeks holiday or when you receive babaji ka thullu for overtimeextra work well there exists a market and we have people you didnt fit in that system doesnt change the fact agreed however our country produces engineers every year hence the companies can easily exploit to their hearts content i know a dozen guys in us east cost and in uk in it wings of financial companies who are some xyz vp all they are doing is either coding in mainframes or managing a team of five programmers point is its not important okay now this is going on a tangent i am specifically talking about drudge work
india,not_removed,im familiar with the bug i wanted to read more about how india became the it destination
india,not_removed,indians will have friend in white house it is the american version of mitron
india,not_removed,indian americans who voted for trump will welcome this move no doubt after all indians are popular for their nimbyism i got mine fuck you attitude
india,not_removed,you forgot stopping brain drain from india to america
india,not_removed,which will drive down salaries in india lets hope so some of the salaries people are asking has become impossible i filter out around resumes because the expected salary borders on the ridiculous
india,not_removed,sorry thats a lot of fud
india,not_removed,trump is a white bigot who cannot stomach nonwhite prosperity you are being downvoted but this is a problem not trump but his top advisor steve bannon has voiced his concerns about too many indiansnonwhites in leadership positions in silicon valley this is classic racismxenophobia trump will pander to it as long as it gets him popular support
india,not_removed,years ago nobody knew about self driving cars but here we are
india,not_removed,ok brother summary of my rant is simple google is not in evolutionary pathway of infy may be accenture is if it can become google good but thats ambitious and a wrong expectation if you think a bit deeper service industry has its own kind of innovation and they are doing it as far as i know
india,not_removed,this isnt going to stop the brain drain people smart enough to contribute to their society will still leave india for us
india,not_removed,do resumes these days list asking salary i thought that was discussed if hr initiated contact
india,not_removed,trump s core supporters are the same sort of americans who feel a major problem with indians in their own dresses roaming about town and smelly curries and eating with hands basically xenophobes who fear and hate anything that is not similar to them
india,not_removed,self driving cars have been worked upon since they didnt just pop out of nowhere they are also not yet ready for general usage
india,not_removed,so this will end up in concentrated brain drain
india,not_removed,when the recruiters send me resumes they send it with current expected salaries
india,not_removed,haha you are cute
india,not_removed,why cities in us and europe have more carstrucks than delhi yet they have clean air contrary to popular belief vehicular pollution are not the biggest contributor to the pm pollution in delhi or any other indian city majority contributors to particulate matter is road dust industry vehicles
india,not_removed,i think instead of banning things govt should have a closed big space in the country where people who do not like can come and stay this place is locked from the outside world all the gas inside is filtered is noise proof and highspeed internet people are provided gas suits when they absolutely need to go to outside of this housing space the number of visits outside should be limited to per months friends family members or colleagues should be allowed to meet the residents only for limited time and limited no of times like say once per month for minutes
india,not_removed,they cant do that without providing public transport alternatives although if they did have alternatives there should be a ban on cars for a few hundred years
india,not_removed,also stop all construction activities
india,not_removed,delhis pollution is caused mostly by the paddy burning of neighboring states this time every year they can ban all the cars on the road and the situation will not improve till those governments can stop seeing their own parochial interests and start penalizing people for playing havoc with the health of billions for petty profit so i guess thats never going to happen
india,not_removed,no i think crackers should be banned first
india,not_removed,its not about the vehicles its the emission norm a vehicles in bs is equal to a vehicles in bs emission
india,not_removed,there is nothing like ncr in us or europe they have never dealt with problems at this level and on this scale you have to remember this is the population of australia stuffed into such a small space and growing ideally parts of the govt should be moved out of delhi where power resides growth happens distribute the power distribute the growth
india,not_removed,highspeed free internet
india,not_removed,then formulate a policy to make all new cars to match euro bs emission how hard can it be
india,not_removed,london has about the same population living in about the same area
india,not_removed,well you pay for internet in real world too so i wont ask that to be free p
india,not_removed,yeah but dl lagega na pehle im still waiting on driverless to get going
india,not_removed,its not that easy what will you do with existing cars then ask all to dump it and get a new one i have seen public transport and trucks creating more pollution than passenger vehicles the govt should start to fix its transport system before considering the above
india,not_removed,then formulate a policy to make all new cars to match euro bs emission india will skip bs v and go directly to bs vi
india,not_removed,london has the population of delhi
india,not_removed,eh tuh mere reply padhta nahi na noobie dil toot raha hai re mera please saar please to read
india,not_removed,blanket prohibition would last only until a few hundred deaths due to illicit liquor and that wouldnt take much time

india,not_removed,service industry will script economic revolution and not makeinindia by nandan nilekani bengaluru conventional wisdom for the future of india is that we must grow like china japan and south korea that we must build large companies creating thousands of jobs and exporting goods i believe that domestic consumption not exports will drive indias growth the economy will be servicesled and not manufacturingled small businesses will lead rather than large corporations serendipitously this condition has arisen at a time when the globalisation trend is reversing jeffrey immelt ceo of general electric recently noted globalisation is being attacked as never before protectionism is growing around the world brexit is the latest proof of the challenge indias exports standing at billion in june have slowed for the consecutive month in the meanwhile a key component of delivering services the mobile phone is becoming the universal electronic product in everybodys hands india is selling million smartphones per quarter and the anticipation is million smartphones in hand by internet penetration is growing with million internet users india is now the second largest internet market ahead of the us another building block in india is the aadhaar number the worlds largest digital infrastructure for establishing unique identity the system has a billion people and can already authenticate million transactions per day aadhaar is the only billionuser platform outside the us and the only government one designed in as an online identity platform for all indian residents aadhaar provides open application programming interfaces or apis which can be integrated easily into any electronic device these apis enable online authentication using a fingerprint or iris recently samsung introduced an aadhaarcompliant tablet with a camera that in a single click performs iris authentication with the introduction of prime minister narendra modis jan dhan yojana for financial inclusion more than million bank accounts are linked to aadhaar today and several billion dollars of benefits and entitlements have been transferred to peoples bank accounts electronically in real time the arrival of new age platform aggregators from amazon and flipkart for small merchants to uber and ola cabs for taxis will create a huge digital footprint that could be leveraged by individuals and businesses to secure credit such platform aggregators will also create jobs not as monolithic large organisations but as millions of small entrepreneurs connected to a platform these platforms enabling seamless transactions give the service economy a big boost india is the largest young country in an ageing world and will continue to have a young population for the next years whereas china has started ageing indians will either migrate or do outsourcing work care providers around the world will come from india there will be doubling of gdp growth in housing education health all services services are labour intensive and their incremental return on capital is much faster than manufacturing and then there will be services like tourism that create jobs thailand for example has million international visitors per year while india has only million many economists have suggested that india should copy china but it cannot when china started its development journey it had no established competition global overcapacity challenges india for example china has steel capacity of million tonnes and india has million tonnes recently the india government had to protect its steel industry by introducing minimum import pricing normal competition without tariffs will be difficult in many sectors indias manufacturing and agricultural sectors are fragmented due to excise and other taxes and also due to a lack of infrastructure cold chains storage processing and more yet india has a single market for banking telecom insurance and capital markets consider to launch an insurance policy or a mortgage in the us one must go to regulators in the eu one must go to all member countries china has a single market but no free movement of labour indias free market for labour combined with single market for services is the reason why services is the countrys biggest growth area the only place where india can achieve economy of scale is in services this is apparent in the dramatic growth of service tax the india stack a set of programming interfaces built on the trifecta of governmentcreated peoples bank account of jan dhan aadhaar and mobile phones in brief jam enables paperless presenceless and cashless transactions the reserve bank of india introduces unified payment interface on july allowing all payments to be made by mobile phone which backed by jam will lead to dramatic leaps in productivity dramatic consequences will follow creating thousands of startups and billions of dollars of capitalisation four shifts will happen first banking at scale because everything a bank can do individuals can do on a mobile phone second investment at scale people can buy a mutual fund on the phone with one click third credit at scale where entrepreneurs can get a loan with just a click by aggregating their own data and fourth skilling at scale as platforms happen india will have thousands millions of people gathering skills to operate in this new economy with great strides in reading and math literacy happening at scale world trade may be shrinking and barriers may be emerging among nations all making movement of labour difficult india with its vast unified market youthful labour force and growing digital platformbacked services alone is poised to build a new power economy this essay is adapted from a speech delivered at microsoft think next in

india,not_removed,i think its more about the equality of the sexes than trying to bring society forward in an educationaloccupational way if people want to do something and are restricted from it solely because of their gender thats what people are trying to fight and thus the difference between women being underrepresented in legislatures judges benches etc is a completely different issue from women being banned from certain temples
india,not_removed,because of symbolism these temples represent they are one of the last shelters of absolute gender based discrimination you wont hear people publicly arguing against womens participation in any other arena you mentioned at least not without fear of being labeled antiprogress but a lot of loud mouths are willing to speak out in press against telling temple brahmins to step into century remember exceptions weaken arguments especially if you are arguing for equality
india,not_removed,easy to ignore the issue if you are an aethiest you will not want to be there in the first place simply its not a place of your interest however if you look at it from persepective of whether its a public place and your right as an equal citizen to be in a place of your choice which is public place is more important than anyones religious believes in the indian context temples come under public domain however that being said there are many temples which have a code of devotees entering the temple jagannath temple at puri does not allow nonhindus the moral argument demands public places being available to people without discrimination on the basis of religion caste creed or sex morally speaking girls and even guys should be concerned about it
india,not_removed,well theres a difference between hinduism which isnt controlled by any governing body and the roman catholic church and other denominations that do have governing bodies in such instances government intervention cant do much for such denominations also an equivalent comparison wouldnt be the one you just made it would be between female christian clergy and female pujarispriests in hindu temples i am not aware of any instances of women being kept out of any church or synagogue
india,not_removed,heard of rosa parks the symbolic act of refusing to give up her seat for a white passenger was made the turning point for civil rights movement they too had other issues like poverty education and jobs for blacks symbols are very powerful tools edit added a word
india,not_removed,it does make a powerful impact though read up on how ambedkar used protests of dalits to enter temples to ignite dalit consciousness even though he himself was pretty agnostic while the life of an average dalit might not have improved much it did popularise the dalits struggle

india,not_removed,yes data never had roaming charges only calls
india,not_removed,no local municipalities should designate zones for fireworks and the city authorities should do a fireworks display instead and encourage people to attend that rather than all bursting fireworks at the same time
india,not_removed,why is something that is not ok according to you should be banned as you yourself stated that there were people enjoying the fireworks so why should govt ban things just because you dont happen to enjoy them i didnt enjoy reading toi should i ask govt for a ban because printing toi damages environment used ink is cancerogenic and i also happen to not like their way of reporting things
india,not_removed,only speak for your state we gujarratis love busting phatakhe on diwali
india,not_removed,mathematically speaking the number of patakas you fodofy on diwali is directly proportional to the amount of money you have divided by the amount of grey matter you have
india,not_removed,whatever way that works but the truth is even sc guidelines are ignored
india,not_removed,around lakh children under age die every year more than malaria and hivaids combined from diseases caused by or exacerbated by outdoor and indoor air pollution there is a big difference between i do not like nonveg so ban it and this harmful smoke is something that affects all those who are not responsible for it but it is because of enjoymentfreaks that many others have to suffer supported by blabbermouths who can not literally see how the citys sky has changed from clear to smoggy for a simple reason logic is not for everyone true fireworks are not the only cause but in one day they spike the pollution levels to alarming levels
india,not_removed,as you yourself stated that there were people enjoying the fireworks if my idea of enjoyment is to stand next to your house and burn a huge lump of coal generating co etc i hope youll support me used ink is cancerogenic and and i also happen to not like their way of reporting things apples and oreos unless you are forced to touch toi unlike people and animals who are forced to endure the noise and air pollution caused by fireworks the two are absolutely different equating the two is illogical and regarding the pollution caused by toi let me introduce you to the concept of trade offs something every adult should know most human economic activity causes pollution which is why nobody is trying to ban all pollution however theres pollution that is in the service of an economic activity such as transportation and industry which we live with but try to regulate with environmental regulation and pollution in the service of a juvenile fascination with loud noises and pretty colors made possible by forcing children to work with hazardous chemicals the first one is bad but unavoidable the second is plain irresponsible and frivolous
india,not_removed,do you have a better idea to avoid harmful effects of smoke specially since pollution levels have already crossed alarming levels
india,not_removed,i am not sure if this fits better in rcringe or riamverysmart
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,you do understand that this stat is not for a single day or after diwali week it is for a whole year of which i do not think diwali is the only major factor there is a big difference between i do not like nonveg so ban it and this no this is the same power game i do not like it and it also happens to be bad for the environment so might just as well ban it people who genuinely want solutions to problems and not kneejerk reactions do not call out for bans like this like upatharkagosht has suggested there are other ways of curbing this just like there are other ways of curbing pollution from vehicles without calling an all out ban on them
india,not_removed,huh huge number of people die of hunger so we must act on unsustainable food habits like non veg food i am sure the number of people affected by malnutrition is huge the palatal enjoyment costs too much for poor logic is definitely for everyone who cannot see huge amount of damage done by non veg food but shout on one day celebration
india,not_removed,find such people bring them here and i would happy to explain the differences bw this and tripletalaq or sati and why it is not the same and thus cant be handled in the same way
india,not_removed,if my idea of enjoyment is to stand next to your house and burn a huge lump of coal generating co etc i hope youll support me i might not appreciate it but i will not be calling out for a ban on it if enough people enjoy this activity there are better ways then just ban things to solve a problem equating the two is illogical that was the point of making that statement illogical demands are met with illogical comparisons and stupid extremes let me introduce you to the concept of trade offs so when talking of tradeoffs what i learned from my environmental economics class was that we make trade offs with the environment and generate wealth and use a part of that to restore the environment so why not extend this to fire crackers too govt is generating tax revenues from this they use a part of that to restore the environment and also to mitigate the effects of this activity on people prior to the activity why is there a need to call for a ban on this activity possible by forcing children to work with hazardous chemicals this is illegal and govt should be more vigilant in this regard
india,not_removed,yes look at upatharkagoshts suggestion it is good to have designated areas for bursting firecrackers most localities have a park or an open field children or firecracker enthusiasts can gather there and enjoy their firecrackers people who dont like will not need to suffer it in their lane or street banning things is not the only way of doing it as far as pollution goes i think better ways to tackle pollution all around the year should be explored not just of one day plant more trees encourage people to get their vehicles checked for emission levels etc encourage people to use taxiuberolapublic transport instead of buying a car for themselves encourage people in a locality to car pool
india,not_removed,cannot understand why people downvote legit points
india,not_removed,both
india,not_removed,oh shut up people who are affected by malnutrition arent rich enough to buy nonveg
india,not_removed,it is not about rich and poor it is about collective effort to make planet sustainable
india,not_removed,from my other reply on this thread that was the point of making that statement illogical demands are met with illogical comparisons and stupid extremes
india,not_removed,to make the planet sustainable you improve the efficiency of farms you use cow dung to produce electricity fertilizers etc you dont just cut off one side of the nutrition tree because it hurts your morality it is not about rich and poor it is about collective effort to make planet sustainable in this thread people were talking about banning fireworks for a year thats the title fireworks cause pollution by spm not ghg well they do emit ghg just not that much how is your nonveg tirade which i see youre doing on almost every thread talking about pollution even relevant to pollution caused by livestock farming
india,not_removed,wrong assumption about nutrition tree you can get nutrition from veg sources too sustainable lifestyle is veg not non veg
india,not_removed,im not making the assumptions you are you are the one who made the claim that you can get all nutrients from a complete vegan diet im sorry but hundreds of millions of years of evolution disagree with you and food scientists do too ill just give one example to negate your assertion however eliminating all animal products from the diet increases the risk of certain nutritional deficiencies micronutrients of special concern for the vegan include vitamins and d calcium and longchain n– fatty acids unless vegans regularly consume foods that are fortified with these nutrients appropriate supplements should be consumed in some cases iron and zinc status of vegans may also be of concern because of the limited bioavailability of these minerals from basically you need designer food calcium fortified tofu calc fort soy milk etc etc to meet your needs and those things dont come cheap the idea of a good food is to properly balance intake of both meat and veggies to get a proper diet
india,not_removed,i said vegetarian not vegan why lie also it is not at all necessary to eat meat to have balanced diet again you are lying and making assumption i say it loud and clear you do not need meat or chicken to survive or get enough nutrition stop lying and justifying your bad habits
india,not_removed,i said vegetarian not vegan wow so here is where the flip flop begins veganism is a subset of vegetarianism some vegetarians eat milk and eggs so your entire tirade against livestock farming is invalid if you consider the other classes of vegetarians you will still have ghg emissions water issues etc also it is not at all necessary to eat meat to have balanced diet again you are lying and making assumption i say it loud and clear you do not need meat or chicken to survive or get enough nutrition stop lying and justifying your bad habits i am not saying anything physicians and clinical nutritionists are you believe that eating veggies is the way to go fair enough stop forcing your views on everyone else
india,not_removed,nope my entire tirade is to make planet sustainable without compromising health nope having meat is not at all essential for good health
india,not_removed,nope my entire tirade is to make planet sustainable without compromising health nope having meat is not at all essential for good health you should stop eating non veg in order to sustain the planet
india,not_removed,no i wont bye
india,not_removed,unkill preferes homeopathy cant convince him
india,not_removed,these people dont know about my mama who had insert illness but homeopathy cured him
india,not_removed,we shouldnt be using homeopathy for those illnesses then
india,not_removed,you think people care about these studies
india,not_removed,and here i know a guy who is ready to spend around for hair loss treatment in homeocare
india,not_removed,isnt homeopathy the thing where the doctor puts a that chord in your chest and then prescribes medicines except the medicines are tiny sweet balls inside a plastic container where the pharmacist drops some medicine in i used to have that back when i was young they told me to pop pills i would swallow half the bottle at one go i think they worked because this one time my fever was gone over night
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,i can see a lot of people jest and joke about homeopathy and feel incredulous as to how people can be blinded into believing something that has been proven to be untrue by more or less everyone in the scientific community however it is very easy to mould a person to believe in something after they have gone through suffering and come out of it thinking a specific thing homeopathy in this case cured them of the pain and suffering my dad was an engineer and also a dabbler in homeopathy once when i was very young i had a severe throat infection and he came up with a concoction that sped up my recovery considerably my dad was a sensible reasonable generous kind and rational man i cant criticise him for what he believed in up until recently his books on homeopathy on the bookshelf always lured me to take up what he believed in and when i started reading about homeopathy and saw all the evidence stacked up against it i realised that it is much wiser to believe in something that is scientifically proven rather than blindly following my fathers hobby i would rather pass that belief on to my kids and not give in to blind faith or emotion especially when it comes to curing other people in retrospect i can see now that just by getting the attention of my father his care and love he used to be very occupied with work probably worked more in curing me the homeopathic medicine worked as a placebo anyway the point was that when people undergo suffering and come out of it thinking x cured them its very difficult to dislodge that faith in x only sound education and open and inquisitive minds can rid the society of its false beliefs one day
india,not_removed,as if people care they believe what they want to believe
india,not_removed,yeah fuck homeopathy wasnt that some bullshit german nonsense anyways
india,not_removed,ill just leave here
india,not_removed,study is flawed even placebos have higher rates of success its known something fishy
india,not_removed,serious ive tried all classes of medicine myself normal ayurvedic homeopathic village medicine and personally found that for most of the minute problems ayurvedic was byfar the best choice uncle is an ayurvedic surgeon yes ayurvedic surgeon he does practice normal too though for larger cases how is that no tests confirm their effectiveness like for example i have cold right now and itll be healed by tomorrow morning no side effects unlike normal medicines im just confused curious ¯ツ¯ edit spelling
india,not_removed,why does the government even support homeopathy
india,not_removed,same as about accpressure it is based on placebo effect nothing more
india,not_removed,i think the time to settle this pointless debate has come once for all a pil should be filed in the supreme courts the courts can then sanction a panel to come up with a scientific conclusion the government would have no choice but to agree with the outcome of such a panel for all the political trolls blaming mudi for being ignorant about this issue seriously this is a pan india phenomenon its not as if modi sanctioned homeopathy for the first time after being the pm its a dumb practice that goes on as does the ignorance of literally a billion indians lawyers of randia does a pil have a chance of sticking and making a difference here in this case
india,not_removed,fuck it i quite enjoy stupid shit people talk about homeopathy as the ilaaj gene pool is getting fixed slowly
india,not_removed,india still invests millions of dollars into ayushs homeopathy division we still have colleges teaching this shit and doctors practicing this however unlike other countries which have taken steps to make this known and started toning down no public funding dont call them doctors educate the public india will do nothing of the sort because homeopathy sells and it would be political suicide to even consider shutting down a branch of goi so many medical colleges so we will continue to put up with this shit on another note there have been enough studies on homeopathy already that have proven it to be no better than placebo we should stop funding such studies so that the money could go to better places
india,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbgxzsuxxrze hilarious video on homoeopathy
india,not_removed,homeopathy is the air guitar of medicine
india,not_removed,wall कमज़ोरी और शीघ्रपतन मिलें हकीम उस्मानी। स्वप्नदोष और गुप्त रोग विशेषज्ञ। wall
india,not_removed,placebo effect
india,not_removed,what is the point of even conducting these studies anymore any reasonable person who knows the basis of homeopathic medicine couldve predicted the result and we all know how the governments and health departments will just not care and continue fundingpromoting homeopathy
india,not_removed,these sort of problems are generational the older generation grew up believing in such things which the younger generation knows it utterly bogus and can only wait for their time to arrive so they can stop believing in them there are such beliefs all over the world and we can only hope that with a solid engineering background which most people in this country seem to have these beliefs will go away
india,not_removed,so youre saying it works on all illnesses except these s
india,not_removed,what about ayurveda
india,not_removed,bc in my area bhms doc treating people with allopathic
india,not_removed,also what about hundreds of homeopathy colleges
india,not_removed,please dont confuse homeopathy in western world with ayurvedic medicine from east homeopathy is a specific way of treating disease by significantly diluting a medicine that is suppose to cure the disease they just called it homeopathy in the west and now gets confused with homeopathy in east
india,not_removed,increase funding to ayush thats one thing that upa and nda agree upon at least
india,not_removed,ignore it
india,not_removed,homeopathy has zero intrinsic efficacy and scant evidence of any potential but has a variable degree of placeboinduced therapeutic effect however there are a number of largely psychosomatic conditions that modern scientific medicine cannot cure in these very very limited number of conditions homeopathy or ayurveda can be advised
india,not_removed,well it may be a placebo effect induced therapeutic effect but homoeopathy worked for all my throat problems at least so after reading this study there shouldnt be a placebo effect on me next time i take the medicine no so lets see then d
india,not_removed,it is interesting that the article came in uk newspaper and prince charles uses homeopathy on his cows to cut usage of antibiotics the most important thing in medicine is trust and if homeopathy is giving the trust to people i feel there is no harm coming from it
india,not_removed,read the article dont question the study blindly believe it play the role of a cyber expert with useless comments which in no way discuss the findings
india,not_removed,that modi video is gold jerry gold amongst the gems and i paraphrase just like you see auras around the heads of rishimunis in their photographs medical technology is advancing to take photograps of auras which are formed apparantly as a gestalt of body mind and soul atma that can predict illnesses you are likely to contract years down the line pm manmohan singh this was in is just waking up to child malnutrition and calling it a national shame gujarat recognised this problem long ago and we started a program in to tackle this problem weve spent rs so far and achieved phenomenal results future envisioned strategies include homeopathy to teething infants to boost their immune systems the phenomenal results not quite described in the speech include gujarat one of the richest states in india continuing to stagnate amongst bimaru states when it comes to child malnutrition and other human development indices this man will lead us to become a great prosperous and scientifically advanced nation smh tiny lactose pills laced with alcohol for all
india,not_removed,what else do you expect from a man who thinks his ancestors transplanted elephant heads on human bodies
india,not_removed,its not been demonstrated effective in any one thing yet the burden of proof lies with the claim that it has any efficacy whatsoever otherwise it is pseudoscience and garbage it currently shouldnt be used for any illnesses
india,not_removed,fever usually goes away overnight if it is just a response to a minor infection or inflammation
india,not_removed,thats how religion works
india,not_removed,basically the medical equivalent of a pyramid scheme of course indians being the gullible people that we are took it way too seriously and now theres homeopathy medical colleges and homeopaths can call themselves dr
india,not_removed,of course scientists those money guzzling vermin have nothing to contribute to the society john oliver said so we must all believe it s
india,not_removed,this is soooo valid was literally my first reaction when i read the post no one caring to question the study itself everyone jumping on the bandwagon and slating homeopathy
india,not_removed,you seem to have no idea how double blind trials work
india,not_removed,it is known
india,not_removed,no side effects unlike normal medicines anything with an effect can have side effects thats one of the problems with ayurveda the side effects arent well studied or well documented
india,not_removed,iirc some ayurvedic treatments have been found to have medical effectiveness and some not like for example i have cold right now and itll be healed by tomorrow morning no side effects unlike normal medicines seems likely it may help alleviate the symptoms
india,not_removed,its possible for ayurvedic medicines to work its not possible for homeopathy to work except through the placebo effect since the medicine is just water
india,not_removed,for your reference ayurved is outdated science it may be effective for few illness but cant trust it for matters of life and death not because it is wrong just outdated and not enough research for modern scenarios is done modern medicine allopathy is updated science the medicines undergoes trials for years sometimes and every effect is documented and improved i dont think there is any conflict between ayurved and modern medicine homeopathy is just fiction it cant even cure common cold
india,not_removed,dont know why you are being downvoted
india,not_removed,i know a number of young people who believe in reiki and magnetotherapy
india,not_removed,real potential very low testing and lack of congruity in practice ten regions of india give you twenty different plant species as the same jadibuti practice needs to be stopped till scientific studies are conducted but theres a huge potential to find useful medicine
india,not_removed,they just called it homeopathy in the west the guy who invanted homeopathy called it homeopathy and now gets confused with homeopathy in east wtf is homeopathy in the east
india,not_removed,then please explain to us the difference between eastern and western homoeopathy and how the latter is better andor not the same pseudoscientific quackle
india,not_removed,adding to your edit ayush is actually ayurveda yoga and naturopathy unani siddha and homeopathy
india,not_removed,like when you invent a disease that doesntcant exist ayurveda is acceptable for some cases but homoeopathy is not its pure placebo
india,not_removed,in these very very limited number of conditions homeopathy or ayurveda can be advised modern medicine can use placebo to treat such cases no need to feed the trolls
india,not_removed,what throat problem
india,not_removed,some placebo works even if you know its a placebo the brain is weird like that
india,not_removed,the most important thing in medicine is curing the patient not feelings or trust
india,not_removed,harm is when people progress to irreversible damage due to ineffectivet reatment
india,not_removed,lets discuss this old review of metanalyses of homeopathy shall we
india,not_removed,definition of a perfect reddit circlejerk its almost pavlovian
india,not_removed,the mentally defunct randia hivemind will now downvote you into oblivion also me because i agree with what you just said onehundred percent
india,not_removed,shivji was high as fuck to make such shit up man seriously its well know how much charas shiv used to smoke no wonder he started seeing elephant heads
india,not_removed,are you not an indian mama means mothers brother in most regions
india,not_removed,mamu re mamu
india,not_removed,kallu mama
india,not_removed,as someone said the person who demonstrates just once that homeopathy is effective will not only win the nobel in medicine but also in physics because homeopathy theory defies all known physics
india,not_removed,til ultimate deepthroat
india,not_removed,yep d chord
india,not_removed,that thing that is like a headphone except at the end of it is a hammer instead of a jack doctors carry it around
india,not_removed,religion is just a part of the predisposition towards faith humans inherently have in them there was a natgeo show where a group of ardent atheists were given harmless antique objects like watches jackets etc which they came to adore then they were told that these things belonged to serial killers and genocidal maniacs like hitler and their look suddenly changed they felt uncomfortable handling these items and were unnerved at the sight of them it was as if they believed that some of the essence of hitler transferred on to those objects even as a pure rationalist will dismiss any such transfer as ridiculous and unscientific thats what we are i am an atheist myself but i dont claim to be a rationalist although i am as rational as i can be ive met very few people who lack any element of belief at all all of us have it in some form or the other religion is just one aspect of this probably evolutionary tendency also at the end of the natgeo show the atheists were told that it was a bluff that those harmless objects belonged to real living harmless people which were the researchers themselves d the look on their faces was worth watching
india,not_removed,totally agree except for the part about indians being somehow more gullible were no worse than the idiots in europe or east asia
india,not_removed,hes not actually putting down scientists studies but the way the information is released and then blown out of proportion by the media
india,not_removed,what you are displaying here is confirmation bias oliver is railing against bad science not against all science there isnt a single peer reviewed study published in a respected scientificmedical journal showing efficacy of homeopathy there have been number of decent to good studies and their results range from homeopathy being harmless performing no better than placebo to being mildly harmful if you include all studies across journals you see a clear negative correlation between goodness of study design and execution and efficacy of homeopathy the papers showing homeopathy works come from homeopathy journals and are more of statements of belief rather than actual well controlled experiments
india,not_removed,that was supposed to be about studies taken out of context with cherry picked data as opposed to homeopathy which has been categorically debunked over the years
india,not_removed,either way this isnt the only study to prove this the bandwagon exists because it is a struggle to lose your friends and family because they believe in fake medicine
india,not_removed,you might wanna know what it means before you throw accusations placebos are part of blind experiments
india,not_removed,dont forget the unscrupulous homeopaths who add steroids in biologically active concentrations to their water making their patients feel good instantaneously while actually harming them
india,not_removed,for some reason many in east believe ayurveda of any home remedy is called homeopathy
india,not_removed,what he is saying is that we should not confuse homeopathy with ayurveda they are not the same
india,not_removed,in practice it is not uncommon for practitioners to come across patients who have spent quite a lot of money in doctor shopping with no recognisable clinical signs or symptoms and repeated diagnostic tests that have nothing to work on these patients have been shown to benefit from alternative medical systems many of these patients have dsmiii somatization who will require psychiatric attention at some point in time
india,not_removed,yes true but one of the cardinal pillars of modern medical bioethics is the principle of autonomy it is so important that the patient have the freedom to decide what is good for themselves modern medical doctors only seek to put all pertinent information to make that decision a large minority of people dont want to have anything to do with modern medicine you cant force them so we exercise toleration of other alternatives
india,not_removed,tonsillitis feeling of thorns in the throat and similar stuff
india,not_removed,yes i agree i am pointing out a fact that prince charles believes in it
india,not_removed,im not blaming the happy dude for seeing elephant heads on human bodies he probably said far out maan before proceding to bone the nearest moving thing his symbol is dick in a pussy ffs im only wondering what our dear leader smokes on daily basis to believe that his ancestors transplanted elephant heads on human torsos
india,not_removed,man it was a lame joke not be taken seriously
india,not_removed,homeopathy defies physics biology
india,not_removed,homeopaths arent allowed to call themselves doctors anywhere outside of india to my knowledge india is probably the only place where homeopathy has official sanction from the pm himself no less thats gullible to me i was just having this conversation the other day basically the only thing missing in the indian education system is critical thinking in fact most educated indians dont even know the meaning of critical thinking
india,not_removed,no point debating with people who have already concluded that they are right
india,not_removed,i know what it means when you do a double blind study half the sample size is placebos so if the people getting the actual stuff show x cure people taking placebos show y cure then the actual cure as determined by the study is considered as x y double blind studies eliminate the placebo effect so your original comment is meaningless
india,not_removed,i have never come across anyone who thinks ayurveda is homeopathy
india,not_removed,no i dont think thats what hes saying homeopathy is a specific way of treating disease by significantly diluting a medicine that is suppose to cure the disease they just called it homeopathy in the west and now gets confused with homeopathy in east
india,not_removed,you cant force them so we exercise toleration of other alternatives you cant force a patient to take medicine of any kind you as a government can and should get the quacks to shut shop rather than granting them officially sanctioned degrees allowing them to call themselves doctor if the paptient reads something on the internet and tries it on herself no one should prevent that but a ramdev claiming to cure dengue with aloe vera belongs in jail for murder
india,not_removed,so the swelling reduced or you got the surgery
india,not_removed,before all indians seek homeopathic treatment they should wait till homeopathy is used effectively on baby george
india,not_removed,he probably said far out maan before proceding to bone the nearest moving thing his symbol is dick in a pussy atheist or some other religion typical rationalist trying to debunk a religion by talking shit and trying to act correct but yeah anyway this one sub where insulting a particular religion can have no effect
india,not_removed,httpsimgsxkcdcomcomicspuritypng
india,not_removed,yes thanks man
india,not_removed,that may be true but other countries do utterly ridiculous shit that indians dont do the indian selfflagellation is getting tiresome trust me when i say there are going to be a lot of nonindians ready to give you all types of shit if you want you can lay back and take it easy on that
india,not_removed,what does that even mean you havent came across anybody then it must not be true let me give you a good way to understand this ask one of your relatives who has never been to us or europe ask him what homeopathy is i will bet that his definition of homeopathy will sound more like ayurveda than the actual definition that the west uses
india,not_removed,i am not wtf thats exactly what i am saying homeopathy is not ayurveda lots of people get confused with this
india,not_removed,it is not as simple as you suggest it to be shit is complicated for example who decides what is efficacious or even how do you define efficacy the gold standard in modern medicine is the randomised controlled trials rct which themselves have problems with biases that we are now increasingly dependent on pooled statistics from metaanalyses and you cant take the standard of modern medicine to qualify other alternative medical systems if ramdev claims dengue can be cured with aloe vera you just cant haul his ass to jail as much as even common sense let alone science might demand homeopathy claims that rcts are not the best way to study their efficiency heck doesnt even follow normal physics and chemistry ditto with ayurveda where reverse pharmacology is able to find limited efficiency for some drugs and mix in politics ethics anthropology into the mix it all becomes very complicated we are now talking about humanistic medicine where ethnopharmacology choices ethics etc all being to still further complicated things no my friend its all too fked up by the way i am a pharmacologist and pharmaceutical physician and these are huge problems in our speciality
india,not_removed,swelling was fixed when taking homeopathy but they were big enough even in normal conditions so got the surgery was not necessary had adenoids too so got them removed too in a separate surgery was necessary as they were causing my ear bones to dissolve
india,not_removed,you may perceive this as a an insult and that is your prerogative shiva on the other hand is the cool dude who would take it as a complement just dont cast your evil eye on his woman or his pot please explain what shivalingam is

india,not_removed,no all my relatives know the diff between ayurveda and homeopathy
india,not_removed,if ramdev claims dengue can be cured with aloe vera you just cant haul his ass to jail you can if his proselytizing about it prevents a patient from going to a qualified physician and causes his death small time roadside quacks have been jailed for killing their patients so why not quacks practicing homeopathy or noodle baba are you suggesting that it is our belief is a statement enough to qualify anyone as a medical practitioner yes there are issues with medical trials as they are run right now and there are constant efforts to improve the system the argument that the modern emperical testing methodology is not perfect is not an argument to allow a quack to call himself a doctor that is an argument for figuring out how to improve the system personalized medicine based on better understanding at molecular and genetic level rather than empirically trying one drug after another for one is changing things for example homeopathy claims that rcts are not the best way to study their efficiency heck doesnt even follow normal physics and chemistry just because a bhondu tells you he has visited mars in a gobar powered vimana that statement does not become true nor do the laws of physics cease to exist hokeopathy here is making extraordinary claims and as such requires extraordinary evidence short of which the quackery stands exposed again im not saying that a patient reading about homeopathy on the internet and trying to self medicate needs to be stopped you are free to kill yourself with your stupidity what i am saying is that the government has no business legitimizing commercial exploitation of the gullible by recognizing the quack degrees rest of your comment basically just amounts to mumbo jumbo and hence throwing in the towel
india,not_removed,so its the swelling not the tonsilitis that the homeopathy fixed 🤔
india,not_removed,face palms
india,not_removed,you can if his proselytizing about it prevents a patient from going to a qualified physician and causes his death stawman my point was simple the issues around these are complicated the issues are governed by many laws precedents and rulings that including among others constitutional right to livihood drugs and cosmetics act the drugs and magic remedies objectionable advertisements act etc small time roadside quacks have been jailed for killing their patients so why not quacks practicing homeopathy or noodle baba if that is seriously a question you are asking you can search whole corpus of judgements on httpsindiankanoonorg please do go ahead a do a little research let us know what you find rest of your comment basically just amounts to mumbo jumbo i cannot continue to have a conversation with you since you obviously are oblivious to what i am talking about in a word ignoramus you are free to argue against my views but please do so civilly and i would deign to engage in a dialogue if it is interesting
india,not_removed,tonsillitis is swellinginflammation of tonsils im not agreeing with homeopathy as a cure but your question makes no attempt to counter the issue
india,not_removed,was just trying to find out what it actually cured not trying to counter him or anything

india,not_removed,anyway a word of advice to people going on road trips never stop the car if someone tries to ask for help on highways if they appear genuine stop the car little bit far away and then ask them to come to your car my friends and i were coming from bidar karnataka to hyderabad telangana and there was a santro in middle of fuck all and a dude flagging down cars it was full of trees on either side and i dont know but i got a gut feeling and i noped the fuck out of there friends asked me why i didnt stop and i really had no answer other than bad feeling cue one month and we saw a highway robbery in newspapers near the place where we were stopped
india,not_removed,castrate these fucks with sulphuric acid i would be happy to help fuck that moral changing shit these guys deserve worse than hell
india,not_removed,imagine its you its your family traveling together imagine your mother and your teenage sister being gangraped in front of you for three hours by close to men welcome to the shithole called india now please google up and find me statistics from sweden or usa and tell me how it is worse there every single indian female has a horror story to tell every single one i have known who knows maybe my own sister was raped by a relative probably i will never know what i do know is this is one of the worst countries for a female to be born into
india,not_removed,breed like rats then rape women until we stop fucking breeding this will continue stop fucking breeding billion enough

india,not_removed,western up especially the border areas of delhi are dangerous at night dominated by jats gujjar muslim and sc criminal gangs years ago these were dirt poor rural areas villages now these are part of greater delhi and land prices have made the poor farmers rich and their kids now form these gangs
india,not_removed,saare jahaan se achha
india,not_removed,a gang of a dozen robbers gangraped a noida woman and her daughter for close to three hours near bulandshahr late friday night the rape survivors were headed for shahjahanpur from noida and driving down the delhikanpur national highway with four of their family this was when the attackers emerged and took the family at gunpointthe robbers forced the driver to pull off the road and drive into a slushy field isolated the four others of the family andand her daughter we have formed six teams three of them headed by circle officers to probe the case and have launched a manhunt dig meerut range lakshmi singh said a case has been lodged against unknown men under sections d gangrape robbery or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt and punishment for dacoity this departmental probe will be conducted by the sp crime ghaziabad police saiddig singh said the crime seemed to be the handiwork of a particular rajasthan tribe here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,shit edit sorry i know the voting buttons are there for a purpose and posting content to a discussion isnt fair to anyones time but this is all i have to say its painful
india,not_removed,whats appalling is the chutiya conclusions reached by the police modus operandi of a tribe from rajasthan what the fuck last i checked theres no concept of a criminal castetribe anymore also this seems to be an attempt to shield local criminals and instead round up some nomadic gypsies as the perpetrators
india,not_removed,and even in this you have british rule apologists in the comment section over there saying india was more civilised under british rule
india,not_removed,never stop the car if someone tries to ask for help what a sad country we live in incredible india
india,not_removed,castrate them like vets use to do it to bulls in earlier days
india,not_removed,couldnt agreee more unless we all collectively accept it fuckall will change
india,not_removed,in incredible india i read a old rape story once every week in the newspaper this country is hopeless especially up and its neighbors
india,not_removed,give a break every single indian female has a horror story to tell in this context is a gross exaggeration your point of west being safer for women is true undeniably but dont exaggerate to the million females living here lets stick with the sheer horror of this incident
india,not_removed,theres no magic switch to control population itll come under control gradually overtime well reach our peak around and reduce from there on what can be done instead is to do something about the sexually repressed ie to legalize prostitution itll help the thousands who are in the trade and reduce the no of rapes
india,not_removed,until we stop fucking breeding this will continue yeah blame the family that was the victim why did they reproduce never mind the failed gobernance
india,not_removed,that goes against the narrative of incredible india
india,not_removed,it doesnt work that way police is not trying to shield perpetrators in all the cases and imho police does get strict in such cases especially with the rise of media awareness as for tribes you will be surprised to learn that the concept of modus operandi is very valid it is not about labelling the entire tribe as criminals an approach adopted by the british but to find the criminals and these are legitimate methods to narrow down the subjects anyways that is just my opinion and i am not an investigator feel free to ignore
india,not_removed,police generally knows about the kind of gangs active in the area and how they operate also how they look based upon the description provided by victims although there arent any criminal tribes but people from certain communities and villages are involved in organised crime as a family business they move from one place to another and you hear a spate of crimes from the region these gangs move to my parents were attacked on the highway by a gang of such people the gang threw stones at the car to somehow make them stop however my dads driver was pretty smart and he didnt lose cool and accelerated despite the windshield collapsing thankfully they escaped parents had gone for shopping for a wedding in the family and were carrying lots of jewellery and cash these gangs many times beat up and injure victims even if the victims cooperate their logic is that if they dont exert physically by beating up victims they dont deserve the loot these people have no sense of morality the way they are brought up intact in gujarat riots the rioting hindu groups called in such people to do the dirty work of killing muslims
india,not_removed,the bishnoi trjbe is notorious for incidents like these ask any rajasthani
india,not_removed,i know i sound pessimistic but this is shaped by my personal experience im not saying every one asking for help is bad but it pays to be vigilant i myself was stuck few times with coolant leak puncture etc and couple of kind souls gave a life to nearby village and back with mechanic so not every one is bad but it pays to be vigilant is all im saying
india,not_removed,he gave an alternative solution stop it a bit behind and ask them to comeoften the trap works on a surprise element if you see the accomplice running at you from far away you can turn your car and nope the fuck out
india,not_removed,well i see a large number of child rape stories from bangalore certainly isnt up and its neighbors
india,not_removed,if it is not every female in india it has to be a close number and i speak this as a guy
india,not_removed,i disagree no matter what the form most females have been molested in rural india in urban individual the numbers might be less but remain significant enough most dont share with men as most indian men majority pop is not reddit dont give a fuck unless society finds out about it
india,not_removed,oh come on dont start with not all shit we all fucking know the condition of females in india weve gotta fucking accept it instead of bringing in more reforms for a fucking cow nothingagainstcowilovebeef
india,not_removed,let females be a judge of what i am saying maybe i am an exception but all females who have confided in me have had a horror story to tell
india,not_removed,dont underestimate it
india,not_removed,the fact of the matter is that many indian females are either raped gangraped groped or sexually harassed at least once in their lives and it will get worse and worse every year because of indias uncontrollable birth rate
india,not_removed,men gets killed much much more than women and kids in more brutal manner have you got killed a girl your age in india has probably been molested or raped if you honestly think that men have it worse in india try stepping out of your basement for a change fu you with your gender and antiindia politics if you follow my comment history you will see that i consider myself a nationalist i am rightwinger for others here yet i do not bury my head in the sand like you seem to be doing saare jahan se accha is not a reality it is the ultimate aim towards which we all should strive india is a shithole the earlier you acknowledge it the earlier you can resolve to change it

india,not_removed,they are but they are seen as rowdy perverted and misogynistic thugs in rajasthan i have no idea why
india,not_removed,are raped in this country forget year olds

india,not_removed,everything you know about south asian pink flamingos is false a prominent nuclearweapons expert has recently warned pakistans expanding nuclear arsenal first it conveys the impression that india is a responsible nuclear power with a public pledge to not use nuclear weapons first if you do count the tactical nuclear attack as a first use then your deterrence calculations should factor the possibility of a third use of nuclear weapons by the adversary as menon says it must pakistans tactical nuclear weapons do not change this posture it is more likely that pakistan would use a large fraction of its nuclear weapons at once in a massive first strike near simultaneously with its tactical nuclear weapons use against india thereby making its possession and threat to use of these weapons irrelevant here are some other news itemscredits to ha nem akar várni már töltheti a windows httpswwwopendemocracynetcaneuropemakeitdimitrischristopouloshumanrightsinstateofperpetualemergency im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,does it really matter
india,not_removed,yes because any change in nuclear doctrine into a more aggressive posture brings changes to the mad equation and hence is destabilizing if india were to change it then china will be forced to consider a change and if india changes it then it has to ramp up production of nukes for first strike requirements and that creates another cycle
india,not_removed,yes if the nca were to create enough ambiguity in their posture and convey that they intend to strike at pakistani nasr batteries preparing for launch they will have effectively neutralised the pakistani response to cold start
india,not_removed,ok then maintaining the status quo seems wiser
india,not_removed,kinda curious do we have the intel to locate the pakistani batteries
india,not_removed,how if india strikes at nasr batteries then pakistan will strike back with strategic nukes mainly because all we have are strategic nukes so now we have gone from eating tactical nukes to eating strategic nukes in order for india to change the nuclear doctrine it needs to massively increase its nuclear arms production pakistan has nukes and a lot of them are mobile we would actually need to hit a large majority of them and neutralize them in addition to nasr batteries if we are to be safe from a second strike not to mention pakistan is also working on submarine launched cruise missiles too the amount of missiles required for that will probably irradiate a large part of north india too something that we are keen to avoid and there is no guarantee that some missiles do not survive our first strike or will be taken down by the missile defense systems and all this assumes that pakistan does not respond to these changes by tweaking their own doctrines and everything goes according to plan which it seldom does
india,not_removed,note what follows is all khayali pulao us mango civvies do not have access to the info necessary for coming to firmish conclusions pakistan striking indian cities with strategic nukes was always the foremost threat to india the most widely accepted scenario unfolded something like this india attacks along a wide front and develops a very real threat to lahoreryksukkurmirpur khaswhatever pakistan on the backfoot and staring its destruction in the face attempts to halt the indian advance by nuking a mechanised formation thus killing any indian offensive in the region during parakram this would have been done by an aircraft now its a ballistic missile this could conceivably lead to three outcomes india pulls back either due to massive international pressure or to to avoid a larger nuclear exchange having achieved nothing of significance pakistan claims a victory pyrrhic though it is india responds by hitting back at a similar pakistan formation the problem is since all the fighting is happening in pakistani territory close to urban areas it is virtually impossible for india to avoid inflicting damage on a population centre this sparks off a massive retaliatory exchange india actually follows through on her doctrine and massive retaliation happens depending on how much of the pakistani arsenal survives the attack it could in the worst case scenario cause pakistan to retaliate in kind not a single of these outcomes was seen to result in a net benefit for india having a war go nuclear itself spelt failure since it meant that india could no longer use her superior conventional forces to achieve lasting strategic benefits and as long as pakistan continued to lower the threshold on nuclear weapons use india was strategically checkmated possibly someone in the decision making chain felt that was no way india could outplay pakistan in this game with purely conventional force also it is important to note that the government sees the military primarily as a coercive and not warfighting tool india is a statusquoist power and does not intend to use the military in wars on expansion so it is important to deny the pakistanis the ability to stave off such coercion spreading fud on what indias real intentions are and by hinting that a counterforce first strike is very much on the cards does just that at the very least it provides enough cover for smallscale strikes that otherwise wouldnt have been possible under a nuclear backdrop fwiw imho and all standard disclaimers apply

india,not_removed,if you want to learn about basics of stock markets then i think this website has a lot of good info which is relevant to indian stock markets give it a try httpzerodhacomvarsity
india,not_removed,stocks and investments are things that you dont have direct control they are often subjected to unforseen market hysterias create a source of income that you have direct control over such as content managements freelance product creation there are a the things that make great money
india,not_removed,if you are sincere about investing i suggest picking up a book by aswath damodaran he is a legend in the field of finance and is a great teacher you can also start following his youtube channel which is great and his blogs the idea is to get hold of the fundamental concepts behind stock valuation and then finding your way you can start right away
india,not_removed,im invested in real estate easier to flip houses than track stock markets

india,not_removed,web application development mostly over the past year my interest in data has increased
india,not_removed,on and off since college days so thats like years but recently realized crunches n sit ups dont help much planks is the answer probably
india,not_removed,im gonna be in india for the next months does that count o
india,not_removed,yes thanks for highlighting
india,not_removed,yeah hate to break it but no one can learn really learn a language using duo ive done half my education in french and i still sometimes ges confused on duo
india,not_removed,duolingo is quite shit for learning by itself its a great tool and i use it but you will need other resources you will never be able to understand a language properly by just duo and if you use duo be sure to check the discussions as much as possible as they are more useful than the app by itself i started with clasroom coaching as it was an elective in college but it was quite basic and it has ended now i use a few ebooks and few other learning websites and audio tutorials and also duolingo too duo doesnt teach proper grammar in my experience if you know and understand grammar maybe duo is a little more helpful for vocab
india,not_removed,movies are great for vocabulary building not useful if you already dont know grammar and basics of a language i havent yet started watching french movies but ill start soon now
india,not_removed,its difficult to get fluent in any language some people study english throughout school years and can still barely speak by the end of it
india,not_removed,speaking and understanding french speakers is much more difficult french pronounciation is super weird reading and understanding is relatively easier once you understand most of the rules
india,not_removed,in my mind
india,not_removed,thanks made my day
india,not_removed,khun ki pyasi bulbulsan diegocalifornia
india,not_removed,i got a wildcraft bag for in my grade dad told me ill be using it till i complete engineering six months left to graduate and the bag is still strong no zip faults but just a little dirty
india,not_removed,its an american tourister laptop bagpack not leather i purchased for and is quite hybrid in its usecase i have abused it for almost every purpose and there is still no sign of physical damage the material is water repellent and comes with a water resistant cover for heavy rains unfortunately i couldnt find the exact thing online few months back
india,not_removed,i got a case logic bag in mid and its still as good as new despite heavy use no noticeable wearteardamage at all i machine wash it about twice a year is all would recommend
india,not_removed,i used an aoking one for years it didnt go broke or anything i just wanted a new bag that shit was immortal plus it had really good padding and wouldnt let one drop of water in during the rains
india,not_removed,i would have added reddit to the list but i feel reddit is more informative and for the most part content is filtered well there are also many informative subreddits its all about subscribing to the right subs
india,not_removed,thanks for this realised this after your post so ill be doing it as well
india,not_removed,i actually activated fb a coupe of months backeverything seemed to be static from over a year earlier same bullshit same pictures saw that one acquaintance had passed away decided to nope out of fb and deactivated again instagram im still on but most people i know dont use it so mostly follow basketball teams and it isnt as bad for now as someone said in this thread reddit seems to have replaced fb time so ill try to cut it a bit this year its getting quite bad actually and i think my boss may say something about it soon p
india,not_removed,sharmagkabeta same here
india,not_removed,let me warn you tho duolingo will teach you german but the very bones of german it will teach you the words and very very basic grammer id recommend going to a tutor if possible over using duolingo duo is good for the initial phase but if you want to be fluent in deutsch you may need a proper tutor source used duo
india,not_removed,sounds nice kindly share more info im interested in doing a masters in em too
india,not_removed,rnofap been months pretty confident about myself

india,not_removed,check out joyetech aio starter kit on vapemantracom that or the ijust starter kit both are very basic pick up a strong nic content ejuice something like six or nine mg in nic content would suggest you to join the fb group the great india vaping community and buy flavours from the sellers there would recommend the seller murtaza ali there every friday is sale day vapemantra guys gives the best prices compared to the other guys who charge too much if you want something a bit more advanced would suggest you to pick up the nautilus mini or nautilus x tank pick up a eleaf istick power pop it at around fifteen watts pick up a bunch of spare coils this has a similar draw to a cigarette please dont pick up anything more advanced than these ive seen too many people who go to complicated setups get over whelmed and pick up smoking again many vapers tell beginners to go for the setups advanced vapers use dont fall that trap also few more things no such thing as cheat smoke you quit you quit dont rely too much on nicotine dont get too comfortable keep on weaning down to i relapsed to nicotine vaping in between and immediately weaned down to in months pick up spare coils dont use the excuse of not having coils to smoke forget your device at home once in a while
india,not_removed,youve to basically do zero nic vape and use it to battle urges slowly can phase out vaping right now i barley vape just take a drag here and there have around of juice wont buy more juice i did cold turkey for the first week broke off smoking clean and then picked up a vape when i was getting a hint of a relapse
india,not_removed,yeah but there are some rules related to this specific to the university youre in for ex in lnmiit where i am currently at you can take lateral transfer in second year after completing first year in your college you need to have cgpa and need to satisfy the cutoffs of branches of lnmiit jee mains marks
india,not_removed,reddit has a very specific demographic and is less visual i go to fb for the more diverse demographic atleast women more artsy types etc
india,not_removed,ja das ist richtig
india,not_removed,this is just as bad
india,not_removed,amazinng dude go on i am on it too
india,not_removed,did mba because of parental pressure directly joined after engineering i really want to give decent attempts for upsc ill try and prepare with the job as the lakh loan makes it impossible to take a complete drop i just dont want to reach my thinking what would have been if only i had followed my dreams instead of doing what my parents wanted
india,not_removed,content management systems are nothing but blogs create a blog where you can teach people the stuff you are good at or a youtube channel and monetize it to earn product creation is creating a product in your area of expertise such as software systems services anything that the market requires now how can you find out what people need research about market economy culture trends that people like and retrofit the requirements thats missing this is little difficult in the beginning and you wont get this knowledge on the internet you need to subsume yourself within the people in the field

india,not_removed,they may still win aaps appeal is in kejriwal channeling peoples disgust with established political parties and positioning himself as an alternative in their minds this is how they won delhi kejriwal was their only face local leaders and candidates did not matter much and consequently many people who would have been otherwise unelectable became mlas on aap tickets i dont blame kejriwal for thinking the same strategy would work in punjab at least to some extent it does he is probably planning to make the jump to punjab as cm after the elections leaving sisodia in charge of delhi he can say the people want me so i am coming to chandigarh and shift his attention to that state
india,not_removed,if you talk to ground level supporters of aap most of them are feeling very dejected and i am talking about those who worked for aap before kejriwal won in delhi the second time a lot of new members in aap are just their because they know aap is going to win and they might get a chance to capture some post nodoubt aap has the highest probability of winning punjab elections but many of its members who have got a ticket or are in process of getting a ticket is purely based on money and power to capture votes dharamvir gandhi sucha singh harinder singh khalsa were the people who worked hard and made a name for aap in punjab and all of them have been expelled there is a talk going on that aap will come to power most probably kejriwal will become cm then a year or two later corruption or some other charges will come out against some of these elected members like in delhi kejriwal has failed in delhi partly due to centers intervention and partly due to his tremendous hate against modi but in punjab he wont have the same excuse next five years will either see aap changing face of punjab or becoming another i am here just for votes political party
india,not_removed,in a way i actually want him to do that aap supporters keep cribbing that modi is cramping kejriwals style but by moving to punjab he would have more autonomy and power right now any and all failure can be laid at lgs feetespecially with the hc ruling they wont have such excuses in punjab and we can see what aap and especially kejriwal can do
india,not_removed,it does not matter what party leaders or ground level workers feel what matters is how voters feel so long as aap is still a big hit with voters it will have no shortage of people ready to do party work or seeking tickets for elections simply because they need to advance their political careers anyone who is in it for principles and feels dejected with kejriwal is replaceable

india,not_removed,on rajdeep sardesai while the riots are going on when media involvement usually forces the government to act when bad things can be prevented through press intervention one of our countrys premier journalists based out of delhi parrots the trinamool congress line and denies the riots he subsequently then puts around riots in the same way i have put it around journalist in the preceding sentence on media coverage the irony of this kind of targeted censorship is that it ends up hurting the very agenda that is close to their hearts since the media will try its level best not to report a particular type of communal violence it then becomes very easy for hindu fanatics to cook up or grossly exaggerate incidents of communal violence then use social media to spread their message and people will be more inclined to believe whatever they get on their fb walls or whatsapp the lack of coverage in mainstream media perversely validating the story if the news channels arent covering this it must be true

india,not_removed,man still months away from iphone
india,not_removed,it is generally believed that the exynos processors have better cpus with losing out on the gpus when compared to the snapdragon processors also given that the exynos is better integrated with the other components of samsung as it is their own processor yes the custom development is bad for the exynos processor variant as there is little to no documentation provided for it but i remember that the sd variants have a locked bootloader so custom dev is difficult for that aswell overall do not worry that you have the exynos variant as it is better than the sd unless you are into a lot of games the feature parity is there and there is nothing that you are losing out on just because of the processor
india,not_removed,anyone out there would like to share their thought on this question
india,not_removed,exynos is faster than the and also probably more efficient also in house processor means almost excellent optimization as far as i know this time they are also getting a great gpu with it so you wont be losing out on mobile gaming
india,not_removed,then why the fuck did they force qualcomm for sd supply chain just for thats the reason why lg has last years sd 😡
india,not_removed,for them the us and china are bigger markets than other countries and sd is required in the us for the cdma bands used there the yields of and on the die size is from what i read is really low so its not like they have many chips to sell to different manufacturers and also this exclusivety is only for the initial batch had lg waited they could get their hands on the like what htc is doing nothing really to fret about the is no slouch either so the should not have a problem
india,not_removed,india should take africa more seriously not for cultural engagement but because it is the last great untapped market subsaharan africa has been growing at pa for many years it has lots of resources that india and the rest of the world need there are excellent trade oppurtunties for indian and africa that is why india should take africa more seriously
india,not_removed,its not racism which drives this but many instances of drug peddling fraud and general hooliganism by certain people of nigerian descent in indian cities not at all supporting the mobs but ignoring facts is very very biased approach towards news edit in no way am i supporting it justifying the attacks in noida im only saying that not mentioning these incidents gives an incomplete picture to readers the incident though deplorable is reactionary and the context must be understood medias job is to report news we will interpret it as we should
india,not_removed,a far wider cultural engagement with the continent is necessary to combat the latent racism among indians this incident followed by further violence against african students in noida marks a new low in the racism faced by africans in india concerned by the racism faced by many african students mr peasah helped organise a peace march to raise awareness about racism in india students on indian campuses must be made aware of racism towards foreign students and shown that it is no different from the racism faced by indian students abroad which india so vehemently denounces in addition for a country of indias size and given the increasing number of africans coming to india to study and for medical tourism a far wider cultural engagement with the continent is necessary not only to combat the malevolent racism but also to expand the global horizons of the indian public im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,its very important to have some sort of community integration programs in places where africans live some kind of monthly get togethers staring food music etc these simple things go a long way in bridging mistrust i dont know how capable african embassies are but mea and police should involve them too also lets have more africans on tv i also think there might be a problem in our text books they contain a lot of outdated colonial era rehashed and recycled bullshit like the use of the word negro to refer to africans most people dont even know how wrong that is the latent racism in india is based on these tropes about africans in the longer run we have to live look at this
india,not_removed,exactly the chinese are already there
india,not_removed,even if out of nigerians coming to india are criminals that is no excuse for the kind of barbaric savagery displayed this is a civilised country and these racist thugs should have filed a police complaint that is all the facts that are relevant
india,not_removed,this is such a fucked up view to have by the same logic men need to be subjected to biased laws against them because some men are rapists the actions of a few cannot be taken as a benchmark for the entire group
india,not_removed,chinese silently got their hands on a lot of african projects many of which theyve already finished trade deals and mines while india and the rest of the world wasnt paying attention it will surely be too late by the time india tries to step foot into africa
india,not_removed,yup i agree
india,not_removed,thats not what i said but not reporting those incidents gives an incomplete picture
india,not_removed,it will surely be too late by the time india tries to step foot into africa no way indians speak english and so do most educated africans indian services such as engineering and construction it will be similar to the exports from southern india to the middle east very few people like doing business with the chinese i own a house in china and chinese is the main language spoke at my home tl dr it is an excellent time for india to start trading with africa food and technology are huge opportunities

india,not_removed,there is no silver bullet but heres at least one suggestion focus more on eradicatingor at least reforming caste in rural areas the wb did a study a few years back where they compared rates of open defecation in south asian countries bangladesh had something like whereas india was at over what they wrote was that a major reason is casteuntouchability issues even in homes where they had installed toilets it wasnt always used since you have to clean it from time to time and poor people dont have maids so they have to do it themselves this is a nofrills issue in western countries you clean up after yourself its basic common sense but in india due to caste you have these barriers therefore while building toilets will undoubtedly make some headway you wont be able to eradicate open defecation until you adress caste headon and that will take time and more importantly serious effort so far the modi government has treated this as a technocratic problem just build x amounts of toilets and it will solve itself will a bjpled government tackle issues of caste which requires selfcriticism of your own religion dont hold your breath

india,not_removed,i have said this before too waste management infrastructure needs to be built and maintained presently its barely enough to sweep it under the rug
india,not_removed,the only way to clean india is to change peoples mindset about cleanliness you can condition mindset of kids by showing them making them take part in reallife practicals about bad and good habbits for cleanliness but changing mindset of adults will be far more difficult maybe declaring bad habits to be against god coud help like how people dont eat nonveg food on a particular day of the week because it is against certain god this is the only thing that coud work with adults in both cases it will take a long time
india,not_removed,this maybe just anecdotal evidence but some indians are just not bothered by all the dirt and filth unless its within their property just a few months back a new apartment building has been constructed on the opposite side of our house and new tenants have moved in some of them collect their vegetable and kitchen waste in polythene packets and throw it on the street the area is daily served by municipal garbage collectors who come at around am these people are not bothered to get out of bed and throw it in the garbage cart edit indians are called streetshitters in many corners of reddit but the shit on city streets are actually from the huge number of stray dogs and cats does any civilised country allow cities to be overrun by such a huge number of strays
india,not_removed,small change of attitude i recall after starting to work thanks soft skill sessions i first realized that littering was wrong a major tourist place outside india fellow indian couple in front of me just threw thrash while standing in the queue for an attraction we were all in line for needless to say it drew stares before it would snowball i had to ask them to pick it up and use a dustbin what stuck with me was the look on her face when she just threw the thrash a mix of i know i am doing something wrong for sure no one say anything what i found absolutely mind blowing was that the girl in question did not even had the decency to pick the thrash back up it was done by her bfhusband from the govt we need them to privatize the loo business and get one in every public transport center bus rail highway loos with refill stations

india,not_removed,please op just admit that you dont care about the poor affording luxury goods this is about your purchases of luxury goods becoming more expensive
india,not_removed,op lets understand your idea of the luxury goods poor people can buy
india,not_removed,i thought they are raising taxes on everything
india,not_removed,of india pays income tax but everyone spends money lets get some tax from there i think thats the idea there
india,not_removed,i i think you have a different sense of what luxury taxes are even the middle class doesnt care about luxuries let alone poor people ii if you are talking about the increasing service taxescesscleanliness tax etc those are proportional to the amount spent since poor people are not paying income taxes i dont think it is fair that they should get free ride on services they can afford iii this govt has majority of schemes directed towards the poor while the tax burden has been increased equally across all classes iv do you have a more effective way of taxing the richtaxevading populace of india which would be contributing the majority of amount to luxury taxes
india,not_removed,i cringe a little whenever i see the words castesystem some illogical bullshit always follows this post unfortunately is no exception
india,not_removed,dumbest post of today go look up what luxuries and poor mean in the indian context
india,not_removed,if they can afford luxuries theyre not poor taxes on luxury items are one of the few ways to tax the wealthy disproportionately what about the luxury taxes implemented in the us and europe are those somehow also trying to create a caste system
india,not_removed,thats the sole effect of a sin tax i dont think they are that malicious
india,not_removed,on the bright side lets hope the luxury businesses get competitive and lower their actual rates lets give it some time and see if the movie theaters restaurants isps lower their charges to balance out the tax hike of course this is a laughable thought but you never know what this is gonna lead to right off the bat
india,not_removed,being poor is a mindset according to modihe feels that people can afford to give up lpg subsidy so that ambaniadani blah blah could live in comfort and not the poor people whod still have to purchase gas at standard rates he is a gujrati who caters business clans of gujratis and marwadishence the bullet train is ahmedabadmumbai because gujratis frequent these routeshence comfortand modi personally hates to see poor people hences makes a feet distance from themforget about their comfortthey are just vote banks with his theatrics and crocodile tears
india,not_removed,i think by luxuries you mean services is it and yes the outing to the nearby restaurant at a special occasion would become a rarity
india,not_removed,raising tax on goods the wealthy tend to spend more on with proportion to their income is a way to generate revenue at their expense moreso than at the expense of lower income demographics who may still see the same or greater benefit from investment of that revenue toward development those living below poverty line will spend virtually of their income on luxuries i dont think all luxuries are created equal in this respect either mobile phones and similar electronics probably shouldnt be taxed extra even for the poor they are a necessity nowadays but not cars and heck even softdrinks should be considered luxury imo at least we wont go as quickly down the obesity rabbit hole as the rest of the developed world
india,not_removed,do electronics come under the new raised luxury tax stuff like graphic cardshddscpus
india,not_removed,taxes as of today stand at they are just preparing the ground for gst post which taxes would stand at around so that it doesnt come as a shock

india,not_removed,i see people ranting about op posting such a topic just because he has to pay more taxes come on people dont be so naive im sure he posted this with good intentions and sympathy for the poor
india,not_removed,isnt the tax on luxuries good for the poor wouldnt this tax money allow the government to keep some other essential commodities price lower i dont think a luxury tax and a new castesystem are related in any way
india,not_removed,not really im rich
india,not_removed,his idea of poor are college students from middle class families
india,not_removed,ive seen poor people go to restaurants from time to time order take out food purchase mobile phones use the internet
india,not_removed,how else are they going to pay for those desh badal raha hain ads its india shining all over again
india,not_removed,more so on luxuries than anything else
india,not_removed,how about they start collecting taxes from the businessmen for starters the salaried class pays for the sins of the business class
india,not_removed,wasted post ops very idea of what constitutes poor or luxury in india seems very off
india,not_removed,i think you have a different sense of what luxury taxes are even the middle class doesnt care about luxuries let alone poor people eating out at restaurants going to movies using the internet are luxuries especially in developing countries im not saying this this is pretty much what the government says if you are talking about the increasing service taxescesscleanliness tax etc those are proportional to the amount spent since poor people are not paying income taxes i dont think it is fair that they should get free ride on services they can afford youre missing a key aspect taxes are mostly supposed to be for the benefit of the poor this govt has majority of schemes directed towards the poor while the tax burden has been increased equally across all classes majority of these schemes have been to give the poor the ability to have basic needs and that is all do you have a more effective way of taxing the richtaxevading populace of india yes taxes should be made onlineonly middlemen should be completely eliminated
india,not_removed,what is the logical way to talk about caste system
india,not_removed,ive seen families save up money for things like someones birthday so that they go get to a nice restaurantluxurious according to their standards i think what op meant was scenarios like this
india,not_removed,but if a business is targeting a group of individuals which come from money an increase in tax might not effect their sales at all
india,not_removed,movie theatres internet and restaurants are luxuries til
india,not_removed,being poor is a mindset hmm where else have i heard this
india,not_removed,to be fair people are being cynical not naive its actually safer to assume that im only posting for selfish motives while i admit that theyre totally wrong about my motives as ive explained in other comments i can not fault them for making such assumptions thank you for showing some faith in me though
india,not_removed,im rich and frugal so this is not at all about the poor people its all about you having to pay extra for luxury items you dont give two shits about poor people so dont try to pretend
india,not_removed,op lets understand your idea of poor people now
india,not_removed,they are not poor mobile phones maybe but we are talking phones at a max the poor in india live in under a day which doesnt give you scope for anything really
india,not_removed,advertisement cess
india,not_removed,guess they should i too hate paying for the businessmen and those fake farmers
india,not_removed,youre missing a key aspect taxes are mostly supposed to be for the benefit of the poor sorry that doesnt compute
india,not_removed,in whiny rants complaining about reservation stealing opportunities
india,not_removed,well they can still do so theyll have to save a little bit more to pay the tax on that its certainly not meant to create a caste system thats crazy the people that will disproportionately have to pay that tax over and over and over are the wealthy that regularly go out to eat at a nice restaurant those are obviously the people we want to tax more is it not and that motivation actually would be the opposite of trying to create a caste system wouldnt it
india,not_removed,swacch bharat cess adds paisa for rs charged the new krishi kalyan cess adds another paisa for rs charged so if this poor family has saved up rs to eat out now they need to save up rs i am sure the rs is not going to bust their budget
india,not_removed,this is what i meant thank you
india,not_removed,that is a good thing the government then will earn more from taxes
india,not_removed,isps have been dropping prices and offering better speeds for a while now
india,not_removed,i dont think anyone has said that ever
india,not_removed,i am going to become captain obvious here

india,not_removed,raagaaragaga romaromamamaa gagaoohlala want your bad romance
india,not_removed,randi goverment
india,not_removed,not frugal either im not in the least bit bothered by taxes okay maybe a tiny bit but thats too negligible to prompt me to make posts like these if i was bothered by taxes id evade considering how easy it is to do so if one isnt a salary man but im not really bothered even with taxes my needs and my desires are fulfilled but its amusing that youd resort to attacking me instead of the post how adorable
india,not_removed,i dont think op knows what it is to be poor in india this smacks of a if they cant have bread let them eat cake type attitude
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,people who live from handtomouth and can only afford the most basic amenities sometimes not even that much
india,not_removed,they want to look for the black money in switzerland and panama but its all around us in india
india,not_removed,rs if the planned budget was rs previously
india,not_removed,lady gaga
india,not_removed,are we talking about urban poor those people who are earning lots but wasting money on brands and hence have no money left do you not care about the actual poor who are hardly earning daily wages do not share anything just for the sake of arguments
india,not_removed,then be happy because government is not applying taxes on the basic amenities government is applying taxes on luxury items they are called luxury items because they are not affordable by everyone not even middle class forget poor
india,not_removed,i know thati do buy a kot of computer componentsbut being charged for a rpi is just a myth in the end its upto one how they declare it in customsi have imported server components like xeons over while not paying a single dime to customsdeclare it as a gift of a lower value if you paste the actual cost on the outside they are going to charge a lot
india,not_removed,i should have added the s
india,not_removed,so the middle class cant afford to go to movie theaters and malls and restaurants its amusing how you presume to lecture me when being ignorant as to what constitutes luxury
india,not_removed,that wouldnt have made sense sarcasm isnt going completely offtopic
india,not_removed,you are talking about poor in this post so let us talk about poor
india,not_removed,ah yes so people who cant even survive on their own are the only people who can be poor im not sure you even know what the word means

india,not_removed,its good that we are trying to help but then why didnt these workers already leave saudi
india,not_removed,late in the evening external affairs minister sushma swaraj appealed to lakhs indians in that country to help their fellow brothers and sisters asserting that there is nothing mightier than the collective will of the indian nation new delhi india has despatched v k singh and m j abkar the ministers of state in the external affairs ministry to negotiate with saudi and kuwaiti authorities on behalf of outofwork indians who have been pushed to the edge of starvationover the past three days the government has organised emergency rations for theat the indian embassy in riyadh and the consulate in jeddah we have asked indianembriyadh to provide free ration to the unemployed indian workers in saudi arabia she tweeted i assure you that no indian worker rendered unemployed in saudi arabia will go without food she saidthe ministers have been tasked with finding a way out for the workers who are in a deep financial mess as a result our brothers and sisters in saudi arabia and kuwait are facing extreme hardship swaraj said adding that while the situation in kuwait is manageable matters are much worse in saudi arabiaapart from these workers in alshumaisi camp officials said there were over indian workers detained in other camps im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme
india,not_removed,much respect hope this becomes the norm
india,not_removed,india is always cautious in taking a bold stance on the international stage and for good reason however i think we should take a bold stance against saudis on a variety of different issues including their treatment of foreign labor which are essentially treated like slaves the world is starting to the realize the shitfest that is saudi arabia and india should lead the charge
india,not_removed,fuck the saudis why do we put up with those neanderthals
india,not_removed,well its good and appreciated that the ministry is responsive to such incidents but i think the ministry needs to be more proactive than reactive ministrys policy should ensure and monitor such incidents dont happen why are jobless people kept there like animals or do they prefer to stay there what is ministry going to do other than short term measures
india,not_removed,they knowingly went to a sharia shithole i dont understand why the indian govt keeps rescuing these idiots why doesnt the govt charge a fee like from every person who goes to these sharia cuntries which will be returned with interest whenever they come back and forfeited if they need to be rescued
india,not_removed,also pls take care of those starving at home
india,not_removed,and we have lakh crore for bullet train priorities boss and there are many more starving within india
india,not_removed,im inclined towards believing this but i dont want to believe this because it makes me feel more uncomfortable so ill ask how does she know
india,not_removed,they made a choice to leave india and go to those shithole countries who gives a fuck
india,not_removed,i would rather the government feed the crore who dont have food and live right here in india
india,not_removed,no please dont we are too populated another reason to not populate you wouldnt need to go to hell holes likes the saudi
india,not_removed,can you give a source for starvation death figure the source you linked doesnt say where they picked up the figure from
india,not_removed,your source is bullshit
india,not_removed,she is minister of external affairs and she cant keep quiet just because people are starving here too its her duty to stand up for our people being oppressed overseas
india,not_removed,if indians starve in india its all good how did you come to this conclusion any source to backup this up there are indeed starvation and malnutrition deaths in india and there are ongoing efforts to remedy this but in such a large country as india identifying and reaching out to these people is a challenge the situation in saudi arabia is different indians are starving in saudi arabia because they have not been paid perhaps cheated since we can relatively easily identify those who are affected and reach out to them why shouldnt we help them
india,not_removed,i will say it again right to food guarantees food india is not in anymore our population doesnt have adequate nutrition level but mostly people do get food now
india,not_removed,you started complaining about downvotes in this thread as well can you wait for atleast an hour or two because now your comment stands at face downvotes like a man dude
india,not_removed,have you ever lived in saudi have you seen the conditions of these workers have you seen they way these workers have been treated in india they are at least free to do whatever they want
india,not_removed,their passports are with their employers
india,not_removed,probably they are modern day slaves with huge debt and passports in hands of official human traffickers
india,not_removed,because they dont want to i seen plenty of indian workers here they most prefer to live here than go back to india
india,not_removed,why are you blaming them people go to gulf usually to live a better life than they would here in india after reaching there many labourers are treated like animals how is that their fault not everyone has access to a computer and internet to do research before making such decisions many save up their entire life savings to go there try and look at things from their perspective as well besides india gets over inr in remittances httpsenwikipediaorgwikiremittancestoindia from saudi arabia yearly thats fifty thousand crore rupees they are an asset and not a liability and above all they are indian citizens which is why the government rescues them
india,not_removed,nobody sends slaves over they go by their own free will also animals breed indians are not animals
india,not_removed,this is a wrong way to think should we not build more roads until everyone is fed those who cant afford food should not be provided electricity until we can feed them right anything that helps a country towards growth is a good thing let that happen without ignoring the fact that there are people that need to be fed
india,not_removed,also boss those there unemployed could be put to work if that project goes through
india,not_removed,its the job of embassies to keep track of their citizens
india,not_removed,i dont want to believe this do you also not want to believe that crore indians starve everyday right here in india httpwwwbhookhcomhungerfactsphp
india,not_removed,so the government should just let them starve these people are citizens of india not exiles
india,not_removed,right to food guarantees food india is not in anymore our population doesnt have adequate nutrition level but mostly people do get food now
india,not_removed,youre missing the point people are starving in saudi not because of lack of resources but because theyre practically slave labours their passports are snatched away and they are not allowed to leave the country exit visa is a regressive policy
india,not_removed,yes let people suffer because of your overpopulation concerns idiotic population control measures should happen before the person is born after they are born you cant subject them to mistreatment because of overpopulation
india,not_removed,nris from saudi send around per year in remittances every year most people going there knows how hard it would be to survive in a country with abysmal human rights record but they still do it for the sake of their family this money not only helps their families but also contributes to our economy indirectly providing food and bringing them back home is the least we could do and our mea is doing a commendable job if you cant appreciate at least dont criticize them source httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiremittancestoindia
india,not_removed,hell holes d
india,not_removed,yes they do read the bibliography at the bottom
india,not_removed,the source gathered the information from the un though look at the bibliography at the bottom you should let the un know that their information might be incorrect
india,not_removed,i dont think the op is referring to sushma swaraj here its about india and indians in general if indians starving in saudi is news dying at home every day should be breaking news
india,not_removed,right to food guarantees food how is this right provisioned for instance if a person is starving where can she go to claim food
india,not_removed,not only do they not have their passports saudi also requires an exit visa
india,not_removed,do you need a bullet train or better roads
india,not_removed,railway budget lakh crore bullet train lakh crore from gujarat to delhi we know whats happening here
india,not_removed,but how
india,not_removed,your source is a random webpage if you want to be taken seriously give a credible primary source
india,not_removed,i already know this but finding out that things are worse than i know is never accompanied by a nice feeling
india,not_removed,no i would just rather that the crore starving in india get food before we start struggling to feed the indians abroad its all about priorities
india,not_removed,even the sources in the bibliography are from a decade ago
india,not_removed,point out to the particular sections
india,not_removed,not at all relevant to what uamodgil says he says thats a question for rajnath not sushma
india,not_removed,dying here everyday is a reality and government is working and actually pulling people out of poverty since decades but working indians living in subhuman conditions in foreign countries is a concern for her and it is refreshing to see our government is actually worried about our people overseas
india,not_removed,by using ration card and pds
india,not_removed,are they mutually exclusive if govt says that the money allocated towards roads will now be spent on bullet trains that would be wrong but if they have planned the budget to accommodate both then i dont see the issue
india,not_removed,umm well shes the external affairs minister so shell be tweeting about the indians abroad plus its a temp crisis unlike the situation here which is much complex
india,not_removed,i wonder where you got the crore starving figure
india,not_removed,is food via the pds system free
india,not_removed,alright thanks
india,not_removed,httpwwwbhookhcomhungerfactsphp theres also a bibliography at the bottom for more sources
india,not_removed,rupee rupee a kilo rice depends on states also
india,not_removed,adding a bibliography after your bullshit doesnt make it right either point to the exact report which can corroborate the figure or at least give a reputable secondary source not just a random webpage
india,not_removed,adding a bibliography after your bullshit doesnt make it right yes it does it shows that the statistics are from the un and not made up
india,not_removed,no it doesnt suppose i want to find where the crore starvation number or the daily deaths number come from the page says heres a list of reports where i got this number go read all of them to find whether what i said is true or not nobodys going to look all the sources to find one number it should at least point out which of the listed sources contain the relevant information few minutes of googling tells me the number is most probably about malnutrition rather than hunger malnutrition hunger you can eat from day till dusk and still be suffering from malnutrition not saying malnutrition is not bad but equating malnutrition and hunger is a useless exaggeration
india,not_removed,um no thats not how citations work what your link does fact fact fact sources source title source department name source program name what actual citations look like are shown below this is just one format based on the httpwwwchicagomanualofstyleorgtoolscitationguidehtml there are other valid formats which differ from discipline to discipline such as mla acm ieee apa etc fact fact fact fact footnotes author report name page numbers httpsenwikipediaorgwikiibid new page numbers if applicable link title date accessed url with relevant subsectionsubsection where possible such as with wikipedia links book namejournal name publish location year page numbers book name chapter number publish location page numbers sources author report name journal publisher location date link title date accessed main url book name publisher and so on for author i wasnt expecting detailed citations in your link but at the very least the specific citations ie page numbers have to be mentioned in the case of reports journals and books for specific data for example your link says hunger remains the cause of death in the world aids cancer etc follow then there are sources at the bottom how the fuck am i supposed to know which source says so so that link is completely unreliable you would have been better of saying you did original research and mentioning the reports directly instead of this useless link
india,not_removed,heres a list of reports where i got this number go read all of them to find whether what i said is true or not yes thats how most social research papers work a bibliography isnt there to prove whether the author is right or not its there to supplement the readers who want to go into more detail regarding the topic you can eat from day till dusk and still be suffering from malnutrition please tell me youre trolling
india,not_removed,the whole india needs to read the rfitness wiki so hard
india,not_removed,please tell me youre trolling im not trolling eat potato chips from day till dusk you will die of malnutrition if cholesterol doesnt kill you firstthe reason india has such a huge share of people suffering from malnutrition is not because they are not eating right amount of food but they are not eating the right kind of food the main source of protein in vegetarian indian diet are lintels and dairy products the poor cant afford both so their main diet consists of chapati potatoat least in the north the government has made ricewheat super cheap so people so starvation has stopped but a nutritious diet is still off plates for the poor
india,not_removed,cfr experts give their take on the cuttingedge issues emerging in asia today for me that gives us takeaway number one about usindia defense ties the time carter and his counterpart parrikar are investing in this venture illustrates the opportunity they perceive in a deepened strategic relationshipbut also underscores the hard timeconsuming work required to find a way for the defense systems in both countries to learn to work together more seamlessly carter developed his handshake metaphor for the usindia relationship more fully describing ties as two important handshakes the first handshake brings together the us rebalance to asia with indias act east policy to use the name of prime minister narendra modis asia strategy all of this gives us takeaway number two the emphasis on technology partnership is not just about cool new toys but about enhancing power toward the shared purpose of freedom of navigation and overflight and countering terror this brings me to takeaway number three as close as india is ready to come to the united states new delhi does not desire a military alliance that would tie it to us decisionmaking and military activities around the world im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme

india,not_removed,considering us indians hate any sort of community service without the prospect of future political advantage i am sure it will be a pretty good deterrent against crime most of us would prefer to get imprisoned rather than sweep the road
india,not_removed,this great idea will not work for long in india thr criminal justice system is corrupt to the core and community service will end up being a tick in the box for an amount of money and no service actually gets done
india,not_removed,clean as a firstworld nation u know i always used to think firstworld nations have a very high level of cleanliness then i moved to san francisco
india,not_removed,its a great idea but would you trust the supervisors
india,not_removed,great idea but wont work community service would mean decreasing fund supply to penitentiaries do you really see that happening with the level of corruption in incredible india a decreased budget would mean lighter pockets for everyone right from prison guards themselves all the way to the political highcommand such a thing will never be approved by legislature in first place and even if its approved it will not be implemented with diligence end result would be lessened control on criminals and lower accountability
india,not_removed,ooh i like this idea once someone is done picking km stretch of a area for say weeks next time they will think twice before littering
india,not_removed,implement this for drunk driving on top of fines
india,not_removed,whats wrong with sf
india,not_removed,corruption should not be used as an excuse for not getting things done corruption is the main reason why things dont get done i saw this thread couple of days ago where some were ranting for flipkart firing employees with poor performance the govt offices should do the same and when they do the offices will purged that is a step forward if you think making them clean litter will work then your so wrong our justice system wont even jail bollywood properly left alone create a body of governance to check whos littering and cleaning supposedly i am rich i get caught drunk driving and get job to clean this stretch of road what do i do a be honest and do it myself b hire some laborers and make them do it for me while i fatten the pockets of the supervisors
india,not_removed,labour is so cheap in india that the perpetrator may just employ someone to do it for them
india,not_removed,too many indians
india,not_removed,well not all of sf but certain areas are very dirty and ive come across poop on the sidewalks and actually seen people pissing in public and this is probably one of the richest areas in the world

india,not_removed,so the title should read as of urban indians not trained to carry out cpr
india,not_removed,chest compression in cpr follows the rhythm of the staying alive song dont know about the other one d
india,not_removed,daughter actually
india,not_removed,i have thanks
india,not_removed,wouldnt be surprised if they did completely stiff us im still in final year havent hit internship yet lets see
india,not_removed,do you have a certificate mbbs is trained in cpr but no certification
india,not_removed,final year and its almost over too nope they never made us but my school sucks in a million other ways and i have no idea what its like in other colleges here i was just sent here to do mbbs 😒
india,not_removed,im not at all confident about my abilities to perform it eezy just get one of those blow up dolls the best part is you can do more than just practice cpr with it ͡ ͜ʖ ͡°
india,not_removed,link to the video
india,not_removed,that would be against tradition and culture
india,not_removed,not really in honesty specially in india where there is less access to a defibrillator we are taught by movies that cpr will wake a person up this never will happen without a shock and even with cpr and then a defibrillator the recovery rate is in america id like to assume its much less in india
india,not_removed,oh i am sure it works wonders but statistically its a failure a study showed that only about of adults who collapse on the street and receive cpr recover fully
india,not_removed,for the desis main ladki po po po tu ladka po po po edit make that
india,not_removed,dont know about the other one same is the case with another one bites the dust around bpm
india,not_removed,stay quiet we never treated you differently from your brother you are always like a son to us
india,not_removed,i dont im not an mbbs but do mbbs docs need to have a certificate isnt their degree enough
india,not_removed,must be pvt college
india,not_removed,this guy fucks
india,not_removed,like
india,not_removed,found a video better than the one i saw
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,culture you cia agent its kulcha
india,not_removed,the average overall survival to hospital discharge from emstreated ohcaout of hospital cardiac arrest in england is this is significantly lower than for populations in other developed countries north holland norway regarding aeddefibs of all arrests generally only are in shockable rhythm but recovery rate is much higher in them speaking from personal experience patients coming in with cardiac arrest who got pre hospital cpr vs who didnt have an infinitesimally higher rate of survival im an ae doctor so yea even if the success rate is low its worth it success rates for in hospital cardiac arrests is much greater
india,not_removed,definrillators are only needed in three cardiac comditions only three and you need a maths lesson coz any number is infinitessimaly better than
india,not_removed,thats enough for a survey dont you think
india,not_removed,thats actually a very sufficient number even after considering the heterogeneity of population in india
india,not_removed,the rhythm is correct imo m ladki respiration po chest compression po chest compression po chest compression
india,not_removed,im genuinely surprised at this one
india,not_removed,cool til
india,not_removed,until it is marriage time when it makes a big suitcase difference
india,not_removed,certification isnt necessary to save lives all mbbs graduates are taught cpr as part of curriculum neither can be said that all who passout are fluent in cprpun intended everybody receives hands on practical training theoretical questions are asked in exams too a medical intern might be involved in performing cpr to revive patients on a tough duty at a govt hospital nor can be said that all patients get revived its basically a set of rituals that is to be performed in hopes of helping the patient live another day the revival rate does improve immensely if you have a good team of doctors nurses paramedics and attendantsfamilyfriends training and certification can also be obtained from various internationalhttpwwwredcrossgujaratorgfirstaidtraininghtml institutesprograms certification in httpwwwatlsin is considered resumé worthy
india,not_removed,dolls
india,not_removed,jared really fucks
india,not_removed,thats not a blow up doll you dummy
india,not_removed,thanks
india,not_removed,i could have added s but unfortunately like indians i figure will oppose a coed cpr or even a samesex cpr incredible india has separate schools classes and even partitions within classes for sexes and a cpr will simply be deemed as western conspiracy by wise elder folks plus most importantly you must first enquire caste before giving cpr you dalit no cpr for you
india,not_removed,atls is not cpr and whatever you said is what i wrote why would an mbbs need a certification
india,not_removed,oops got anne confused with a blow up doll
india,not_removed,youre saying that as if we actually value human lives see a lying man on the footpath and no one gives a flying fuck about him what makes you think cpr can change that we were also taught the theory of cpr but never a practical implementation
india,not_removed,resumé the same reason a sherpa would get a mountain certificate it just adds credibility if you say atls is not cpr you are not worth my time

india,not_removed,good work isro keep it up literally

india,not_removed,we give the most kilometerslitre just look at mangalyan p good on us
india,not_removed,so prod
india,not_removed,see this is exactly why you can never discount isros capabilities kudos to the scientists at isro
india,not_removed,isro has literally been kicking ass

india,not_removed,does anybody know how isros launch costs compare with spacex
india,not_removed,and rest of the world will never know it was india who helped to get their shit on the space
india,not_removed,children in africa could have also eaten the carbon emissions s
india,not_removed,bbc
india,not_removed,wish i was in bangalore
india,not_removed,isro has literally been kicking ass literally
india,not_removed,currently it is cheaper because spacex is not outbof design and development the other factor is that isro has vast experience and is backed by the government this means that in case of failures it cannot go bankrupt unlike a company people who want to launch very expensive satellites take this into account
india,not_removed,probably cheaper till spacex can manage to actually reuse their vehicles but i am just guessing
india,not_removed,search on quora some pretty good discussions on there damn you auto moderator anyway i paste what i wrote before except the quora part as of now a comparison cannot be made in short because spacex vehicles are designed for bigger payloads and isros for small for example the current operational launch vehicles for spacex is falcon to a higher orbit and for isro pslvxl to lower earth
india,not_removed,because us government tried to put sanctions on our satellite projects and now they are using them
india,not_removed,no it wont
india,not_removed,both are playing different games isro is relying on cheap labor to provide cost efficiency spacex on technology but these new deals are bringing in much required investments that isro needs since they are also building rockets which can compete with the spacexs
india,not_removed,fuckin kek indians actually believe this spacex is docking with the iss and planning on a mars trip india still cant put up a bloody communication satellite in orbit reliably without running to the europeans but sure buddy spacex is going to die
india,not_removed,never will spacex is way too ahead of the curve
india,not_removed,bbc big black cock
india,not_removed,yeah didnt you hear they lined up all the engineers and scientists from spacex nasa and esa and had their isro counterparts deliver each a swift kick on the ass
india,not_removed,fellow doesnt know definition of literally

india,not_removed,say what panjeet isro is planning a mars mission too and moon
india,not_removed,doesnt india already have a mars mission the cheapest one
india,not_removed,and north korea is planning to nuke usa wake mev up after it fucking happens
india,not_removed,spacex is yet to relaunch one of its returned first stage until then isro is the cheapest way to launch a satellite

india,not_removed,using a redmi prime for around months or so havent been disappointed yet the hardware is pretty good build quality is decent and i also love miui more than stock android the best part is i get all this for an ultra low price of couldnt have asked for more parents have been using xiaomi phones for about years also gave reported no issues been a satisfactory experience so far
india,not_removed,you get what you pay for buy xiaomi if you are on a very tight budget it is equal to or better than the competition in the price range but against the nexus line it pales the miui sucks if my experience with the mipad is anything to go by
india,not_removed,great phone shitty updates

india,not_removed,great phones fortunately havent visited the service center even once in last years
india,not_removed,phones exploding due to battery issues can and do happen occasionally with all phones even iphones personally i bought redmi phones when they came out and have been using it as the main phone for months now still happy with it no complaints from the rest who i bought for either i also have a which was my main phone till i damaged it due to my own mistake i am trying to get it fixed elsewhere since its out of warranty
india,not_removed,op i want to buy it too where did you buy it from
india,not_removed,xiaomi is a really good phone as another user here mentioned the fault maybe with the battery pack of the phone and i have seen many people who dont use the right chargers they use some cheap rupee charger and it can also cause damage to the phone or if they have swapped their battery for a higher powered battery that can also be harmful they dont see what harm small things can cause xiaomi as a phone is really good and just because phone went bad doesnt mean all phones are bad

india,not_removed,yesterday i submitted this story linked to the and it barely made it to the front page and yet a submission from dailyfail makes it shows clicks are much higher when the entire story can be crammed into a headline
india,not_removed,slight correction the story and the sting isnt to manufacture large scale hindumuslim riots as the headline and even the first few paragraphs suggest it is to violently protest against a moviedocumentary for publicity in exchange of money big difference its a well known practice and a small time actordirector raja bundela also got caught doing this few years back its disgusting but not shocking or some new revelation in media
india,not_removed,firs should be filed against guys like these not fucking tanmay bhat
india,not_removed,the undercover journalist travelled to muzaffarnagar the scene of tragic hindumuslim riots in to visit its bjp mla kapil dev agarwal in their first meeting the legislator lost no composure as he heard about the purportedly antihindu subject of the bogus documentary instead he sounded keen to know what was there for him to gain from it of course this is how you get promoted in bjp anyways sanjeev balyan and sangeet som got involved in riots and were awarded union minister posts this guy is thinking that he too needs to follow their footsteps as that is what the high command rewards meanwhile their friends in sp handle the muslm side of things they both feed off of each others polarization
india,not_removed,an alternative explanation is that these politicians are basically running a con they will take the money and do nothing what are you going to do ask for your money back this points to a wider problem reporters are interested in generating publicity to attract viewers they are not interested in actual criminal investigation and prosecutions ideally the reporters should have went to the relevant authorities to launch a proper investigation once sufficient evidence is collected the reporters can have an exclusive story in return for their help

india,not_removed,on randia you also have to factor in who posted the story and whether it shows an x political party in good light or not
india,not_removed,shows clicks are much higher when the entire story can be crammed into a headline yes unfortunately most people only vote based on the submission headline
india,not_removed,the story and the sting isnt to manufacture large scale hindumuslim riots as the headline and even the first few paragraphs suggest it is to violently protest against a moviedocumentary for publicity in exchange of money yes because the people involved in the former arent like the exact same ones involved in the latter
india,not_removed,it really doesnt take long to turn a peaceful protest into a riot given the right trigger alsoa lot of the same people who would show up for sloganeering will show up for riots i would chalk it up to poverty and the zealots who whip up religious frenzy

india,not_removed,can we kickstart a campaign to castrate and then slowly crucify them
india,not_removed,yeah an average middle class fresher with a job is never going to hire them is he
india,not_removed,no i didnt mean that they might be capable of even that idk but this story or sting isnt about that reading the headline i thought there is a machinerymercenaryarmy available on call to manufacture riots and killings on a large scale which isnt the case thankfully that is not as easy as pr for a movie
india,not_removed,holding up placards and shouting slogans are vastly different from killing people and gutting shops
india,not_removed,if we are doing body count the congress beats the bjpsptmc pretty much all other parties combined except maybe the maoists surat riots hyderabad riots bhagalpur riots nellie which has a direct cause in indiraji giving millions of bangladeshi illegals the vote have we had any detailed commissions or findings and arrests made after that nope the tiwari commission report has been and never even published the author japanese so no sanghi conspiracy here says that the blame is on the central govt of indiraji for imposing elections on a state at combustion point post which the blame is on the state congress again for watching by idly as the massacre took place after instigating the violence in the first place httpwwwcaravanmagazineinvantagethirtytwoyearslaternelliemassacreremainsallforgotten in the tiwari commission was set up to enquire into the matter and it submitted a report of its findings in may to the state government but the report was never tabled a few civil society organisations obtained copies of the report through the right to information act but for all practical purposes this document remains out the public consciousness to date now let us look at bhagalpur in a horrific riot in which more than a died the justice nn singh commission placed the blame yet again on the central govt rajivji state congress run you might want to read httpwwwdailypioneercomcolumnistscoffeebreakghostofthebhagalpurriotreturnstohauntcongresshtml one thousand workers belonging to the congress party were called to bahera an assembly constituency in darbhanga by maithili brahmins a snide reference to jagannath mishra and what was then the congresss core constituency in bihar and were asked to wear caps bearing slogans garv say kaho hum hinduhain and radhe shyam baba ki jai after a pause he added with a condescending flourish you try to understand the actual position in bhagalpur shiv chander jha who was the speaker was deadly against bhagwat jha azad another congress leader it was due to them and a few of their men that these riots interruptions they were behind these riots you might also want to read the production of hindumuslim violence in contemporary india by paul brass makes a good case for how both feed off riots and discontent either your memory is very short or decades of propoganda have blinded you either way you need to educate yourself now if you say congress bjp sp can be the best of allies all feed off riots and discontent with the bjp and sp having learnt what the masters of engineering riots and discontent the congress fairly quickly no disagreements there
india,not_removed,i dont know whether it is a con or not but that is certainly a reasonable possibility look at it this way someone asks you to organize a riot in return for money there are options that come to mind option report to police and receive no money option take the money and do nothing option take the money and really organize a riot which option would you pick option gives you the benefits with less risk it is not like someone will file a report about you not holding up your part of the deal after accepting the money
india,not_removed,you have absolutely zero understanding of what a leftwing party is when it economics most if not all parties in india are leftwing or left of centre when it comes to social issues bjp sp aimim etc are rightwing parties
india,not_removed,did you totally ignore the bjp guy in the video
india,not_removed,its just bullshit talkor did they actually announced a public bounty and it was taken care of
india,not_removed,im surprised there have not been any cases of vigilantism yet
india,not_removed,ya that comment was made in poor taste but still those idiots are ready to cause so much trouble for so less
india,not_removed,i have explained this earlier and will explain this one again riots which have state actors specially where they go ahead to seal cabinet berths are not the same as the ones where there are none there are certain parties who have unmatched records in the former and in fact have their whole rise dedicated to it accept that and move on also read up on zscore normalization
india,not_removed,probably it makes you wonder how bjp despite being a minor party in independent india managed to rack up so much body count also makes you wonder what would be the state of the country if rsshindu mahasabha fanatics seized power after independence
india,not_removed,aise kar gya india tarakki bhenchd
india,not_removed,there are always a lot of possibilities but there is nothing to suggest this is the case here
india,not_removed,well doesnt it happen around every major political arena retarded bjp goon announcing lakhs of money on kanhaiyas headbefore that it was some congi monkey announcing money on modis head in none of them ever even got a single frown from police court or their masters let alone punishment and this is a drop in the ocean
india,not_removed,indeed i wonder how indian population can put up with so many of these illiterate feral pigs that are our politicians revolutions have happened around the world for less
india,not_removed,lakh is a significant amount unless youre urban poor
india,not_removed,he is not disagreeing or agreeing with this all he is saying is that the headline story and the sting dont match up
india,not_removed,excellent line of argument get well soon
india,not_removed,where are the genociders and gang rapists in the above article i understand your lifelong vendetta over but where do you get off comparing every criminal you see to them
india,not_removed,and i have also explained this earlier and will say the same iots which have state actors specially where they go ahead to seal cabinet berths are not the same as the ones where there are none bhagalpur nellie gujarat rise of bhindranwale which was make no mistake total communal polarisation have had state actors from both central as well as state directly involved in it exonerating the congress from having any role in the or even of riots that have happened under its watch is just intellectual dishonesty while making any riot under the bjp as a state sponsored one is even more intellectual dishonesty if you could accept that the congress has engineered many more riots for their political gains it would be good even in more than local congress leaders have been implicated in leading mobs and instigating violence and this is not small fry people but we are talking sitting mlas and ex ministers edit the difference is the congress has a solid record of opening and then totally burying commissions from the shah commission on emergency to tiwari commission on nellie no trace of this record exists in public record and their media stooges will never talk about it thus burying the state complicity in engineering and running these riots
india,not_removed,i have explained this earlier and will explain this one again riots which have state actors specially where they go ahead to seal cabinet berths you mean like how kamal nath and jagdish tytler got cabinet berths in the upa government or how rahul gandhi personally campaigned for imran masood nonstate actors my ass ill explain this to you here and again youre a congress apologist using double standards to defend them with the lesser evil fallacy
india,not_removed,no party manufactures riots from thin air because riots require mobs of voluntary participants significant and popular discontent mixed with belief that culprit has been identified produces riots when it takes one person to tear a piece of paper out of a book in order to get muslims to burn down a bus and then hindus respond by burning own muslim place then the cause of the riot is rss member tearing pages out of a book and littering the street which is an utterly trivial act in any polite society considered worthy of a fine for littering and depending on the material rude and history culture development mindset everything else going on in society such rapid escalation has a culprit beyond any political party sometimes when one communitys beliefs differ enough and are strongly held enough then other communities will not be expect them to share common interests enough to coexist with mutual benefit when many hindus think of islam they look at the islamic world think of violent history of islam and see the compulsion to proselytize codified in islamic doctrine then they think if people have these beliefs in our society they are likely to try and turn india into a society we do not recognize like in pakistan or bangladesh where there are no hindus anymore and the more secular rightwing ones look at how abysmally backward muslim countries tend to be politically and culturally and economically and they think these beliefs dominate in most terrible countries its better to have hinduism if we must choose secular women look at muslim women who live in terror and petition government to ban triple talaq and similar muslim ideas and feel fear as well they do not believe society can share common ground with that community even if bjp stop existing tomorrow there would be violence perhaps even more because neighboring nuclear muslim theocracy pakistan might be emboldened and hindus would live under greater terror with the belief they have no political outlet at voting booth if bjp wanted to put the hurt on muslims they could easily cause mass incidents every day as it is being involved in a riot is a fraction of a fraction of a percentage of chance if youre one of the hundred million muslims of india if you want to solve violence you need to explain to hindu and secular why they see eye to eye with codified islamic doctrine they read about in terms of what society should look like in the longterm or you should wait until there is enough development that people have too much material wealth to risk loosing to violence like in europe today
india,not_removed,one of these days you may want to read about the riots that wracked hyderabad after it was retaken by the nizam and how the greatest icons of indian secularists nehru and patel knowingly allowed the hindus a week to vent their anger on the razakars and their supporters the rsshindu types were politically insignificant for the first few decades after independence because the holy congress had already appropriated that plank with their statewide cow slaughter bans countless small and big riots etc

india,not_removed,aapka id dekh ke makhan singh ki biryani arya nagar yaad aa gayi
india,not_removed,exonerating the congress from having any role in the or even of riots that have happened under its watch is just intellectual dishonesty huh i said there is a distinction between state sponsored and nonstate sponsored the epitome of dishonesty is clubbing these two while making any riot under the bjp as a state sponsored one is even more intellectual dishonesty i never did that but you are desperate to prove izzz equal too i think there have many riots under bjp government but i have not attributed it to bjp even in more than local congress leaders have been implicated in leading mobs and instigating violence and this is not small fry people but we are talking sitting mlas and ex ministers what do you mean by implicated
india,not_removed,what are you even on about did i deny that was not state sponsored this is the kind of eternal stupidity that people like you and your ilk post down here that is so damn nauseating youre a congress apologist using double standards to defend them with the lesser evil fallacy your have a moronic victim complex which will never go away do not worry we have our own programs to take such chutiyagiri to cleaners
india,not_removed,maybe just maybe next time read the argument and then try responding lest you come across as a bjp apologist
india,not_removed,i meant lakh per month
india,not_removed,
india,not_removed,huh i said there is a distinction between state sponsored and nonstate sponsored the epitome of dishonesty is clubbing these two implying the congress does not do the above is inherent in your statement unless i am understanding it wrong which is where the crux of my disagreement lies i never did that but you are desperate to prove izzz equal too i think there have many riots under bjp government but i have not attributed it to bjp again your statements constantly suggest that it is only one party that does the engineering state sponsoring unless i am reading it wrong what do you mean by implicated complicit found taking part inhowever you want it
india,not_removed,sir like ive said before youre one of the last people to be accusing others of bias here
india,not_removed,implying the congress does not do the above is inherent in your statement unless i am understanding it wrong which is where the crux of my disagreement lies i dont know how you got that bhagalpur and are clear cut examples implying the congress does not do the above is inherent in your statement unless i am understanding it wrong which is where the crux of my disagreement lies wrong interpretation complicit found taking part inhowever you want it tell me more about this who were these
india,not_removed,i have no disagreements in that case tell me more about this who were these
india,not_removed,you said they were found taking part in i would imagine that given the standards that we are setting here that statement should be corroborated by a court is there one if not this is a canonical example of intellectual dishonesty
india,not_removed,if that is the yardstick we are going by quite a few narratives which are based on he said she said would not exist also given the history congress has in burying their role in riots and other excesses i doubt a fair trial was ever conducted of the congress role in and never will be and oh if this is intellectual dishonesty as court verdicts are the guiding factor could we then agree that any statement implicating mr modi in the riots is also intellectually dishonest considering he was exonerated by the courts
india,not_removed,if that is the yardstick we are going by quite a few narratives which are based on he said she said would not exist wrong all my earlier opinions were based on this yard stick itself this is the reason by the same yardstick modi is given clean chit right also given the history congress has in burying their role in riots and other excesses i doubt a fair trial was ever conducted of the congress role in and never will be same for bjp this is the sole reason why the riots cases were moved out of gujarat it would be much better if you stopped saying congress congress congress yes i know that congress is the coming of satan but there is something about z´score normalization that you do not understand
india,not_removed,wrong all my earlier opinions were based on this yard stick itself this is the reason by the same yardstick modi is given clean chit right if that is the yardstick in which court verdict has the bjp been found guilty of state sponsored rioting pogroms same for bjp this is the sole reason why the riots cases were moved out of gujarat not even remotely the same in the case of the riots the case was moved out of the state as you mention for a decade you had a govt run by the congress one which made it clear that it would do everything in its power to find evidence to find modi complicit the case itself was conducted under an sit directly monitored by the sit in the case of congress run riots say nellie let alone court cases even commission reports were buried this is clearly evident in the amount and scale of arrests post and all other riots prior to esp ones that took place when the congress was in power at both centre and state nellie govt estimates put the number of killed at number of convictions zero if the hindu is to be believed not one person even went to trial bhagalpur in a riot which the then congress cm himself later said was instigated and spread by his detractors within the congress and a people died only were accused of which only have been convicted till date now compare this to guj which saw arrests a lot of these did get bail and some odd convictions in totality including famously of later cabinet ministers not even talking about or the earlier riots such as guj so no it is not even remotely the same the congress has a history and a track record of not conducting only sham investigations burying committee reports and issuing itself clean chits yes i know that congress is the coming of satan maybejust maybe you do but many others dont so consider this a free education service
india,not_removed,sometimes you have huge problems with context if that is the yardstick in which court verdict has the bjp been found guilty of state sponsored rioting pogroms maya kodnani forgot so early not even remotely the same like i said learn about zscore normalization you can not have it both ways
india,not_removed,they say free education is worth what you pay for it but this right here proves its worth less than that
india,not_removed,maya kodnani forgot so early i dont think you understand the meaning of a state sponsored pogrom like i said learn about zscore normalization you can not have it both ways non answer i just with numbers proved that congress engineered riots have never made it to the public limelight or judicial attention the way has which has lead the majority of this nation to believe that the congress is above engineering riots and instability
india,not_removed,sorry i dont follow
india,not_removed,i dont think you understand the meaning of a state sponsored pogrom i do non answer it is and like most words whataboutism victim complex this is an additional word that you do not understand i would recommend some reading in fact next time you do the same thing i will point it out to you and then youd know
india,not_removed,you dont because if you did you would not have made the maya kodnani comment to make a point about a state sponsored pogrom it is and like most words whataboutism victim complex this is an additional word that you do not understand i would recommend some reading in fact next time you do the same thing i will point it out to you and then youd know i could argue the same for you but let us degenerate into name calling you are entitled to believe whatever you want so feel free that said it is a non answer you said that it is the same bjp riotingcongress rioting when i have proved that it is not even remotely the same
india,not_removed,you dont because if you did you would not have made the maya kodnani comment to make a point about a state sponsored pogrom yeah yeah keep telling that to yourself i mean a convicted mla for riots went on to get a cabinet berth no state sponsor here guys fringe elements am i doing this right you said that it is the same bjp riotingcongress rioting when i have proved that it is not even remotely the same yes sir bjp beshtest this is the reason i do not get into hazaar word essay competitions with you if you had an iota of honesty you would have accepted some facts but no congress congress congress good bye
india,not_removed,yeah yeah keep telling that to yourself i mean a convicted mla for riots went on to get a cabinet berth no state sponsor here guys fringe elements am i doing this right i thought we were doing intellectual honesty and that only a court verdict is acceptable i love the latent hypocrisy here in one case you dismiss the congress politicians being involved because it wasnt said by a court of law here you do the opposite and make accusations not supported by any court of law you would have accepted some facts which would be if you had an iota of honesty likewise you would accept that the congress history of engineering riots cannot be matched but no congress congress congress good bye well the original premise that i was responding to was that it is only the bjpsp that engineer communal riots in up and by extension other places i was correcting that fallacy also dont get me wrong the bjp always follows the same template with one person abvp modi now talking vikas while a hardliner lka amit shah now doing the dirty work of temple politics or beef politics but pretty much every major player does it to the exact same effect as you can see it is not just congress congress congress however if people are blind to the horrific history of the inc when it comes to all things shitty i will correct them yes sir bjp beshtest at least justice got done even if the quantum of it is in dispute zero people even facing trial for a massacre in nelli just should tell any right minded person how effective the congress has been in burying even the worst crimes or bhagalpur for that matter where justice wasnt served for odd decades

india,not_removed,bro you are not alone i did face similar situation earlier in my life i worked for years for my fathers business and one day he kicked me out for some argue over some personal matter i had same situation as yours i wasnt allowed to work for the business whom i gave so many years and literally got nothing in return i waited for month to get things sorted from my family side but when i saw nothing is going to happen i tried to find a job but couldnt because i had a huge break in my life luckily a friend of mine was able to find a job in his office for me though it was not paying much but it was better than nothing i went there first day was good when i came back in the evening i thought i should tell my dad about this job so i told him that i have got a job his first question how much they are paying i said he repliedonly i said at least they are paying something my father was silent for around a minute then he said i can pay you if you want to join but you need do everything according to my instructions i didnt wanted to join but then i thought about the time i devoted to our business and seriously our business increased times since i joined so i agreed i learnt from my earlier mistakes and made sure that this time they just cant kick me out of business for some petty reasons all the clients were dealing with my dad even i used to transfer my clients to my dad since i was very happy with my joband i also didnt liked salesmarketing i was doing same things that you were doing planning execution purchase management earlier for which our parents can hire managers if we arent available i realize that things would have been different if i would have managed my own client base so from my new innings i used to deal personally with my new clients my client base kept on increasing and with in years i was providing of sales to my business right now i am in a situation where my parents cant kick me out of business actually they can but it would be their loss this time i can start a business of my own this time and they knew it very well so my reputation in my familyrelatives has increased a lot since then though i can take lpm lol out of my job but still dont take more than k per month as it is enough for me tldr ask your friends for any suitable job you can get once you are in you can show your potential to your bosses talk to your family after joiningthey may think you are not in position to negotiate if you tried to talk before going for any job i know its hard it was hard for me as well but since they are your parents they will think about you if you are in then try to take major responsibility this time

india,not_removed,indeed their recent fiasco over phony backdoors and forced updates of windows is pretty well known across europe and america microsoft customers in germany are considering legal actions against microsoft for forcing updates across their devices now after that how can our own government start partnering with microsoft for wretched skype plans i hope someone in our it ministry sees sense and advices the government about it
india,not_removed,thats very good now read section and also read on how a private entity is already using the data
india,not_removed,fair point ive edited my comment however s makes it mandatory to take consent and disclose the nature of use doesnt that make the whole exercise voluntary
india,not_removed,your question is answered in the article itself the question of whether consent was taken will arise only if the aadhar user is notified each time their data is accessed by someone which is not the case right now as per aadhaar act the uid authority is responsible for both maintaining the security and confidentiality of identity information and authentication records as well as for approaching a court in case of a security breach – which is a conflict of interest thus even a person whose information is collected and shared without their consent and knowledge cannot invoke the criminal penalty basically youll never know when your data is being leaked and misused and even if you do the investigation of that breach is supposed to be done by the same guys who leaked your data in the first place wonderful

india,not_removed,wasnt he selected by ignoring two seniors with better qualifications
india,not_removed,members of the army should be functionally tested on physical feats they have perform in the course of their daytoday duties ideally yes but this is very difficult to do in reality there are a thousand and one functions and coming up with fitness tests unique to each one of them would be wasteful plus personnel switch roles quite often so it would be best to get everyone to maintain minimum standards of fitness what sense does it make for those in charge of strategic command and whose job doesnt require agilityathleticism at all generals can and have been put in positions where they came under enemy fire paulus was a colonel general when he along with his army was trapped in stalingrad leslie mcnair was a fourstar general and was killed in a foxhole war is a very uncertain thing and it is always a good idea to take precautions
india,not_removed,no staff officers should also be fighting fit every soldier is first a soldier
india,not_removed,a fat guy is always going to perform worse than a fit guy
india,not_removed,after a certain rank havildar for soldiers and colonel for officers taking part in unit pt is not compulsory

india,not_removed,why the dislikes its obviously a joke
india,not_removed,no obesity is not right
india,not_removed,seniorsyesbetter qualificationsno
india,not_removed,those are good points and i might reconsider my opinion
india,not_removed,bmi is waay off we did something similar in the us military times a year our fitness level was tested set criteria based on gender and age if youre slow as fuck like i was i would do the swim for the cardio portion no joke even at peak fitness i am a tortoise on land i would ace the swim because i am part dolphin how fitting i joined the navy if our weight was over the max allowed for height we had measurements done on key areas of our bodies it helped get a better idea however you could have some swole bastards who still would not technically make the tape measurements either it still came down to the commander to decide if said person fails the fitness test fitness failures and youre out they roll off one at a time after years or so iirc
india,not_removed,after age of most males naturally put on weight around bellies its a natural process that can be fought with careful diet and high intensity exercise the army eats the same sort of unhealthy diet as average people curries floating on dalda
india,not_removed,if by fit you mean acceptable bmi and body composition then no not neccessarily he could be a heavy smoker or anaemic or a whole host of other things
india,not_removed,thats insane to me its not like the enemy cares
india,not_removed,doesnt want you to have useless muscle that you need to lug around for no reason they are looking for skeleton looking people

india,not_removed,clearly not fat enough
india,not_removed,was it needed
india,not_removed,no no no youre doing to all wrong youre supposed to attack me at this point how long have you been on this sub noob
india,not_removed,bmi and bodyfat together never lie bmi is perfect for of people bodyfat is perfect for of people together they make the best measurement there is also do you think you could train your running until you are fast if you never do it you cant get better at it
india,not_removed,what got you here on this sub genuinely curious also whats the longest you ever stood in an atm queue for cash soldier
india,not_removed,damn you now you ruined my mental image
india,not_removed,as long its not mousi
india,not_removed,per capita yes per unit mass no
india,not_removed,nope i am an excellent long distance runner i can still crush the run aspect of the fitness test but my score is much higher if i swim i am just slow as fuck even at peak fitness bmi is a good estimate but when your military career is coming down to an estimate its not adequate you need body fat measurement a lot of people just meet the height and weight requirement anyway but they dont want to fail people just because they have xyz going on
india,not_removed,husbeast is desi creep my reddit for deets america is pretty cashless anyway i dont need cash for of my transactions i lurk here for news about india you see all of our friends are desi for the most part and aside from a variety of languages being used in conversation when we socialize i like to not sound like a complete idiot when chatting i am sometimes the first to know india news because of this sub

india,not_removed,mark as old
india,not_removed,did anyone actually read it beyond the headline after independence the dominance of rich and powerful people in politics and rising inflation have worsened the countrys situation which is worse than what it was during the british rule bhagwat said after independence the dominance of rich and powerful people in politics and rising inflation have worsened the countrys situation which is worse than what it was during the british rule bhagwat said today there is an insistence on education in a foreign language english instead of education in the mother tongue as a result the importance of the foreign language has increased to a large extent in the country even years after independence india is being threatened by china and pakistan with rising concerns over internal security we should give top priority to military education to students to make india strong were the main points he was making and moreoverthis article is in fucking
india,not_removed,given rsss history of collaboration with the british mr bhagawat this doesnt surprise us at all
india,not_removed,antinational lagao ispe
india,not_removed,they named india as the jewel in the crown and looted a lot of wealth from india they caused a lot of pain to the majority of indian families poverty increased and the gap between rich and poor increased any indias strategic decisions were taken in britain and were for the benefit of britain they mistreated indians and started this self hatred that we still have for ourselves sure they built buildings and repaired roads but under their tenure the common man could not own a vehicle and most buildings were of use to the british only what is pitiable is not that there are people who are making such stupid comments on india but that the media actually selects these statements and highlights them across the general population the media controls the news show us good comments that indians are making and it will calm down the populace print only the stupidest comments as news and youll make the whole population more and more aggressive over the years
india,not_removed,its always new never gets old
india,not_removed,is it so what about the bengal famine made by winston churchill how the fuck english rule was any better how many gallons of gau mutra do you drink every morning
india,not_removed,that is reserved for people making fun of politicians
india,not_removed,how the fuck english rule was any better he was simply saying that our politicians were less corrupt beforeand they might be turning worse exploiters than the british what about the bengal famine made by winston churchill how the fuck english rule was any better wasnt many gallons of gau mutra do you drink every morning cut out the snide remarks til im an rss supporter
india,not_removed,he was simply saying that our politicians were less corrupt beforeand they might be turning worse exploiters than the british does it not imply that he meant that india was better off in the british rule cut out the snide remarks til im an rss supporter youre welcome hindutvaism runs deep in our social conditioning
india,not_removed,well only the set of exploiters have changed maybe stalin was right when he mocked our independence movement and if the magnitude is morethough the intentions of the british were far worse although his solutions miss the mark by a wide margin
india,not_removed,slow ass truck will fuck everyone behind him
india,not_removed,what about bullock carts man think of the tractor trolleys
india,not_removed,so in most of the cities in gujarat they have this bus service called brts they have a barricaded lane close to the divider with covered bus stops with a ticket counter built up on the divider any other vehicle that comes into this lane will either or will fined some amount say
india,not_removed,this was implemented or should i say piloted on some parts of the mount road in chennai there was lane for the buses lane for the cars and lane for the autos and two wheeler although it was partly successful it primarily failed because our people did not comply with the lane discipline especially the two wheeler and the autos i still think its a great idea also i liked your idea of clubbing the cars and autos into the same lane owing to similar dimensions of the two vehicles and we should try to implement it with stronger regulation to ensure compliance
india,not_removed,ive fantasized about this idea many times myself however the one big pitfall is we need to have proper roads first theres no point asking for lane discipline when youre driving on something just slightly better than mud
india,not_removed,a simple solution for traffic by famed youtuber cgpgrey
india,not_removed,it in interesting to know that an attempt was made again as you pointed out the discipline has to come from us
india,not_removed,true proper roads are required either way but the reason i thought this might work is because there is no other extra infrastructure needed than what already exists

india,not_removed,not offended by any of these you should be offended by our poverty statistics though
india,not_removed,lol you should stay away from internet or for that matter stay home you seem to be allergic to reality opinions which dont fit your world view
india,not_removed,lets not forget that modi was denied a visa to the us in for his alleged responsibility over the mass murder of muslims during the gujarat riots his nickname the butcher of gujarat comes from that event i dont see whats wrong in that its accurate that there was an alleged involvement by him
india,not_removed,shitty as it is banning free press sets a horrible precedent
india,not_removed,the hindu right bharatiya janata party bjp that drove the policy of normalisation the bjp with its instinctual antimuslim politics had long called for close relations with israel on the grounds that both the israelis and the bjp have an antipathy to muslims so you are saying bjp is not antimuslim mandir wahi banayenge anyone
india,not_removed,yeah ban freaking everything that offend your senses bc
india,not_removed,every single nongovt and noncommerce website should be banned in india we can never be too careful do you know how easy it is for anybody to create a webpage and say anything bad about india its ridiculously easy and we can never be sure when an innocent indian may get exposed to such filth we waste too many resources searching for such antinational websites and blocking them thats why a blanket ban will be the most sane solution

india,not_removed,calm your tits op its al fucking jazeera every single person who reads their stuff knows they have a heavy bias towards muslim victimhood and that they are basically a propaganda piece for qatar not to say that they dont publish good stuff thats nonpolitical the fact that they dont whine about qatars heavy involvement with the syrian shitshow but point fingers at the west for it speaks volumes about their bias you need to take everything they publish with a pinch of salt just like fox or dailymail
india,not_removed,what is wrong with what theyve said it is true that the butcher of gujarat is carrying out a strategic wipe out of kashmir is it wrong to speak the truth which goes against the oppressive hindu government

india,not_removed,i feel point is still relevant
india,not_removed,this is true universally except when it is about muslims wish people had the balls to call a spade a spade in this country

india,not_removed,but pakistan appears to have better results in influencing american senators and media outlets our external affairs ministy is just a joke just finding new ways to make us a laughing stock sushma swaraj spending time on twitter issuing passports other soft thingsand threatning some third party reseller on amazon
india,not_removed,true that and thank god our media isnt policed like in china
india,not_removed,alzazera is right wing of islam thats debatable aljazeera did pretty unbiased reporting during the iraq invasion much of the main stream media had a narrative which was more like western propaganda bush and his advisors were extremely disgruntled due to this they even considered bombing them httpsenwikipediaorgwikialjazeerabombingmemo
india,not_removed,op loops his yajñopavītam around his penis and he doesnt like the feeling of meat constantly touching it

india,not_removed,thats exactly what an antinational would say
india,not_removed,namo doormats how can you write such filth and still not be banned from the internet but you have a point there should be a blanket ban on every website and only the ones approved by sushma swaraj should be whitelisted
india,not_removed,how so most of the people of kashmir throw rocks and join militant groups to get away from us if that isnt a sign of rejection what is
india,not_removed,much of our own media is guilty of those things can we ban them first please
india,not_removed,exactly
india,not_removed,that is why we should be cautious every time such news comes up should check the realities on the ground whether the hype made is relevant whether vested interests with their own crooked agenda is at play one of palestinian i know was surprised when i told him india was one of the first countries in the world to recognize palestine as a state had an embassy at ramalla i told him this when he crimped palestinians cannot travel to any country in the world with their passports or something
india,not_removed,you forgot muslims worship a man who married a yr old kid people who worship a pedo should think twice before pointing fingers at others

india,not_removed,congress and these so called samajwadi lot has been misusing all minorities through vote bank politics i hope these minorities also open up their eyes and start voting for development centric forces
india,not_removed,brave new world so much shit floating around that you really cant figure out what is real and what isnt for every fact there is an unfact since everyone can say anything you could decide on anything and have shit to support it if people had infinite time computational power and information sure that could work
india,not_removed,blatant bjp bhakti yeah i remember when he came out in vocal support of the bjp during the beef ban debate i think puts it rather well whatever you may choose to call him and we can get as imaginative as we want arnab goswami was the closest we ever got to an independent pundit when people call him a bjp stooge they reveal their own bias if not their unbridled jealousy at his success for he has been an equal opportunities offender throughout these years and it is if you remember subramanium swamy who called him a dumbo and an ignoramus and the spokesperson of the bjp who accused him of taking money from the lobby and he has been subject to choice abuse by internet hindus and i know because i get mistaken on twitter for him when people call him a bill oreilly wannabe they forget perhaps because they dont know and they are using a name that makes them sound knowledgeable that bill oreillys main plank is social conservatism and his bread and butter is attack on judeochristian values and he rails and rants against the secular progressives who are ruining americas christian culture whereas arnab goswami has consistently been progressive on religious hindu issues—be it temple entry for women or being this independence i believe stemmed purely from arnab goswamis core beliefs—that there is only king and only one god himself
india,not_removed,who is yr ideal may b i shall follow him pl elaborate
india,not_removed,the bhakts have been completely sidelined nobody has been able to give these trolls their voice arknob can fill this void and allow most of them to advance their stage of mental illnesses if demo couldnt open their eyes to the despicable scam run in an autocratic manner nothing will if a bhakt can justify that of cash has been demonetized for the good of india then his mental illness cannot be cured arknob says that people with illnesses deserve a voice and a govt that is autocratic to the core which bans articles media internet at their will
india,not_removed,indeed there was an americans react video on youtube to arnab debate with subbu swamy this is how goswhinnys journalism is perceived in the west
india,not_removed,dont know what to say they do have more influence with usa than us probably because of cold war era hangover also there is an inconvenient truth lot of money and arms used get serviced between pak and usa selfish interest will be hardcore on those lines usa use them as a tool in multiple facets in world scene unlike ethical business we do so they tend to have better connection
india,not_removed,iraq war was an unjust war anyway obviously aljazeera will be the good guy here
india,not_removed,i even know the logistics why modi was denied visa biased media is biased dont like it get off my lawn
india,not_removed,count me in
india,not_removed,during independence the maharaja of kashmir chose india over pakistan this is well documented httpwwwjammukashmircomdocumentsinstrumentofaccessionhtml so the claim that we are occupying kashmir is wrong on the other hand pok is a territory occupied by pakistan which originally belongs to india most of the people of kashmir throw rocks this is a whole another story rockthrowing incidents happen in a few towns most of the valley is peaceful though while we are at it indian government policies are one of the reasons for rock throwing incidents and people joining militant groups the afspa introduced by the indian government has alienated the masses and has made them disgruntled most of the media is oblivious to it or choose to ignore it afspa has been very effective in curbing insurgency and terrorism but as there is no oversight it has been misused by a some i have just scratched the surface there is a lot more to this it does not mean the people of kashmir reject us stone throwing incidents are actions of a few and it does not represent the large groups who live in the valley peacefully
india,not_removed,all religion have moral flaws especially the islam i can rant on any religion including pacifist ones like jainism
india,not_removed,meena kandasamy is a badass ref
india,not_removed,if being a badass means a condescending bitch who needlessly targeted a religion then yes shes a badass
india,not_removed,has a nice one too have jogged beside her
india,not_removed,i am sure there is a middle ground between brave new world and nineteen eighty four
india,not_removed,in brave new world books literature cinema and media are obsolete in fact the protagonist awakening comes when he reads shakespeare in a indian reservation
india,not_removed,so a broken clock is still right twice a day its still broken i can pick another example to show his bias surgical strikes any participants were shouted down insulted for questioning the narrative how dare you insult the army get out anothermodiji appears to prefer to give interviews to arnab only maybe due the extreme grovelling almost in awe kind of feeble questions he asked he could have asked the tough questions but went for the easy sound bites bias part aside he is still a bad journalist and inability to present nuanced arguments appealing to the lowest common denominator is no measure of success but i am hoping republic tv he does not have to toe the line as an employee anymore and brings something more fresh
india,not_removed,any personchannel who can present the news in a balanced way nuanced fact based arguments example bbc its not perfect but is highly regarded for in depth and balanced views
india,not_removed,a bunch of professional youtubers from the western world are the jury now
india,not_removed,they did not have to stand up they could have chosen an easier route like other media outlets the fact that they stood up is a good thing
india,not_removed,if its about maut ka saudagar it was in relation to shahabuddin case rather than the riots
india,not_removed,here come to your god
india,not_removed,the maharaja wasnt a elected authority who knows what the people wanted since no consideration is taken from them afspa is a major source of antagonism between the people and the government but as to whether the majority are peaceful and wish to remain or not remains undetermined as no one has ever really conducted a survey as far as i know
india,not_removed,badass firebrand courageous merciless exhibit a exhibit b screwtiny by meena kandasamy for an affair trust any man who is allergic to children carries a civil war in his eyes travels a lot and speaks up when you are subjected to societys customary stonethrowing this hero has a history of scandals he keeps secrets like slavegirls trust this man to never let you down or stand you up even if it involves rising from the dead amen for marriage trust a man only after you have dunked his head in buckets of freezing water trust all the truth spilling out of him when you have slipped like soap on skin rusty pins under his toenails eyes wide open trust him as you take him on an electric dance that makes his penis sing test him to trust him detest him to trust him trust a man through faith in all forms of torture which is how men trust each other from ms militancy page navayana delhi exhibit c those who advocate such a demoralising of society have no tolerance to declass and decaste it such a reiteration and celebration of womens sexual freedom is an absolutely apolitical project the nude woman in a corporate advertisement may appear to be the strongest one you have ever seen but she is not going to step out of that page and smash the shackles of sexual oppression perhaps she cannot speak at all not even to save herself it is merely a corporate appropriation of the feminist notion of freedom that does not envisage any social change sex and the city and its many clones may be about lusty and liberated women but they do not have a single care about the rest of the world as a poet writing extensively about the politics of the body i dont grudge the carnivalisation of the carnal i dont have a shred of belief in amorphous identities like indian culture that allegedly come under threat everyday i understand that writing about sex itself becomes a weapon when one has to combat castehindu patriarchy corporations cannot lay claim to the same freedom of expression and creativity that a writer needs an artist can at best make a statement capitalism on the other hand conditions because of the political responsibility that comes from writing i oppose the capitalist heteronormative hedonism that flaunts openly exploitative relationships and causes the elite to believe that they are entitled to enjoyment in my opinion global corporates resemble the merciless caste structure enshrined in hinduism which is why it is a scary option in india today one cannot forget that there are casteistfeudal remnants among the urban elite it may be the reason why sexual conquests are seen as a matter of pride and position if one realises that we belong to a caste society that once demanded that untouchable women bare their breasts and not wear blouses well move closer to understanding the male gaze that predominates advertising today
india,not_removed,we are living in it p
india,not_removed,republic tv also has right wing investors iirc
india,not_removed,i can pick another example to show his bias surgical strikes any participants were shouted down insulted for questioning the narrative how dare you insult the army get out yes arnab is an asshole and a terrible journalist and he positions himself as a nationalist i dont think anyone here disagrees but thats not blatant bjp bhakti by any stretch of imagination remember this was the same arnab that muted meenakshi lehkis mike when he didnt like what she had to say presstitutes was a term that gen vk singh coined for drumroll arnab so much for him being in cahoots with the bjp modiji appears to prefer to give interviews to arnab only you know what they say appearances are deceptive modi has given interviews to rajat sharma india tv smita prakash ani rahul joshi network and david letterman in recent times the first two before the general elections it was in fact rahul gandhi who gave an exclusive interview to arnab and arnab alone before the may elections
india,not_removed,but theyre white
india,not_removed,lol do you even understand what perception means
india,not_removed,i would prefer a godess whom we can all worship with tongue
india,not_removed,before independence all of the maharajas were not elected authorities the princely states had a maharaja who would make decisions on behalf of their people thats how things worked back then the same process was applied to other princely states like hyderabad junagadh mysore etc who knows what the people wanted since no consideration is taken from them the same argument can be applied to all the citizens during partition but it does not change a thing as to whether the majority are peaceful and wish to remain or not remains undetermined as no one has ever really conducted a survey as far as i know you have a valid point here i wish we could have a solution to this issue regardless there is no denying the fact that kashmir is an integral part of india the state of jk was accepted into india by legal means not by force coercion occupation etc so the claims by pakistan and separatists regarding the region has no validity
india,not_removed,pretty she is too

india,not_removed,what we need is more transparency in the judicial system every commoner like you and me needs to be aware of the judicial process and how the courts disburse justice unless they know that people are watching they are not going to work sincerely there used to be a website called groklaw in the usa where legal professionals across all court circuits used to update the common public unfortunately the service was stopped due to some technical issues such a thing like groklaw can really do well in india
india,not_removed,agreed govt needs to invest and innovate more in police and judiciary
india,not_removed,what is ais
india,not_removed,govt had a good chance with njac but they went overboard and gave the sc a reason to invalidate it

india,not_removed,higher judiciary is not above government its equal and cant face interference from it this is a district court you are conflating two seperate entities
india,not_removed,unfortunately thatll never materialise at least not easily the sc will vehemently shut down any attempt at a judicial overhaul and complain about interference its a systematic circlejerk thatll be very hard to break

india,not_removed,the sc outlawing entire acts means the higher judiciary is above the elected representatives of the people
india,not_removed,indeed it wont happen so easily but if enough of us got dedicated for this and start a movement like lokpal movement had happened in by anna hazare it is surely possible
india,not_removed,so you want to reduce corruption by copying iasthe most corrupt thing in the countryliterally the scum
india,not_removed,sc outlawed it because it violated the constitution why did it violate the consitution because it would result in politicians appointing judges and constitution says judiciary should be independent of the government there are three organs executive legislature and judiciary all three are independent have specific functions within the constitution and have been made to keep a check on each other if judiciary comes under government control then its violating the constitution look at adm jabalpur and see what happens when politicians appoint judges
india,not_removed,bullshit politicians were not appointing judges a panel consisting of the cji two senior sc judges the union law minister and two other persons nominated by the pm cji and the leader of opposition if you look carefully of the panel is the judiciary and the nomination of the two persons of eminence has both the leader of opposition and the cji involved the balance of power was maintained and lastly no institution in a democracy should be run without any kind of representation from the people you should know as of now the unelected are nominated among their own coterie promoted among their own coterie and become sc judges from among their own coterie it is the tyranny of the unelected
india,not_removed,the majority was in the favor of the politician considering the eminient persons were to be appointed by the cji pm and leader of opposition so effectively the pm and loo could collude to nominate puppets to control the sc i agree with your last point however the njac as the govt proposed was not the ideal solution there is a way to ensure accountability and transparency without making judiciary less independent i would recommend you read up on adm jabalpur and what happens when judiciary becomes subservient to the government
india,not_removed,i supported demonetisation at first my patriotism made me change my mind we bribe avoid taxes peddle influence abuse power litter streets break the law disrespect women and scorn at the poor the true measure of patriotism is not crying hoarse against pakistan or shouting bharat mata ki jai the loudest or even supporting the government in everything it does i see the absence of planning and foresight the lack of vision and direction the ignorance of economic realities and mathematical calibrations what was supposed to be planned to the t and executed to perfection has been lost to the shock and awe strategy post the optics of the surgical strikes this is about talking for the voiceless powerless people who stand in queues suffer in silence wash their sorrows and are still more patriotic than the rest of us here are some other news itemscredits to im a bot op can reply with delete to remove httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetosallurocks did i just break see how you can help visit the source and check out the readme

india,not_removed,why dont we just accumulate the dead every year and just launch it into space along with the odd launches isro does every year directly shot to heaven
india,not_removed,there was a ted talk where this woman created some burial suit with mushroom spores which would exponentially speed up the decomposition how bout that we shouldnt burn bodies and pollute the air and the rivers
india,not_removed,we will never find answers if we keep digging around dualities
india,not_removed,yes
india,not_removed,yep at least in the christian cemetary near my house
india,not_removed,it takes more than years for a body to fully decompose into earth not to mention the box the body is buried in
india,not_removed,theres your startup idea son
india,not_removed,that is a thing yes
india,not_removed,creative thinking
india,not_removed,not required in places where their is a shortage of land burial spots reused after five years
india,not_removed,is it a burial then if you are above the ground then why follow the rituals at all
india,not_removed,getting nailed will take on a totally new meaning
india,not_removed,theres enough space to bury crore muslims since they are not going to die together we dont know if sakshi ji his fringe bridge brigade have such plans
india,not_removed,they are not going to die together modiji called from to say challenge accepted
india,not_removed,since they are not going to die together that depends whos the ruling party
india,not_removed,since they are not going to die together the trust you put in dear leader
india,not_removed,they are not going to die together not if sakshi maharaj or his party have any say in it
india,not_removed,can it be done i mean reusing land i thought a single piece of land is reserved for a single person
india,not_removed,well it does
india,not_removed,you have just given me a business idea which can be explored
india,not_removed,no because law kabristans are not on government land they are on waqf property public trust and even then government acquires this land when needed metro acquired waqf land in delhi many years back the saket sports complex built by dda delhi acquired land from a kabristans
india,not_removed,just following the dear leaders lead
india,not_removed,why are muslims obsessed with fertilising the soil wait a minute thats not so bad
india,not_removed,i know you are joking but imagine the amount of energy wasted in raising the dead to that height and presumably put into orbit or imagine corpses raining down on random parts of the world
india,not_removed,muslims are not buried in boxes nbsp and burial grounds have existed for centuries pretty sure most of those bodies must have decomposed by now
india,not_removed,this is how kerala christians are reusing the burial land this bjp mp spewing pure venomhe is just doing this to piss of another religion wonder why these guys cant be booked for spoiling peace in the country
india,not_removed,it takes more than years for a body to fully decompose into earth why is this a problem is bjp planning to go back to its old ways again
india,not_removed,httpsnpredditcomrjesuschristreddit
india,not_removed,dark man too dark
india,not_removed,obviously it is being done did you really think that all the muslims who died for all these centuries have their own lands
india,not_removed,you are not supposed to make pakka graves it should not have tombstones or anyother concrete type material over it
india,not_removed,of course its done at least in the christian cemetary near my house
india,not_removed,saar violence is not the answer but i can see some times how some one can bring godhra
india,not_removed,bhai aap ye s bhul gaye
india,not_removed,indeed all that kinetic energy lost to entropy s
india,not_removed,let me know if you want an app for that
india,not_removed,this idea has existed for many years lol
india,not_removed,yeah acquiring waqf land in up is a big no it rarely happens under sp i know because im from there
india,not_removed,not true burials would poison the land only weeds grow on burial grounds on a positive note it doesnt really matter much because there are many lands where nothing is grown we can just use those lands as burial grounds
india,not_removed,do you even know the amount of toxic shit the human body accumulates over years due to bioaccumulation
india,not_removed,nah man we will be launching some french satellite of half a million tonne into the orbit just sneak another couple of million kgs of bodies tell the french that it is gas chamber or something i mean eventually in about they might figure out what we have been doing behind their backs and we will just outright deny any charges
india,not_removed,they actually can its called defamation
india,not_removed,atleast people die in a community of say muslims per year if an acre is allocated for burial i dont think there would be space for burial after years
india,not_removed,yes because acquiring any temple or church land is such a piece of cake amirite every city in up has an unnecessarily complicated junction or road which is stuck with traffic because the friendly neighborhood hanuman temple decided to encroach stop pretending like this is a muslimhindu thing
india,not_removed,it happens all the time when needed of course its not easy but when is it easy to aquire any land from the people in india especially when religion is involved would it be easy to remove a temple to build a road usually roads are built around mosquesdargahtemples archeological survey of india also acquires land and property like taj mahal is waqf but under asi control and rightly so my father worked on modernising waqf boards and presented a whitepaper on them to jpc he had suggested turning them into waqf development corporation with ceo and reducing the number of babus involved
india,not_removed,large number of waqf properties all over the country have been encroached or illegally occupied it is not well managed at all though some states have done better than others in bringing professionalism into it instead of few men doing what they want in most cases it is usually the local mafia encroaching upon the land or some board members selling off the land for their own profit ambanis building was also built on waqf land and there were irregularities in the deal
india,not_removed,of course i know it is common knowledge isnt it i mean who doesnt know this any person with basic education would know this or anyone who spent atleast in front of tv would know this i am shocked that you even have to ask this question preposterous
india,not_removed,how much
india,not_removed,article of ipc
india,not_removed,sigh acre sq mt assuming plot which is very generous per body you can burry people and have room to spare at deathsyear itll be years before they need to overlay sencond round of dead on the first at least do the simple arithmetics before posting numbers you pull out of your hat
india,not_removed,usually roads are built around mosquesdargahtemples wali gujarati begs to differ but then those were not the usual times and then again neither are these the usual times we have the same king that gujarat had then
india,not_removed,fertilising the soil should have said poisoning the soil and the water below
india,not_removed,usually burning is a good way of disposing of the dead because the probability of diseases being spread is low when compared to burial
india,not_removed,bhai i have seen people bulding stone things over bodies for memorial its not possible to put in other bodies over there burning is more efficient and not to mention best way to give nutrients in us back to earth says neil d tyson
india,not_removed,i would suggest not using this argument if you dont live in x then fuck off unless you really dont have anything else to hold your point up against maybe you could say it for a smaller scale region division like locality but for something as massive and diverse and up its a little silly and makes you look like youre clutching at straws which im sure youre not
india,not_removed,triggered hindutva apologist
india,not_removed,citation required were not talking about dead people piling on the streets during a plague or war
india,not_removed,usually burning is a good way of disposing of the dead because the probability of the deceased coming back is lower when compared to burial ftfy
india,not_removed,burning is more efficient and not to mention best way to give nutrients in us back to earth nope burrying without any stone things or markings which are only a minority of burrials still beats burning on that count which wastes electricity or wood and adds and other pollutants to air do you not know that delhis smog would go down considerably if only the farmers in neighbouring stes stopped burning the left over plant matter and benefit their own farms by composting it i would be interested in seeing the tyson quote in its context so a reference will be appreciated
india,not_removed,i dont need to explain myself to a random redditor take it or leave it the guys just accused me of riling up religion sentiments i dont take kindly to such accusations
india,not_removed,it is very miniscule in case of pollution come up with better argument
india,not_removed,burning is more efficient and not to mention best way to give nutrients in us back to earth nope you need to come up with a better argument for saying that a polluting way was better than other ways
india,not_removed,burning wood is generally way less like times less polluting than burning fosil fuels all the carbon is left as coal after wood burns down ever heard of electric cremation
india,not_removed,burning wood is generally way less like times less polluting than burning fosil fuels nah wood and coal are both practically all carbon so they are the same all the carbon is left as coal after wood burns down ever heard of electric cremation carbon burns c goes up being a gas and since most wood is just carbon there is very little left by weight there is practically no carbon left after burning wood if there was you could burn it wood ash is other compounds wiki says calcium carbonate calcium oxide iron oxide etc you could make ash bricks with it but as a source of nutrition for microrganisms its dead short answer to help you think burning gasessolid ash residue buryingsolid decomposed residue
india,not_removed,burning wood is generally way less like times less polluting than burning fosil fuels consider particulate pollutants and then provide citations youre digging a deeper and deeper hole for yourself all the carbon is left as coal after wood burns down this is at the scientific level of gobar power vimana going to mars please consult a grader before posting further inanities ever heard of electric cremation where does the electricity come from perchance from all the carbon left as coal after wood burns down

india,not_removed,exactly the ministers point
india,not_removed,holy shit i hope its a new season and not a reunion type episode
india,not_removed,i so hope its a new season shows like tarak mehta will go off air xd
india,not_removed,oh no ab dushant aayega 😂
india,not_removed,damn everyone looks older
india,not_removed,made me tear up a little one of the defining shows of my childhood
india,not_removed,new season yayyy this has been one of the best and most underrated shows on indian television modern family reminds me of sarabhai
india,not_removed,did monisha get hot
india,not_removed,great now bhuvan bam has more material to get jokes from
india,not_removed,i think its just a special appearance for jds new show on sab tvkhidki or something its called dont get excited guys
india,not_removed,fyi the original series is up on hotstar for free viewing seasons episodes clips
india,not_removed,people with lpm salary will finally get their own show back
india,not_removed,wow freddie
india,not_removed,yayyyyaayyyyaaaayyyy
india,not_removed,they should really cut down on the sound effects this time
india,not_removed,whoopi
india,not_removed,meh i never really got this show kinda liked older shows wagle ki duniya or shrimaan shrimati more the characters who seemed way too rich to me and hence i never related to it good for the fans i guess
india,not_removed,perfect
india,not_removed,finally they have been teasing this for so much time now
india,not_removed,they are making a movie calling it now
india,not_removed,oh damn fuck yeah used to love when it aired i think on star one
india,not_removed,imagine if netflix has commissioned a new season they have done it for full house gilmore girls and arrested development this wouldnt exactly be unprecedented
india,not_removed,i am not sure if the show would gain popularity this time around i think that genre of comedy will no longer be appreciated
india,not_removed,yeah hopefully nothing like the friends reunion episode that was a total disappointment
india,not_removed,like it or not tarak mehta is a cult show its not going away anywhere
india,not_removed,yea one of the shittiest shows with santoshi ki maa ki
india,not_removed,tarak mehta is consistently in top shows of india and that too with almost episodes i dont think it sub tv can take risk of removing their flagship show if trp doesnt go lower however you cant predict easily because rating are changed every week if producer or actors ask more money sub tv can cancel the deal also
india,not_removed,hain
india,not_removed,let me explain
india,not_removed,no shit sherlock its only been twelve years since the show started
india,not_removed,except roshesh
india,not_removed,without the gays empowered women and immigrants amirite

india,not_removed,tbh the netflix season of arrested development wasnt as good as the older ones
india,not_removed,not going to happen no producer would let neflix india have exclusive rights to their showbecause then the audience will be cut to a very small size and there is also a big problem of piracy because webrips are easy to make
india,not_removed,भाई तेरे मुंह में घी शक्कर
india,not_removed,low popularity good sarabhai is times better than anything comedic on tv right now

india,not_removed,i was just making an observation and didnt expect them to look this old sorry for rustling your jimmies
india,not_removed,rosesh vampire
india,not_removed,i would say the show had empowered women maya and in some ways monisha were empowered women
india,not_removed,hotstar isnt that bad is it adblock works on hotstar so i dont see a problem with that site its free viewing i just hate one thing on hotstar you cant middle click links to open in a new tab

india,not_removed,no producer would let neflix india have exclusive rights to their show global licensing pays a lot
india,not_removed,डायबीटीज़ से मारने का इरादा है

india,not_removed,my jimmies are doing just fine i feel old now
india,not_removed,well to be fair i havent used it in like months but at least back then it was shitty the quality was potatop and it still buffered every seconds and sometimes the audio wasnt synced properly i have a decent plan that shouldnt be happening i was watching sarabhai vs sarabhai on it then stopped because it became an abusive relationship lol you cant middle click links to open in a new tab yeah whats with that
india,not_removed,i have a few ahem episodes around on my laptop i watch them whenever i am bored of all the nonsense around me
india,not_removed,i wonder how the french italians or canadians would react when they heard khatarkhun khatarkhun khatarkhun
india,not_removed,lol dont be so cynical just because low iq dumb movies and shows make it to the top in cinema and tv industry it doesnt mean there is no one craving for good content too
india,not_removed,when do they show cid now i miss that show
india,not_removed,im subscribed to hotstar premium cause they have all hbo shows the same day as it airs plus the whole hbo catalogue which is superb the viewing quality is flawless ui could do improving

india,not_removed,i own a nexus which was supposed to be top of its class when it was released except the indian version doesnt have volte this shit really hurts my ability to use jio i like to stay on mobile data since i use google maps a lot and recharging on prepaid every time for small packs in annoying on airtel id love it if jio had a option to call without volte especially since their aim should be to grow their market beyond only phones or my phones companies google and huawei have to give in but they say its a hardware defect and nothing can fix it right now i hate having to sit on lte just to receive or make calls i know its not their fault but a option would be nice to have especially with the growing customer base was really hoping for a positive change on volte from either google or jio but guess i have to wait longer
india,not_removed,this is what a true game changer looks gb for is phenomenal i just hope the speed witnesses a healthy spike right now its far from satisfactory for me
india,not_removed,i am still waiting for the confirmation on per day for thats fucking awesome hate to have to call via jio apps though also you wont get calls or sms if you dont have that app active wtf the only reason i still have my idea sim
