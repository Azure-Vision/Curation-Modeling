jailbreak,removed,downvote me so hard plz
jailbreak,removed,so do it and stop bitching to me about it
jailbreak,removed,exact same question is posted times a day your situation is no different if you are not running and dont have blobs you cannot do anything apple started requiring signature verification for firmwares in like or something its the same fucking question and the same fucking answer that has been given on this sub times and you already know the answer to your question you cannot act like you had nooooo idea that you couldnt install anything but right now you know it i know it why bother with these stupid posts to make yourself seen for whatever reason attention
jailbreak,removed,try appadict get ipa from their website or try older version of appcake
jailbreak,removed,try installous
jailbreak,removed,come on sarah join in jerk the reason myself ucoolstar ucaughtinflux and most other developers are all unsubscribed is because of circle jerks like you have a merry christmas enjoy the internet points you gain and take from helpful people go jump enjoy being the stupidest person who pretends to know shit rjailbreak she is your help no developers will post here because of no it all idiots like usarahb enjoy your christmas 😆 lol u
jailbreak,removed,i get down voted for my hostility towards idiots like you kinda like what you claim to be doing for your karma however your issue is you get down voted because youre an incompetent prick yes there are people on here who get annoying deal and stop bitching about it because youre one of them now politely stop fucking whining
jailbreak,removed,you need it not more you can take this iconsupportdeb and than you can install anchor etc from cydia
jailbreak,removed,i dont need help i at one point taught development under a different handle actual objectivec im well aware of the community but youre being an ostentatious prick and its rather annoying
jailbreak,removed,deal with what sort of thing dont you see how ridiculous it is to commit fraud to receive a new phone just for the software version by your logic we should just fraud every company which has enough money sorry but some people on here are entitled pricks
jailbreak,removed,im not caring about the amount of karma its just if my comment is down voted it means it must be wrong if its mass down voted it gets hidden i have seen too many of my comments get mass down voted by circle jerks i have made a couple of posts that this has happened to as well then i see some jerks post about how lucky their mother was to get an iphone on hit the front page hey its just wrong and deep down you know that
jailbreak,removed,if you could be down voted you would know how much trouble it causes having the correct response hidden because someone doesnt like it having a helpful post about who to follow on twitter watching rjailbreak to find the next jb get down voted to the bottom of the sub you jerks dont know cause it cant happen to you
jailbreak,removed,appsync works
jailbreak,removed,yes thats a bug keep clicking in a slightly pulling to the left its been brought up several times in here thanks for being a smart ass cunt tho
jailbreak,removed,youve been a redditor for one hour and i just read your name you clearly are autistic and your family must not give you enough attention ill pray for you happy holidays
jailbreak,removed,how about you search and use the brain if its that hard to do how do you remember to breath
jailbreak,removed,as part of contributing i could offer you from web hosting vps windows or linux up to you as well as i could create those servers for you either in the us europe or asia depending on your needs ill happily as well maintain those servers for you and im a c dev it would be really nice if you responded back with your opinion and sorry if my english is not structured correctly it isnt my main language anyway
jailbreak,removed,wait wait coc is actually still vulnerable to iapfreecrackerwhatever holy shit get your shit together
jailbreak,removed,fake fake fakeeeeee fuck off
jailbreak,removed,oh god you again
jailbreak,removed,the intelligence of the jailbreak community is similar to the intelligence of the xda community and that goes to the developers too because social intelligence is also intelligence
jailbreak,removed,i think everyone did something like this in their live i didnt install this jailbreak because im experienced already but sure i did install some viruses on my computer many times as a kid because i wanted cracked games and free music etc and this is the same
jailbreak,removed,can you please make the ipa with this icon tt i dont have mac
jailbreak,removed,hey kid why did you delete this first thank you for fucking insulting me anyway i did put the device into aeroplane mode before it started and i did do my research and have you seen the user names on reddit people have crazy shit as their username so grow up and get the fuck off of reddit you old how did it feel being a stupid bitch you put your phone into airplane mode while running cydia impactor xd that is so fucking stupid hahahah xd how did it feel trolling yourself stupid bitch
jailbreak,removed,i assume theres a bug in ios cause two of my friends also had this i guess thats the photos from the app whatsapp my friend on had this exact issue all the photos from whatsapp were saved in the dcim folder although he disabled auto save and he had to delete all the dcim folders another friend of mine on has a similar issue that the whatsapp folder was taking up of data in the application support folder although he cleaned all his chats and groups deleting this folder caused all of his chats to delete tldr probably a bug in ios cause it didnt happen to me at if you want to temporarily fix it use a software like tongbu great software very recommended to backup your photos it will detect the camera roll ones youll backup them up them delete the dcim folders and then recover them to the camera roll with tongbu
jailbreak,removed,i like how everyone is calm and giving me advice on what do to except he is an asshole
jailbreak,removed,fuck you pangu
jailbreak,removed,i found a fix using ifile disclaimeri didnt find this myself all credit goes ifile i got a cracked version from bya repo due to not having a paypal account ifile and go varmobilelibrarygamekitdelayed requests and then delete comapplegamecenter and enjoy i only found this a few hours ago so i dont know if its a temporary or permanent fix but it works
jailbreak,removed,side load it idk
jailbreak,removed,fuck you every fucking pseudo jailbreakers and hackers i dont need your stupid buggy jailbreak i hope all of u get anal cancer and die very soon you dont deserve to live in this world all of you have sell your soul yo apple fuck mother fuckers
jailbreak,removed,fuck nigger
jailbreak,removed,but ramsay dies u know so theres still some good news
jailbreak,removed,just give up and die already
jailbreak,removed,so because i upvote it im automatically a pompous asshole go fuck yourself
jailbreak,removed,im from belgium to when i was on a jailbreak i had the same problem tsprotector couldnt do the job i think they use different techniques this is a thing when there is a jailbreak i can inspect and hopefully patch if there is someone who can decrypt the yelotv app via clutch on there jailbroken device i can give it a try
jailbreak,removed,roflolwmpofaweab rolling on floor laughing out loud with my penis out flopping around while eating a burrito
jailbreak,removed,for the ipa to appear you need a pirated app like appcake so you can get the ipa from it and install it with ipa installer when you install an application from the app store use something called rasticrac i think of clutch which cracks the app but really creates a ipa
jailbreak,removed,capacity is at should i delete all my tweaks and reinstall them what do you recommend
jailbreak,removed,how is what i said not making sense to you releasing a one click tool is not the same as jailbreaking i give full credit to the hard working devs who release these tools ive done independent research before i rip apart any tools released i prefer to challenge myself by seeing if i can do it myself then i compare the exploits i used to the ones used in the tool this allows me to see overlaps and determine what ill be able to save for later i have independently jailbroken ios without using one click tools you sound like a village idiot yelling witch when you cant wrap your meager mind around a few words also im not a troll just because i use a few curse words and assert myself fuck off cunt
jailbreak,removed,hurr durr im an autist cunt who refuses to accept new things and people piss off
jailbreak,removed,well insanely and big boss dont and i dont think ihackuriphone does either anyways how do i fix they were pre installed in cydia when i first got them except for ihackuriphone so they arent cracked
jailbreak,removed,i think insanelyi is legit but hackyouriphone is definitely a repo for cracked tweaks and apps
jailbreak,removed,cant find it on the appstore so i figure its not available here i downloaded it through appcake anyway they dont want my money p seems to be working fine
jailbreak,removed,i think there was a crack of some sort by the guy who wrote around the world in days thats a hint
jailbreak,removed,could i be a pain in the ass and ask for a step by step on how to get it cracking on my i have the app downloaded and it gives me an ios looking file browser what do i do next bro
jailbreak,removed,for those who want it free get it on hack your iphone repo
jailbreak,removed,youre a fucking idiot you couldve googled this or use the search bar dumbass
jailbreak,removed,install it with appcake i dont recommend it as its a pirate store but if this app is a legit free one you can get it from there
jailbreak,removed,can i jailbreak an iphone se running ios is there still a way to get in app purchases for free
jailbreak,removed,remindme hours
jailbreak,removed,try appcake
jailbreak,removed,its a free tweak retard
jailbreak,removed,get bombed
jailbreak,removed,you can try xcon there is also an unofficial version of xcon listed as version that worked for everything when i used it before switching to tsprotector i cant link you to it so youll have to google it it is totally not official so use it at your own risk
jailbreak,removed,remindme one day
jailbreak,removed,if you werent such an asshole maybe youd actually get a good response
jailbreak,removed,find a pirate repo and find the ad blocker
jailbreak,removed,this should work give it a try
jailbreak,removed,remind me days
jailbreak,removed,wtf this is the gayest post ever😂💯
jailbreak,removed,i know isnt that kid a cunt i bet he made the fake taiyi jailbreaking team twitter account just to make a video
jailbreak,removed,use appcake to download an old version of instagram that doesnt use that function i have
jailbreak,removed,itt a shitload pun intended of butthurt i swear this subreddit is far too contaminated with toxic naive entitled douchebagschildren creatix is being way too nice by spelling out their actions
jailbreak,removed,you just fuck off i will give attention to all the new jail breaking teams
jailbreak,removed,ah ok that makes a lot more sense i dont really use icloud so i didnt think of it thank you for actually giving a true response and not saying bye felicia like that other piece of shit
jailbreak,removed,fuck you nigger
jailbreak,removed,id mention the name but automod will sweep the leg it has no mercy its by unlimiapps though
jailbreak,removed,fuck off
jailbreak,removed,cool shitpost
jailbreak,removed,retard
jailbreak,removed,uninstall and reinstall iappcracker and the app also if possible
jailbreak,removed,so do i bunch of wankers
jailbreak,removed,ive been having trouble using the official versions of any of these apps that hide jailbreak but the one that works for me with both vipps and dnbs touch id app is xcon people say its not a real version but its the only version that works for me unfortunately the only place you can get it that i know of is from insanelyis repo
jailbreak,removed,all of them on my grab blobs for each then put them all on for my id leave it on or
jailbreak,removed,fuck your mom
jailbreak,removed,not jailbreak related but whoever the dumbass that wrote this is probably is a an employ or some shit or b a fuckin clickbaitasshole
jailbreak,removed,the morons tweeting him dont represent the common ideas of this subreddit if you are one of those idiots give your head a shake and pull it out if your ass at the same time these devs owe nothing to you no one does so stop making the rest of us look bad endrant
jailbreak,removed,download link mirror both links are error
jailbreak,removed,can people stop posting stupid posts like this seems like their is just way to many ass kissers and leg humpers making stupid posts he should have just kept hes mouth shut and release a jailbreak by surprise he knew what was going to happen when he opened hes big mouth again i hope he doesnt release it so all you leg humping ass kissers feel stupid
jailbreak,removed,why do people even take this troll seriously he has been a condescending asshole ever since you guys should stop giving him attention if he releases something use it if not then that was what youd expect anyway its that simple
jailbreak,removed,yea but i think the internet is making people worse more entitled anonymous super cunts
jailbreak,removed,more shit posts just be patient and we will see dont believe everything you see
jailbreak,removed,wrong hes a fggt kid
jailbreak,removed,hes literally only one person and hes been doing this for years making private jailbreaks getting called all kinds of things cause of no release the amount of shit being told to him could just make him not release he basically has the power of that right now and the only thing yall would say if he didnt release was oh i knew he was a phony oh what a fake cunt when it was yalls fault putting that kind of pressure thru him he already answered most questions he apparently joined a group chat to talk about it too so what is the point of answering the same question over and over again you know and this is from all around overseas people coming at him in chinese arabian expecting him to know what they are saying lol
jailbreak,removed,oh grow up and fuck yourself with your fucking opinion just because he doesnt give any update doesnt mean he was just fucking around ya little snowflake
jailbreak,removed,lol the work of an admin on insanelyi got snatched without even giving credit lool httpiimgurcomnybdlrzpng
jailbreak,removed,die you sarcastic cunt
jailbreak,removed,working on a jailbreak for all you impatient entitled fucks
jailbreak,removed,doing whatever he wants he doesnt have to take the time to make this jailbreak for entitled pieces of shit like you but he is so be grateful and wait
jailbreak,removed,i think youre looking for rshitposts
jailbreak,removed,omg the jailbreakapple community is a fucking joke you can get the iphone for a month on any service with deals no one hardly anyone buys outright you ignorant fuck and tweaks started as free and should be so no matter if your a developer tweaks should be developed for fun and to spread the fun to others not to make shit profit honest jailbreaking needs to stop no developer should help solely for this shit now a days attitude people have you want a jailbreak do your self you want a tweak do it your self plus people only seen to care about them selves and want dumb shit like snapchat hacks lol wtf how about put useful shit on your phone not ignorant socially shit fest media making everyone fucking unbearable and no one on here can make up their own mind always asking should i this should i that serious have a god damn brain cell and stop smoking you fucks
jailbreak,removed,another quote pangu released untethered jailbreak for ios now you can install fully functional cydia to any ios device using this pangu tool what does that mean than
jailbreak,removed,people are cunts let him do his job ffs and if you cant wait then make your own jailbreak
jailbreak,removed,stop spamming and use your brain
jailbreak,removed,sounds like all you little fuckers are just a bunch of cheap assholes to whoever doesnt think its equivalent with stealing is just lying to themselves to justify being a pile of shit human most of support emails received by devs are for tweaks not working due to being pirated pirated shit is why the best devs fun from this socalled community these days if youre too damn cheap for a whole one dollar you should probably sort out something else in your life maybe less hot pockets and mountain dew even if an ios jb comes out most of the stellar devs wont give a shit to help any of us out anymore rant downvote all you want that just proves how stellar this place has become s
jailbreak,removed,luca is a big fucking cunt he will never release anything he is just a little faker pussy fuck him

jailbreak,removed,you dont even need a jailbreak for that just use tutuhelper or one of those apps
jailbreak,removed,just another dumb person who cant read or search 😂
jailbreak,removed,lol your comments are a diatribe of the utmost echelon where did pangu acquire the exploits for their jb they sure as shit didnt find them themselves when you get a brain andor engage it spend a little time finding out why this jb is broken its broken because of the way machportal works now it seems the only way to fix is via a different exploit maybe maybe not but if luca is burning one of his own on then we all owe him big time time will tell
jailbreak,removed,download ifile and go to the root directory and delete everything and reboot

jailbreak,removed,youre a fucking idiot i literally have karma and from pcmasterrace how is that a karma mine just because you dont know how to download an ipsw doesnt mean you have to downvote and act like a bitch ipsw literally stands for iphone software
jailbreak,removed,no homo plz
jailbreak,removed,go fuck yourself and this sub
jailbreak,removed,wait so you were down voted so you act like a dick and down vote everyone else wow no wonder you guys think the community is filled with cunts
jailbreak,removed,i think im gonna wait till is released and maybe update then i think one lesson we can all learn from this clusterfuck is dont jump in with both boots was and has always been a beta tool for developers only all the fucktards that felt they had to jailbreak as soon as possible and twated their handsets are gonna have another bit of the apple pun intended i wonder how many have learned a valuable lesson i would imagine not many waiting for all the should i update to posts and all the help im in a boot loop posts wasnt it einstein who said there are two things infinite the universe and human stupidity im sure we will see this fact proved in the coming weeks joy
jailbreak,removed,oh but it is on your screenshot do you have openssh installed
jailbreak,removed,the developers from ihackyouriphone suggest that you delete the specified files with an app like ifile i did it myself and it worked tsmc yalu
jailbreak,removed,osx experience doesnt work last time i tried using it the developer has abandoned this package the dev uses drm and a licensing server which is no longer online it is impossible to use i wasted on his software which is still being sold its practically theft a real twat
jailbreak,removed,a thread of should i update to fucking shit this place is either filled with children who dont comprehend or straight regards
jailbreak,removed,which is why i didnt create another thread did you even read my post i asked if there was a guide available im not asking you to read it to me everyone has to act like a cunt round here dont they
jailbreak,removed,remindme weeks
jailbreak,removed,last political comment for the sake of the rules your acting as more power to the companies more jobs and such they are not obliged to use their powers for the good of others and in a competitive market such as the united states taking turns which increases profits is more on their minds than making sure americans are employeed also remember that those counties you listed all have one thing in common they are communist countries not capitalist countries so that explains why what bothers me is that trump wants to be in bed with the former soviet union that we had a cold war with and start bashing our own allies the fact he never criticized putin and always defends and praises him is insane lastly his childish mind that he shows on twitter and how will he put more effort into attacking celebrities makes him impossible to take him seriously i actively avoid shitty celebrity drama like tmz clevver news and such because what happens to these celebrities really dont mean much while what happens in politics is always serious business but it affects us all but our president elect wants to bitch about his show ratings and cry over twitter about some skit on saturday night live considering hes bitching left and right about taking away rights shows otherwise so no he is ganna bother our individual rights again last political comment to respect the subreddit rules
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,you need a modified deb to install with ifile or filza here is the modified deb

jailbreak,removed,how big was them tiddies
jailbreak,removed,thanks for coming here fellow jailbreaker as the top comment suggests the dr fone httpsdrfonewondersharecomiphonedatarecoveryhtml certainly does work the free version doesnt necessarily do much merely allows you to view previously deleted files however its full version is available on sale currently for which based on your current situation is an amount im assuming shouldnt necessarily be considered a problem also do not talk to any police officers investigators etc without your or a familiarised lawyer present law enforcement units use something called game theory which is a theory that was extended from forensic psychology also even though it is typically used in scenarios involving two or more charged individuals they still will use whatever they can they might seem as though they are trying to help but they typically are always on the side of the victim my best regards for the future keep us updated mate victim being a used for lack of a better term in your case
jailbreak,removed,here you go because it was so hard
jailbreak,removed,was it really that hard you couldnt do it

jailbreak,removed,that question raises the question of why people have put so much energy into coming up with what linguists call minced oaths eg gee gosh golly ciminy gosh darn it gee willikers and so on adnearlyinfinitum mince from the old french mincier means to chop into small pieces of course but since the century it has also been used to mean to make light of a matter or to minimize or lessen something to mince ones words is to restrain oneself and use polite language so to mince an oath is to neuter it into a supposedly inoffensive euphemism most major religions seem to have a prohibition against invoking the big cheeses name to denigrate your brotherinlaw so many minced oaths purportedly aim to avoid celestial censure but since any deity worth his or her salt knows what youre really thinking that gosh and golly are actually purely for the comfort of your listeners the gee in gee willikers which is a us invention is a minced oath for jesus on a par with gee jeeze and gee whiz gee itself first appeared in the us first found in print in which seems remarkably recent the first found in print dates of all such words are of course somewhat dubious indicators of their true age because many publications in the and centuries would probably have been reluctant to print even the neutered form of such oaths according to the oxford english dictionary the form jeeze or jeez is an even more recent arrival in print first appearing in gee willikers first appeared in print in the century in the form jewhilliken but the form geewillikin seems to have been the most popular early form like its relatives gee jeepers jeeze et al its primarily an interjection expressing surprise or amazement rather than serious anger or frustration the source and meaning of the willikers or williken component is unfortunately unknown and will probably remain a mystery one theory is that geewillikens was originally a substitution for jerusalem as an expression of surprise which was indeed popular in the century jeeroosalem you cant stand there the police wont allow it this theory was popular at the time when geewillikn or jewhilliken itself first appeared jerusalem a favorite new england exclamation in the west it is as usual improved to suit the louder taste of the people and becomes jewhillikin americanisms interestingly it seems likely that gee whiz which appeared at about the same time originated as a simplified form of geewillikins or gee willikers if gee willikers does indeed hark back to jerusalem then gee whiz and similar forms invoke both jesus and jerusalem of course jerusalem as an exclamation might itself have started as a minced oath of jesus

jailbreak,removed,im not kissing your ass fuck you and your jailbreak ios will be around before this beta gets done
jailbreak,removed,hes a piece of shit for teasing it and releasing unfinshed shit making people lose their stable jailbreak hoping that ios has a jailbreak hes a fucking dick no one else that released working jailbreaks worked in that childish manner so yeah he deserves everything coming to him including my insults fuck you lucas

jailbreak,removed,night shift sucks lol ipa deb
jailbreak,removed,there is but it involves piracy which is not good
jailbreak,removed,let me guess you dont know shit and youre defending him and accusing me of not knowing what im talking about let me put this into points so people like you can understand he had jailbreak ready long before stopped being signed yet decided hed start working on it after his weekend fun if you were on telegram that day youd have known this its never been his priority to release shit for the public he even said it and no im not grateful for it i never used it never will nor will i kiss his ass for it like yall doing he has beef with saurik hell he hates sauriks guts what are you talking about he disses aurik in his yolo rhymes mixtape or whatever they call it listen to kjc anthem for yourself and see and saurik clearly didnt like how luca handled everything regarding this jailbreak and knowing luca the cuck he is ofc hes gonna make a big deal out of it just like he did with ijaps yucca utilities yes it messed up with the jb but it wasnt that luca cared he raged nah it just hurt his ego you dont have the time or discipline to work on something then dont promise shit specially if youre going to be vague about it throughout the time i wonder how someone who can jailbreak an entire os and face a multibillionaire industry cant have the basic common sense to organize his shit literally assumed hes been working on futurerestore prometheus based on one fucking single tweet when he actually gave it a few hrs of his time to downgrade some devices to test his shit on i know hes delaying the jb after the signing window closes for so many reasons besides the saurik beef the fact that it affects his business one way or another hes doing it intentionally whether you believe it or not idc really dont really care if he helped pangu in the past or not im sure they couldve achieved their goals without him anyway if this gets to you on a personal level i am sorry but i dont genuinely care about this whole drama i left a comment stating my opinion and people went ape shit butthurt and started kissing his ass even more it is ridiculous if anything though time will tell whos right and whos wrong
jailbreak,removed,you have to find a deb online and install it with ifilefilza
jailbreak,removed,public release fuck off with that title
jailbreak,removed,your all a bunch of ungrateful twats plain and simple if this is so easy why not do it yourself there used to be a time in the jb scene where it was fun and filled with lots of devs willing to work on this kind of thing once money and greed and then ungrateful assholes come along and make these guys get all pissed off to the point where most dont care enough to return and make or contribute to a new jailbreak i wouldnt be surprised if more then of the people here are little kids bitching about something they dont even truly understand thanks luca and good for you for being done after this cause there will come a time when all these babies cry about no jailbreak some of you guys need to either go outside get laid or kill your self your all a waste
jailbreak,removed,install the tvos profile to prevent those
jailbreak,removed,i see the profile was removed if you want it just do a quick
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,i dont blame luca people are fucking idiotic when he teases a jailbreak and doesnt release it people get pissed when he releases a beta not for regular users and tells people to not use it people bitch and complain that it doesnt fully work or that it fucked up their device when he says hes ging to work on it to fix the issues and release a final working public version people get upset because its taking too long unbelievable the nerve that most of the idiotic fuckers here have to be demanding something of him if i were luca i wouldnt release shit not now and not in the future and yes itd be horrible for me as well since i am unable to use some of my work apps on but id be fine suffering without a jailbreak just so the rest of the stupid assholes in here suffer as well
jailbreak,removed,just had a read of some of that guys tweets he is one entitled little cunt if i was getting that kind of shit theres no way id be finishing a jailbreak for anyone shame some people just have to spoil shit
jailbreak,removed,he is doing this work for free and there are some absolutely ungrateful twats out there being annoying i mean yes ive heard about his past with rjailbreak and all but still this is free stuff so the least people can do is be grateful

jailbreak,removed,its been said a prophet is without any honor in his own country and a wise man said nothing at all here i get scrutinized for my punctuation and my rants and rambles i have been banned a few times but thanks to vpns new emails advance asciii and host offshore smpte servers i can come back and keep on cursing these dumb asses on here out my point is well thinking if i had one no look bro keep doing what you do respect you expect because you show it first and your a man you dont always get it return but know this love respect run hand in hand and are a lot alike if not exactly in many ways you look at things unconditionally you hold up and do what you do regardless of these other immature fucks that expect something for nothing you make a mistake then hold up fuck how it turns out i been through a bunch of shit and actually my people skills are good to a point but if you a pussy bitch ass nigga then get on down i mean real talk i been hacking shit for years and fixing things helping other contributing my time my skills and most my life to help and benefit others but truth is if listen close i tell you once with you once about something how it works even step you through but you might not get a second chance and this is how it is not always the case and i am not saying this to you but in general its how i look at things i know this i am simple if i walk down the street and a dog bites me then next time i walk down that street that fucking dog aint gonna fuck wit me no more he wont bite me again shit that dog aint gonna be alive ya feel me the same dog dont bite twice look the people on here that honestly know contribute and even do tweaks they know what they are doing its easy to go into substrate with its safe mode and measures disable something on the same token its not a good thing to neglect something at all close attention to detail is appreciated and respected my point is this if you doing anything technical and its on a jailbreak then the person needs to have some knowledge of what they do before they install a tweak i noticed on cydia that it ask when you instal user or should be safeguards etc maybe fuck maybe i need to go back in my hole and play with the bootrom of my ramtin nvme reader anyways you all good

jailbreak,removed,ok

jailbreak,removed,using cydia i dont know if you need a repo for it as i am not jailbroken at this moment also go to youareanidiotorg
jailbreak,removed,not sure but i can say that appcake is working flawlessly
jailbreak,removed,because it needs to update please if you feel that you know better just stop it and do the damn troubleshooting yourself
jailbreak,removed,tfw the only way you can find a way to respond is to correct someones spelling of your
jailbreak,removed,pornhubcom
jailbreak,removed,ios jailbreak release jailbreak info download nownot available yet
jailbreak,removed,well then i recommend pornhubcomgayporn
jailbreak,removed,hey can you check if any of the iap crackers are working iap crazy iap free
jailbreak,removed,i would recommend appcake you can choose to download any version of the ipas that are stashed in their torrent searches you can also use it to install apps that require an ios upgrade however keep in mind some work others dont i did this to install the directv app im on need and it wont work the app simply crashes due to a miss matched api framework i can write up a guide on how to attempt a force install using appcake if anyone wants one however i honestly dont think its worth it as many apps actually do require an upgrade in order to function
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,pervert
jailbreak,removed,remindme weeks
jailbreak,removed,does appcake work
jailbreak,removed,fucking idiots jailbreaking with no knowledge does the search bar also give you a blackscreen
jailbreak,removed,niggas were gonna jb if it was safe or not
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,used that link and instructions and had to use ifile but as you can see it works also the regular cydia one isnt compatible i think 🤔😅 so i got that one
jailbreak,removed,its private stop posting his tweets for sakes
jailbreak,removed,love your tweaks especially youtube
jailbreak,removed,im not certain but i suspect the nonoptimal display of an image is just using a uiwebviewcontroller so that its just rendered in a miniature web browser basically this is as opposed to the native viewer that the author of this tweak would tie into if my speculation is correct
jailbreak,removed,the search bar on the subreddit you fucking moron
jailbreak,removed,having the same problem anyone have a mirror
jailbreak,removed,sweet so i can download an app on my iphone and install it on my iphone using ifile installous and it should work correct
jailbreak,removed,i actually use a tweak called cydown with all the pirating features turned off cuz it actually caches all the tweaks debs you install wish someone would make a legit version of it not for pirating
jailbreak,removed,download app cake and extract your apps and the installed it from ifubbox or itools
jailbreak,removed,youre a reposting account grooming karmawhoring faggot who lies steals content and has negative comment karma for good reasons
jailbreak,removed,sent to me via pm loll you mad bitch go suck your dads dick mother fucker
jailbreak,removed,im pretty sure there are no tweaks that can mod online games as for offline games you can download localiappstore
jailbreak,removed,no i didnt use it but the repo updated it to work in ios quick switch between multiple appleids fixed for ios
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,idk dude but heres the guide proof httpimgurcomqeijmcs you can freely redistribute the article its not mandatory to mention about me but if you want you can credit me via httptwittercomatillaersoy hey there i was recently messing around theosjailed while i trying to repack packages i have figured a way to install same app for etc times on non jb phone first of all youre gonna need mac os x if youre windows user you can download the vmware image and use xcode or greater imodsign theres no official link so just google it ios app signer first of all youre need to create a blank project on the xcode fix the codesigning issues the steps place your desired apps ipa file on the desktop drag it in to imodsign open the settings pane of imodsign click the certificate chooser select your free or paid account and click use this certificate with imodsign navigate to librarymobiledeviceprovisioning profiles copy your provisioning profile to desktop click the provision profile chooser and provide the profile that youve copied tick the remove application metadata httpimgurcomacfxhro now click on the start job itll resign the ipa and extract to selected location now open the ios app signer select the ipa that youve signed with the imodsign now select the developer account and the provisioning profile now important type the app display name but name it differently resign it and install the ipa file with the sideloading method now you can repeat the steps and install the same app as much as you want without jailbreak its effective even on the whatsapp you can also change the icons before doing steps listed above open the ipa file with winrar in the payload directory navigate to app directory and find the png icon files replace them with desired icon for example i used whatsapp and it worked i also listed the png files that i changed please note you will not able to get updates on the second app but original app will be fine if youre having trouble try to use an ipa file that decrypted you can download them in app addict kinda websites you can redistribute this method share it anywhere but please really please do not use this method for piracy

jailbreak,removed,this community is full of shits
jailbreak,removed,my bad everybody need to get of my dick
jailbreak,removed,i have a service called perkstore if you are anything familiar with sideloading this should help a ton we provide you with access to tweaked appsgames and provide you with profiles to sign you own apps we are still rolling out but pricing will cost between let me know if you are interested
jailbreak,removed,i just read on that once the public version of ios comes out a jailbreak will be
jailbreak,removed,it literally tells you on the website anyways i have been using it for a year now it also you to download apps outside from the apple store without having to use a computer normally these sideloaded apps can be signed for days but when you use ipawind there is no weekly limit it can also duplicate and rename apps i have three whatsapps on my device for different people i talk to it also has a section with tweaked apps such as tweaked snapchat whatsapp youtube no ads background playback etc spotify unlimited skips

jailbreak,removed,hes a faggot
jailbreak,removed,wish mods would ban his name as a keyword i feel like this guy loves the attention and will never stop posting proof of his jailbreaks and thus we will never stop seeing posts like these cant we just assume from this point on that every ios can be jail broken and stop posting his picturesvideos of his jailbreaks that he will never release he seems like such a pretentious douchebag
jailbreak,removed,how is it that everyone else is able to get what this guy has accomplished but youre so retarded that even after being told multiple times you still dont get it stay in school you stupid fuck
jailbreak,removed,youre a fool if you think fbi is a cluster fuck of people from many different backgrounds who dont care about you they care about everyones data more correctly they care about having access to it when they want to and youre an even bigger fool if you think apple really cares about your privacy they care about their reputation as a company who protects privacy but pretending and actually doing it are two different things you probably think that the crash was orchestrated by terrorists as well but you look like the typical american dumb loser who smokes weed all day and his most used words are dude wtf and omg

jailbreak,removed,vidyo youll have to download it from appcake as it is an app that was pulled from the appstore
jailbreak,removed,this guy is so useless jailbreak can be achieved in every ios its about releasing it to the public this nigga has his iphone so far up his ass that this is shit all

jailbreak,removed,fuck you troll
jailbreak,removed,spot the difference now might be a great time to reconsider your stance on piracy modmyi prevents you from purchasing tweaks that dont explicitly support the firmware your device is on and now you know why insanelyi and perhaps other pirate repos have no such version checks in place and will allow you to install any tweaks to any device

jailbreak,removed,can i get a iphone jailbreak plz
jailbreak,removed,for u can have it siggned for a year wwwappdbcc thats how mine is signed a year already
jailbreak,removed,right im not donating money thats going to get taken anyways lets pay to throw it away atleast with appdb cheapest site to sign apps ive found and if your cert is revoked they fix it already happened twice so why would i gave money to throw it away lol makes no sense and people clearly dont look at all the options
jailbreak,removed,lol thats why i have it on devices altho i have learned from those other app sites u buy the dev shit and use appdb free and u can link your own devices next year ill do that method already less then away from a dev licence anyways but yea idk bought other services but appdb does fix any issues and you can become an uploader and earn via appdb i became staff and stopped uploading hahahaha but worth the investment also without appsync its key to have
jailbreak,removed,exactly at the time of each device my only investment was and when the certs get fucked appdb fixes them not you pay licence revoked licence revoked no refund appdb cert revoked hrs later fixed idk bought you but that sounds alot easyer
jailbreak,removed,and also appdb is nonprofit if your an uploader anyone can apply you can get paid to do so if u wanted to make extra ontop of the cert
jailbreak,removed,nah but ill suck his dick for bucks
jailbreak,removed,i use ipa store to sign yalu and youre right a mod shouldnt even remove this post if they want to because using ipa store or talking about it is no different than people talking about appsync yeah you can use it for piracy but i dont i used it for a modded snapchat when it worked and now for signing yalu

jailbreak,removed,does anyone have an ipa to share is this by any chance a trickery to get the pegasus shit on your phone
jailbreak,removed,can someone please put the ipa in a shared dropbox folder
jailbreak,removed,someone who can send me the ipa so that i can download it because it is gone from appstore
jailbreak,removed,anyone got a mirror of the app
jailbreak,removed,can anyone share the ipa for this
jailbreak,removed,the app is pulled out by apple minutes back any one can share ipa file
jailbreak,removed,but even with appcakeappsync
jailbreak,removed,im probably going to to make a fake apple id with the email and password showing so both you guys can install it yourself but probably one asshole is going to change the password
jailbreak,removed,still there is a hope we can install it through ipa file those who have downloaded can upload it and we can install it anyways
jailbreak,removed,is there a way someone can re uplod it as an ipa so we install it or what
jailbreak,removed,i can send you the ipa file if that helps
jailbreak,removed,unfortunately i have no idea about app singning all i can do is share my ipa with you
jailbreak,removed,another store like appcake doesnt can upload that on their store
jailbreak,removed,hey man i need the ipa can you upload it somewhere google drive or meganz
jailbreak,removed,who exactly is they youre a moron theres no fixing that
jailbreak,removed,not a bug youre just an idiot maybe jailbreaking isnt for you
jailbreak,removed,do you think you could find a way to possibly get an ipa file and be able to install it via appcake or some sort of similar method maybe with a pc
jailbreak,removed,cant you use ifile to change it back again ps these people are cunt fuck em
jailbreak,removed,is a working link
jailbreak,removed,oh its gone wait if i download it through something like app cake or some app store pirating tweak would that work i dont have any of those installed right now so i cant check
jailbreak,removed,mirror
jailbreak,removed,can someone post a link to the ipa
jailbreak,removed,localiap gamegem
jailbreak,removed,go to cydiasourceseditadd and add this let the cydia do the talking then go to search and type localiapstore ios and install it after respring go to setting and look for localiapstore tap it and then toggle both options to on now in most of the game you will have free in app purchases
jailbreak,removed,here´s the link guys
jailbreak,removed,link
jailbreak,removed,if you can just use wwwonlinejailbreakcom its the one i use and it gives you the year cert
jailbreak,removed,pandolife is a good one it allows downloading as well
jailbreak,removed,hello rjailbreak as a way of giving back to the community and from small jokes posted earlier regarding a paypal share i wanted to take the time to give back for those of you that were unable to download pg client before it was removed from the appstore below you will find an account i have tied to my main account that will allow you to download pg client youll find it under both michaels purchases and josephs purchases username pgclientdownloadicloudcom password the period is part of the password rules please do not change the password be kind to others thats all i ask if you care to donate you may via paypal any donations are appreciated imikeybmecom any questions comments or concerns ill do my best to answer them thank you rjailbreak stay strong as a community
jailbreak,removed,i tried posting but the mods removed it for mirroring which is ridiculous but sure

jailbreak,removed,i dont know if im against the rules now but i used a lot of effort to read the rules i couldnt find anything against sharing appcake because its not pirated cydia tweaks or apps i couldnt read it all my adhd took over 😝 but here we go the newest version for this week then its easy the ipa will be downloaded in varmobilemediaappcake
jailbreak,removed,you sound like every other entitled cunt of your generation you didnt have the money for stuff so you just stole it because you wanted it you sir are a cunt
jailbreak,removed,gtfo
jailbreak,removed,some pirate ones are not updated properly but if im not mistaken hackyouriphone repo works just fine but i recommend you to buy the original one to support the developer
jailbreak,removed,dont be an asshole
jailbreak,removed,i think your antivirus is blocking the download disable it and try again if issue persist dm me and i will send you a mirror
jailbreak,removed,google hipstore and download it from them you will get a second app
jailbreak,removed,stop pirating tweak for gods sack just pay for them you asshole and you dont bother to search your problem with storage was aaked times already

jailbreak,removed,i installed it but nothing happens
jailbreak,removed,installous
jailbreak,removed,what is wrong with appcake besides people being against piracy
jailbreak,removed,excuse for this late reply didnt notice your response yes i figured that out i did not actually find pentesting tools zero i believe i did download scany from the app store also available on appcake for reconnaissance it gives you the ability to scan for open ports on hosts and devices on your network and probably some more things its okay i got iwep pro big boss too its similiar to ispeedtouched maybe you know it from a while ago it searches for default passwords for wifi networks what about you
jailbreak,removed,its almost as bad as the can you help me figure this out how about you just not do that instead type of response so frustrating go away asshole i wasnt asking if i should do it i was asking how its done
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,through appcake it wont let me
jailbreak,removed,i tried doing that and then got told that i couldnt provide mirrors for the deb supposedly so youd have to do a bit of searching on google on your own to download it
jailbreak,removed,i think you should shut the fuck up and dont use stupid answers the man clearly said in the title what we wants and you being so fucking idiot couldnt make it to your small brain please people end this ignorance
jailbreak,removed,oh okay well i installed it thru hackyouriphone but the winklock only depends on the repo
jailbreak,removed,you have just cracked the app using rasticrac

jailbreak,removed,when i was i wanted to put ios on an old iphone spring i installed thus having to jailbreak but unfortunately the wifi didnt work making it impossible to install any tweaks or apps after that i was almost during the summer of when i upgraded to an iphone from a moto x the same phone i am typing on right now it was on and i wasnt interested in jailbreaking at the time a couple of months later i started to become interested in jailbreaking againdecember february but unfortunately i was on ios where at the time no jailbreak existed by the summer of i was on the ios beta when i found out a ios jailbreak had come out i instantly downgraded my phone through a ipsw i happened to have on my computer thus why im on and not im happy to say that as of right now im a happy jail breaker
jailbreak,removed,im not sure if this is allowed but you can try
jailbreak,removed,dat android fag
jailbreak,removed,request a refund then pirate it should fix it
jailbreak,removed,thats the best part pirates remove the drm real people who buy the tweak suffer while pirates get everything working fine a repo where one bites your apples may be able to help you out this for me is the only appropriate time to pirate when theyre stealing your money
jailbreak,removed,im sorry but youre making a distinguishment that just doesnt exist an actual informal spelling is a meaningless term you can easily argue that u is also an actual informal spelling given how vague and arbitrary its connotations are anyway my point is that neither should be used in a formal setting both are basically just like text speak just because you see it written thru on signs all over america doesnt mean you should use it in your own writing as the guy said above it just looks tacky and in my opinion uneducated
jailbreak,removed,remindme

jailbreak,removed,the beta stage of testing is released after the alpha stage of software testing during the beta stage software is usually released to the general public or a select user base to find bugs or complications with the software due to the varying nature of each different jailbreak and each different software out there the eta on a beta drastically changes nbsp if the beta has no major issues showing up the final could come out in a day or two if a critical and hard to solve bug is revealed or occurs then it could take an indefinite amount of time to resolve

jailbreak,removed,for a superior being you dont understand some shit for one as a superior being you seem to think inferior beings have the capacity to identify you as a superior being they dont they cant tell by looking at you nor can they tell if you know what you are talking about if they were smart enough to identify you as a superior being theyd be smart enough to know what they are fucking talking about they dont two only a moron goes to an apple store with a hardware issue with a jailbreak still installed what are the chances you are going to be dealing with a superior being maybe in at best by leaving the jailbreak on you not only gave inferior beings a free ticket to deny you you mandated them to deny you its like going to a movie theater with a candy bar in your pocket the ticket taker doesnt give a fuck that he sees a bulge in your pocket he knows its not your dick hes been working his job a long time he just needs plausible deniability so he can ignore it but when you walk up to the ticket taker with a candy bar in your other hand the ticket taker has to say sorry you cant bring that in here he has no plausible deniability when you take a jailbroken iphone with a hardware problem to an apple store you are not allowing the similarly moronic inferior being to have plausible deniability he is then forced to call you out on it as a superior being you need to step it up and become a high functioning superior being not this halfbaked if i said it and im right thats all that should matter piece of shit version of a superior being hope that helped

jailbreak,removed,they dont ask because nobody ever answered them thus reducing the overall post count on the contrary it creates more posts about the same person what if the question has never been answered and then you tell them to search it up idk why people have to be such dicks about it if you dont know the answer then dont answer stop being such a fucking dick not directed at you but at everyone who does that and just fucking leave people alone this is a forum to ask questions and discuss jailbreak it is those people that ruin this subreddit not the people that ask questions

jailbreak,removed,man girls are fucked
jailbreak,removed,dude is open thief fuck you and fuck him
jailbreak,removed,lmao i am atleast smarter then you go ahead and pay for tweaks that you can get for free lmfao and i dont need job to be able to pay for tweaks that cost
jailbreak,removed,it means pangu stole from your paypal account
jailbreak,removed,and fuck you too
jailbreak,removed,i have messages them unfortunately they either think im trying to get a tweak for free or just ignore my emails also i have used other emails but once i log out of my vpn i get banned also paying a month for a vpn is not worth it although i do use it to torrents lol also its not a good idea to use paypal for me since i get banned every month after getting my account linked to my previous one so because of that tweaks that require purchase outside of cydia for example phantom for snapchat it would be complicated since i have to enter my email having to memorize different emails per tweak will get confusing im sure ive tried calling paypal explaining them a jail broken phone is just like a computer its not meant for piracy just for customizing but they still rejected my appeal fuck paypal if saurik enabled purchase with credit cards or google payment i would never pirate tweaks since they are cheap in fact i have hundreds of dollars worth of tweaks that i bough before getting banned now i have no choice but to pirate do i feel bad a little bit but even if i dont download a pirated tweak it wont stop others from pirating in the end the real ahole here is saurik for removing amazon as a form of payment so until saurik accepts other payment methods ill continue to pirate go ahead and downvote me whoever is reading this idc also i just got colorflow and am loving it but sadly my paypal got banned so i wont be able to pay it oh well

jailbreak,removed,back a while ago there was a tweak that would spoof in app purchase so you could buy a shit load of micro transactions for free it seemed kinda frowned upon but i used it all the time just cant remember the name of it
jailbreak,removed,hi is anybody else having trouble downloading the ipa file from the pangu website its only and its been ridiculously slow downloaded in an hour does anybody have a mirror website to download it from any help would be greatly appreciated
jailbreak,removed,

jailbreak,removed,you mean for an apple dev account ipastore clarifying for other people reading
jailbreak,removed,you should be redirected a few times until you get to a screen that looks like from here click on open in on the top left corner and then click on if you dont see it scroll to the left on the middle bar until you find it from here youll be sent to the filza app click on the new file that appears a new folder named ios lock and keyboard sounds should appear enter the folder tap and hold on one of the folders inside and then click on the other folder you should have the two folders highlighted now click on the copy button at the bottom of the screen if a pop up comes out at the bottom left corner just click skip click on the back arrow in the top right corner until you reach the end of the menus root directory go to library themes click on the little clipboard in the bottom left corner then click paste go to your home screen and open the anemone app once loaded click on the enable button next to the miscellaneous menu click on the apply button in the top right and then apply again your device should respring and once its done you should have the lock and keyboard sounds from ios beta

jailbreak,removed,so i get it that it is a clear answer to the question i am asking so does that mean that i need to lock it with a passwordlock screen
jailbreak,removed,restore your phone completely in itunes restore the backup from before you jailbroke your phone rejailbreak you will also have to reinstall your tweaks that you had
jailbreak,removed,i do not want to comment any tweaks that i have installed due to it being piracy but i will dm you
jailbreak,removed,facebook plus plus x plus sign
jailbreak,removed,i dont know anything about new exploit but did you know if you gently stroke unicorns well corn it will shoot out rainbows

jailbreak,removed,fucking retard its a direct question
jailbreak,removed,you dont know shit nigga
jailbreak,removed,jailbreaking can help you get older versions of apps all you need is appsync you can then either get the apps through appcake directly on your phone or find the ipa online and sync it through itunes on your pcmac
jailbreak,removed,you dont need to jailbreak to get older versions of an app
jailbreak,removed,yea no problemi already solved it theme is licek and i believe you can get it from the insanelyi repo
jailbreak,removed,also for the notifications i have the kecil which is also from the insanelyi repo
jailbreak,removed,i̇f someone can say me how to get alienblue i̇ would be happy it is not in appstoreappcake so where is this app
jailbreak,removed,use hipstore it creates a duplicate notifications dont work though

jailbreak,removed,english translated transcript main chat lei feng network exclusive interview to the dawn of the core team members listen to him about the latest trends and mosec pangu team jailbreak how hard is ios lei feng network why did you show ios beta version of the jailbreak video on mosec in fact this is our temporary decision we would want to take the show to jailbreak and look but just a few weeks ago on the wwdc apple released ios we did a little research and found out that vulnerabilities that we had however in ios was blown away we feel that undefeated although the time is very tight but we still managed to find new vulnerabilities complete ios beta version of the jailbreak in the live video this purpose is very simple is to tell you pangu team is still working hard we have the ability to get what you want in on the latest systems lei feng network on ios apples security mechanism to do what upgrade now apple just released version ios beta according to the existing situation there is no significant improvement in appearance security mechanism but the use of the kernel patching security mechanisms also sandbox security has been improved on for example our vulnerabilities until you are ready there is a sandbox for the escape the security mechanism this vulnerability works and in the ios on not working but you know this is just the first test version in future beta or official version apple is likely to make a major upgrade sin ecurity it often happened before lei feng network that being the case how hard was it to jailbreak ios there is a young man in italy luca todesco has recently been put jailbreak ios picture but he recently said on twitter the vulnerability he fouded are abolished in ios for now no one outside released news that a breakthrough in the ios so i do not know how other people feel like however with our skills we have already make a breakthrough so we dont feel that it is very difficult lei feng network do pangu team plan to release a jailbreak tool for ios we currently have no plans to release the jailbreak tool because you know some loopholes not only can be used to jailbreak it can be use to cause other security issues to the users as well by releasing a jailbreak tool it means that other researchers including apple can see what loopholes we use although we jailbreak ios and ios security products using two different sets of vulnerabilities but announcing a vulnerability is likely to inspire other hackers exposing our other vulnerabilities this is our reason for caution from the situation in the world now we dont feel pressured because the opponents progress does not look optimistic so well wait and see lei feng network in addition to you who do you think has the skills to produce the jailbreak i just said italian guy has been engaged in ios related studies having published yalu jailbreak before he might have a possibility of doing so cohen then domestic laboratories had broken off in mobile the iphone on ios macos security is also useful lei feng network this is the second year of pangu held mosec mobile security technology summit and what is the difference compared to the first one intuitively the size is doubled and we feature is the top class mobile security technology so the technical level is very high lei feng network technical supports are sharing what top technology tell us about it us hacker jl issue is to start ios and android security mechanism analysis when ios system starts it will start from the boot load of things be verified to ensure that every moving towards the lower deck are safe even during the boot phase followed by the code is encrypted so you can not see its firmware is how it works of course in earlier versions of ios some hackers have been found bootrom loopholes which is breaking the start of this chain such breakthroughs can take over at the earliest stage of a mobile phone not even lose the password to unlock this step the phone can be taken over by us you know but now that vulnerability is difficult to find because the startup phase of the process is not very complicated but simple analysis loading check the probability of the existence of risk is not high however recently in the android system the introduction of a similar security chain mechanism for android system this new feature is added so there may be some loopholes his topic is detailed security mechanisms both similarities and differences further research inspired other hackers do another cohen laboratory issues they demonstrated the use of a android system vulnerabilities this vulnerability is their latest discovery from their speeches the quality of this vulnerability is very high it should be able to pass to kill all of the android system the vulnerability has been reported to the manufacturers but because google has not yet released a patch so they did not have to explain the details of the exploit lei feng network talk about your issues about it we found some new vulnerabilities apple system mechanism some coprocessor firmware protected and not signed so we can through these vulnerabilities configuration deformity code to control coprocessor we are also there are no good methods of use can be achieved using the system level such as escape we also found a flaw apple underlying data sharing mechanisms if you take pictures with the camera app system in other app can actually without your permission you take pictures in an instant from the memory image to get it in it can be the equivalent of your photographs directly steal this can cause serious privacy issues we did verify that any one app can achieve such a monitoring function but also strutted through appstore validation of course we finally showcased ios jailbreak lei feng network i heard some mysterious scene to the audience yes two from israel come they come just to help the fbi cracked iphone that portion of cellebrite vulnerability to them is very important they are also familiar with what we do so this time they register themselves over there is also a team of people from apple they are of course very concerned about what we are doing so in advance to say hello say they want to take a look lei feng network when apples team saw you all jailbreak ios what was their expression ha ha ha ha ha ha in addition to escape pangu recent study also secret weapons i recently did a ios equipment safety monitoring system the system can detect if your iphone was hacked or place malicious things this is regarded as our first product for sale the demand for business and government for example identify leadership mobile phone in the end it safe lei feng network apples system is the possibility of a large black do xcodeghost last years outbreak everyone notices apple systems are not secure there are many hidden deeper than the attack on the inside and apple for the app on the appstore verify the existence of a defect many people have achieved with a verified through apple app downloaded in the background trojan attack lei feng network this system how to recognize an attack behavior in general if you want to have an app malicious behavior we must mention the right inside the system before you can view the someone else thing from the system level this kind of operation would leave marks we will use their grasp of vulnerabilities file integrity can be verified the process of inspection the signature check such attacks can be identified since our analysis is based on signature verification and behavior it is possible to discover unknown threats lei feng network let me say jailbreak it pangu core team a few people how do you division of labor our core team of six people tb south korea win glory chen xiaobo wang tielei windknown xu hao and i had demigod every time there are research division for example you just find a flaw in it i was there a dig holes finally we pieced together tested together fit in order to achieve the final escape now we basically do not stay up late unless there is an important node for example soon to be released jailbreak lei feng network search for lei feng net number of public concern talk about your impressive jailbreak story this time last year we have attached a boil two weeks of the night just to release ios jailbreak we saw from the last release with only two days the first tai chi team released their jailbreak tool the same version of ios if there are two teams simultaneously released jailbreak tool is a waste of vulnerabilities so this means we rush week tools can not be released that we really depressed but we can not rest you need to immediately make their jailbreak tool technology to track to see if there hit the holes own and use the same vulnerability fortunately that did not hit a hole we can still use the weapons in the next version lei feng network how many loopholes in your hand our reserve is very rich if apple plugging loopholes now we can still escape with another set of vulnerabilities our hands have at least two sets of holes
jailbreak,removed,i managed to do exactly what youre trying unfortunately as you probably know by now without being on an os that is jailbreakable it is impossible btw if you manage to do it beware that youll need appsync straight off of the apps on the appstore dont have a version that is ios compatible on file so youll have to download the apps you want from thirdparty websites and an alien blue ipa is virtually impossible to find non pirated if you need any help i did this back in january as i kept my ipad on ios before downgrading and have some experience with the ipad on ios feel free to dm me
jailbreak,removed,i really hate him kind of f idiot

jailbreak,removed,youre a fucking idiot
jailbreak,removed,well i know that the sub doesnt support pirated stuff but in this case since its free i dont see the issue when you use it in this situation so i know that if you try appcake and appsync you can install gboard but im not suggesting you use appcake for pirating paid apps though as the developers work very hard for apps and most paid apps cost way less than they are worth
jailbreak,removed,fuck off
jailbreak,removed,remindme
jailbreak,removed,i was going down on my grandma when i tasted horse cum oh i said to myself thats how she died

jailbreak,removed,what version of localiapstore
jailbreak,removed,there are lots of condition to get post approved due to auto moderator i think some real moderators are needed to block shits like you who post the shitted for which we dont give a shit you piece of shit 🤓
jailbreak,removed,you can do that with in app purchases but appsync isnt working atm do not try to install it this subreddit doesnt reply to cracking apps and stuff so you just have to google it
jailbreak,removed,hey take the way you feel about my english offsets patches etc and stick it with your middle finger up your ass then take your pinky finger and shove it in your pussy you side loaded fuck twerp criticle minded fucking tool of a turdsmere you fucking kucking holyjesusfuckstick pussyfestering cockscum i will try to work on patching my motherfucking english just for you fuckstick

jailbreak,removed,im not really sure what you mean by that but if you mean what jailbreaking has done for you and memories it has made then here goes i first jailbroke my ipod touch when it was on ios and i didnt understand it at first i didnt know what to do so i just left cydia there i decided to learn what to do with cydia and managed to get some tweaks that i liked such as barrel and zeppelin i loved them tweaks for me anyway they made my ipod stand out so much from everything else the custom animations were cool aswell although i havent jailbroken a device in a long time im waiting for the stable release of ios jailbreak i was one of them people that would decrypt the csv of games like clash of clans and clash royale and then look at them its fun i still do it now but a jailbreak helped me alot with that even though i generally use apks instead it helped me some good tweaks i enjoyed barrel zeppelin ifile localiapstore didnt use that much but hey enjoyed it on single player games spinout i think thats the name of the spinning icons on the home page watchspring i generally like to customize my phone alot and it looks nice
jailbreak,removed,quit being an asshole

jailbreak,removed,he had his fame on twitter with him releasing videos of jailbroken iphones people begging for public release of jailbreak and he asking them to fuck off with a public jb finally out he is simply trying to stay relevant
jailbreak,removed,except appcake has free apps too and this has moving to do with it
jailbreak,removed,appsync unified and appcake both work fine
jailbreak,removed,does anyone have a mirror link that has downloaded it already its downloading at which is driving my crazy with anticipation

jailbreak,removed,can you please help me its stopping at a mirror though pm would help maybe mega or mediafire
jailbreak,removed,rjailbreak every single human okay also i said if that happened then the majority would rather buy a developer account than restore i stand by that statement one would not need to do it straight away given that jailbreaks are now taking almost a year to come out would you restore instantly or wait for the money buy a account to install the jailbreak also theres nothing to stop us sharing developer account to install the app so aside from the fact that this most likely wont happen the whole argument is pointless
jailbreak,removed,its ok i down voted all of these fucking idiots i never thought id see the you shouldnt have anything to worry about if you have nothing to hide trope on here gtfo kids you missed the forest for the trees pokémon go is that way rpokemongo

jailbreak,removed,i am sorry it was in my clipboard but forgot to link it
jailbreak,removed,no need to mod any deb get this one works well eclipse is on there too
jailbreak,removed,remindme days
jailbreak,removed,heres a link to the deb download it in safari and open it in ifile then install from there and it should work 🙂
jailbreak,removed,you can jailbreak by visiting httpsyaluqwertyoruiopcom and using cydia impacted which you can get from httpwwwcydiaimpactorcom once you have both of those things open up impactor and plug your i device in then drag the ipa into cydia impactor and follow the onscreen instructions once the app is installed open setting then go to generalprofiles and device management and then trust the app it is pretty stable but check before installing any tweaks to make sure its compatible once the final version comes out you can update with no issues hope this helps i have made a custom version of the ipa with this you can download it from
jailbreak,removed,fuck you beat me to it
jailbreak,removed,alright so for those of you who are still having trouble with installing betterfiveicondock and fivebettercolumnhomescreen this is what worked for me i installed the deb provided in this thread via filza i went ahead and installed it and went to cydia find the betterfive tweaks you want and i hit install at the top right and when the menu at the bottom opened i clicked downgrade i let it go through the install and then once done i clicked the home button and hit substratefix thats what worked for me hope its some added help to some

jailbreak,removed,lol this morning i was just checking all my repos and what tweaks they have and by chance i found soundcloudpro on tonys repo works fabulous on witth updated soundcloud tested this morning
jailbreak,removed,one of the most reliable and simple to use tweak is silentmode switcher it is a paid tweak but if you installed pirated repositories on cydia you can install it for free once it is installed head to activator app and choose an action which will trigger the tweak in my case i used double tap on status bar as the triggering action trust me friends this tweak really works that too like a charm if you want to consider other tweaks as well try auto silent it is also a paid tweak but comes with automatic and manual switching functionality

jailbreak,removed,would you mind posting back if you like ipawind thinking about this myself
jailbreak,removed,nope for example i have started my adventure with my friend than i got into iphone with jb and then until ios i was on twitter sinful

jailbreak,removed,sincerely go fuck yourself op people like you are why the sub is so bloody toxic its like giving a student test he has not studied for and only allowing him to study for it if he passes the test get of your bloody high horse op you were once a noob as well just like everyone else so dont go around trying to act all high and mighty limiting what others who are new to jailbreaking can or cannot do on the sub

jailbreak,removed,downgrade your impactor ill post the link in one second
jailbreak,removed,bro try out appsync it really makes your control center look very clean and modern after installing it you can customize it in the settings
jailbreak,removed,i saw another user post this already and it works credits to himher for the post i dont have his username handy and am on mobile disclaimer him nor i make any warranty on this not breaking your phone download filza file manager and mterminal in cydia if you are using appcake and you have downloaded your ipas that you own just dont install them if your apps are on a computer use ifunbox open up filza and navigate to note there are two download folders one is btdownloads and the other is it could be in either one you fill see your ipa archives you want to extract whatever one that your are going to use once youve extracted the folder go inside it and you will see another folder called payload inside this folder is the app it will be a folder named your gameapp copymove this folder into your applications folder you can use the star at the bottom of fileza to quickly get there close out of fileza and launch mterminal type uicache into mterminal and wait seconds you should be all good and can close mterminal you are probably going to run into storage problems pray that appsync and stashing are resolved soon
jailbreak,removed,u all fucking idiots im not on fucking ios im on ios and yalu works for it
jailbreak,removed,app sync allows the execution of unsigned ipa files basically to use certain apps from certain sources you need app sync to run them do some research out of the reddit to learn more as were not supposed to discuss certain tweaks and whatnot

jailbreak,removed,when you posted the album i could see what you are talking about i use placeit from the app store tons of scenes to choose from free with a watermark but they charge seemingly insane amounts for regular pictures to get past this use localiapstore and hit cancel at the apple id prompt youll get the pics emailed to you for free 😉
jailbreak,removed,just use install cutdown then install the paid version of safari downloader youll get it free
jailbreak,removed,bite your apple repo version works great for me

jailbreak,removed,if its just snapchat and spotify tweaks and you screw up and have to restore to you could look around to cracked versions of the app that you can install using a ipa file with cydia impacter you might have to reside load those applications if you reboot your phone after a week of side loading but that shouldnt effect you with snapchat or spotify since you can just sign back into both of them once you reboot i suggest looking at rsideloaded for the ipa files and how to side load the apps if you need help
jailbreak,removed,yeah after coolstars shenanigans with hidemex and other incidentsi dont think i want to get involved with an ecosystem controlled by a whiny twat like him he did this to himself
jailbreak,removed,i would recommend
jailbreak,removed,why not use a spotify or deezer tweak
jailbreak,removed,repoxaroldcom has cydown which has this feature but its also used for piracy
jailbreak,removed,man fuck off i aint here to hear your rant about how you tried everything the wrong way fucking times if u need to jailbreak u need to see past your fucking ego i just gave u an ota method too instead of trying ways youre here whining over here
jailbreak,removed,goodluck with your jb fucktard again try the ota method cydia impactor does not mean the tweak you dumb fuck saurik created a tool for windows and mac os for jbing ios which is also called imapactor and after the op post fiasco you have the balls to question my grasp over the language you retard

jailbreak,removed,no youre just a tard lol
jailbreak,removed,are you retarded
jailbreak,removed,yes if you know how to use the jailbreak youll be able to use this one you can only run the jailbreak tool once per reboot tho and you most close out of it in the app switcher also double taping the touch id sensor to activate reachability while the app is doing the jailbreak will increase your chances of the jailbreak last but not least you want to find a copy of the beta ipa not the beta because it is broken the correct size for the beta ipa is mb additionally if you trust me enough you can download it from here
jailbreak,removed,deffinetly if you need a link you can download from here if you trust me enough

jailbreak,removed,lol fuck off your not the shit i made my jailbreak for ios and i dont want to make another one so im going to use the one pangu makes for ios i know how to use google translate i figured just saying this and someone would just give me the answer i asked for and not be a complete jackass about it please excuse my language but your a bitch
jailbreak,removed,alright i didnt think i was going to have to do this i commented on one fo the noctis teasers and said that he was not going to be able to do it and i have been proven correct he says he changed the design with the designers input but the final product looks nothing like the concept and this just goes to show my initial commentary that he would not achieve the blur like the mock up showed so here we are in a beta jailbreak with the release of a very shitty fucking dollars tweak dollars for a tweak that looks nothing like the concept it was supposed to be for a tweak that needs a respring to apply the darkmode for a tweak that couldnt get the blur right what did you do just add a gray uiview overtop the blur i can barely see the contents underneath actually affecting the blur for a tweak that doesnt even color the labels white you can see where i am going here right why should anyone pay for this the developer obviously does not care about users if he knowingly releases a tweak like this as paid why did he rush to release a tweak when we are in a fucking beta jailbreak please please please dont buy this do not encourage this type of developer behaviour you may be interested in this ogygia is a free tweak that a french developer is releasing which actually does it right no respring required to apply text is actually white blur is actual real blur take a look
jailbreak,removed,post a widgets screenshot
jailbreak,removed,how can it be noctis when the text is actually white also no button in cc
jailbreak,removed,no its about the integrity of a developer releasing this as paid
jailbreak,removed,they are in denial
jailbreak,removed,and i thought it was neat no need to be a twat
jailbreak,removed,as much as your comment fucktard

jailbreak,removed,the solution is to install horizon go jailbreak tweak from a repository called insanelyi i tested the tweak and it definitely works however id recommend not installing anything else there and removing the repository immediately it also features tons of pirated apps and tweaks and i hate such repos unfortunately it is the only one to feature this tweak which appears to be the only tweak that is actually working original tweet hes refering to

jailbreak,removed,yeah i dont give two fucks about helping anymore i used to help people here as much as i could everyday the reason i dont help anymore is im sick of getting slapped in the face with fucking downvotes also you can help people and even after you solve their problem they hardly ever say thanks or give you a upvote i know its only internet points that mean nothing but for fucks sake someone helps you out then be polite and say thankyou then give the person an upvote it costs nothing and shows your greatful tldr because fuck ungreatful cunts and serial downvotersbots
jailbreak,removed,peace
jailbreak,removed,your ass dont know shit
jailbreak,removed,have you tried the tweak bday spotify remove the dashes
jailbreak,removed,theres also a tweak so you dont pay for paid tweaks loool
jailbreak,removed,most apps do this for a reason for instance they updated the api so you will need the latest version of the app you could try spoofing the app version possibly a key in a plist somewhere in the apps documents if not then you would need a tweakor flex patch to change the version and make the alert popping up
jailbreak,removed,does anyone have a mirror download
jailbreak,removed,i interpreted it as him saying that he doesnt recommend it and he just dropped the i for internet shorthand but i guess we will never know also there may not be any permanent risk but there is also no proven benefit so why advocate for the temporary risk thirdly stop being a prick when people disagree with you it makes you look really petty
jailbreak,removed,if this gets abused it goes away i know how hard this is to find so im willing to share
jailbreak,removed,butthurt low iq daft
jailbreak,removed,well the way i do it is probably not the correct way and its very tedious i delete snapchat download linkstore and scroll down through the snapchat links to find one with an old version and download it and hopefully it wont be a dead link

jailbreak,removed,this isnt for game cheats but it allows you to make ingame purchases for free in a lot of games not all but a good amount and with popular games as well it all depends if they use a host server for their payment management or do it through apple the tweak is localiapstore there is a version for ios all you do is hit cancel after selecting a purchase and you get whatever you were about to buyand again only works with certain games but there is a good library and i believe they show a list worth checking out a lot of the olderish games work with this enjoy

jailbreak,removed,fuck your downvote too just because youre too fucking lazy or stupid to differ between a b and ab some developer has to fucking release a tweak that hooks into cydia and changing its whole searching algorithm and even make functions so it does show all results no matter if there were spaces or not are you just a fucking lazy cunt or actually retarded

jailbreak,removed,retard
jailbreak,removed,get out newfag your one of those goodie shoes type of folk
jailbreak,removed,worthless if you have to sideload yalu every time worthless if you have filza or ifile worthless
jailbreak,removed,look through your post history you ask the same question just a couple of days ago stop acting like a fucking entitled little bitch and wait if you cant you can either get an android phone get a or on the right firmware or develop your own jailbreak if you arent willing to do any of the above just shut the fuck up and wait asking the same question every couple of days wont make it come faster kid
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,then you are dumb cause its working for everyone
jailbreak,removed,why use sideloaded app modifications if youre able to jailbreak im jailbreaking only because it takes less time to sideload machportal once a week and have app modifications at once instead of sideloading all modded apps
jailbreak,removed,you should learn how to speak english before acting like an asshole
jailbreak,removed,install the tvos profile
jailbreak,removed,its funny because i seem to have found your problem youre fucking asshole if you dont want to help then shut the fuck up
jailbreak,removed,first off im old enough to be your fucking dad ya bum im inexperienced ive been at this since ziphone but you were still in diapers so you wouldnt understand you clearly demonstrate that with your inability to understand not to install substrate but you went ahead and did it anyways making you part of the problem your garbage ability to accept flaws are totally expected just like your inability to read instructions for example the substrate enabler which determines you have no comprehension skills whatsoever and you again lased out like a year old at someone pointing the obvious
jailbreak,removed,boy thats a little bitchy sob story ha mommy died had to sell her house what a tissue thats right youre a loser and i really think that youre probably about to years old being that youre so judgmental and think youre so cool youre just too cool to help people youre just an asshole plain and simple maybe someday youll grow up or join mom
jailbreak,removed,i agree with you i normally wouldnt do that either except for the fact that he was being an asshole if he didnt want it used he shouldnt of mentioned that there was no point in him referring to his dead mother other than for sympathy to which i wasnt going to give him any but whatever i dont know you i dont know that asshole i dont really care god i have spent for more time talking to you and this other person about this stupidity then i have spoken to anyone about help they need or help i need on anything jailbreak related
jailbreak,removed,your dumb your question is why does mach portal close upon opening well my friend seeing how mach portal is in beta ten yes i answered your question dumb fuck
jailbreak,removed,yea i really dislike this guy as well he makes a slew of videos talking about small incremental changes wheneverjust click bait if you ask me find any reason to make a video using keyword jailbreak fuck that douchebag
jailbreak,removed,i guess you are dumb cuz its working for everyone doesnt feel good to be told that when you know what your doing does it ive been jailbreaking for over four years im not dumb i help people on this sub all the time next time maybe just shut your mouth instead of making a stupid comment
jailbreak,removed,this one worked for me

jailbreak,removed,try
jailbreak,removed,that has nothing to do with anything stop saying idiotic things that doesnt make any sense how the fuck is that a win its pure luck and as i said maybe the retards who installed the beta before even knowing there will be support now understand to wait for a stable release fuck are you drunk
jailbreak,removed,try latest filza from hyi repo
jailbreak,removed,because its not his phone dumb ass
jailbreak,removed,look little kid or fat ass that probably doesnt have a life and just sits behind a computer all day im not going to argue with you i said what i said people have already been warned its in the fucking first tread on rjailbreak we all know its a fucking beta and nobody was talking to ya lil ugly ass get a life

jailbreak,removed,from reading his recent tweets in the last hour or so he sounds like an arrogant prick to me he obviously gets great enjoyment from ridiculing people what a sad and lonely person he must be
jailbreak,removed,im not surprised hes arrogant prick
jailbreak,removed,i hate that fucking asshole so much and that everythingapplepro guy as well people should unsubscribe

jailbreak,removed,terrifying wtf man are you an apple security thing and you say its terrifying if sites take advantage some one will release a tool to clear up your phone we support and go fuck yourself
jailbreak,removed,so what we do not believe him either
jailbreak,removed,showing off a jailbreak and not releasing it is perfectly fine he dies it to show off his skills not piss you off youre not that important also you clearly dont have a fucking idea of what you are talking about or else you would know about the difference between developing a proofofconcept and the work needed to turn that into a fully functional jailbreak for endusers its his choice to not release its your choice to think hes an attention seeking dick its my choice to think youre a spoiled cunt
jailbreak,removed,hes keeping it to his own because developing a public jailbreak is lots of work and he does not want to invest all that time for a community of assholes
jailbreak,removed,the selfish brat is you hes a security researcher and not obliged to release his work for free should disney release the next star wars movie for free because they show it off in a trailer fuck you kid
jailbreak,removed,shagia first the irony of you inferring im an idiot for responding to four month old comments while you respond to mine as laughable secondly i do know where i am and i am responding to the ops original thread called i think luca todesco is a fake soab the would imply my commentsposts would be in the right place idiot true i would like to see a new jailbreak as we are where rjailbreak do you know where you are idiot i dont expect shitwell maybe a blowjob from your sister but i digress my comments were is relation to this asshole luca who runs around the internet telling everyone and anyone who will listen that he has a new jailbreak but wont share it that is just being a complete asshole something i strongly suspect you are as well if he is just into security of the ios then what the fuck he he doing helping the jailbreak community why does he tell everyone he can do something only rub it in their faces ill tell you why because he is nothing but a shit talking nerd much like yourself that needs attention that he never receives in real life simple cant be argued no one respects that type of shit no one as from me calling you an ass kisser well the simple answer isyou are you comments reek of ass kissing im not sure of your comment about luca calling people here a bunch of idiots had you read the post correctly i stated that saying you can do something that a lot of people want but wont do it is much like taunting from a grade school child try to follow along idiot you make the comment that people only want want want a jailbreak well of course they do so do you or you wouldnt be here if they could do it they would which would deflate your bro lucas ego as no one would care about him by your fuzzy logic you shouldnt live in a house because you didnt put any effort into building it yourself idiot if luca is so upset people just want and put no effort into getting it themselves which is just fucking stupid as not everyone has coding experienceknowledge then why not charge for it because hes a fake little attention whore who needs attention to validate his pathetic existence you dont see pangu or the others saying they can provide a new jailbreak but wont do you nope they bust their ass and release it to the public so many others can enjoy they do it for the challenge and let people enjoy it without asking for shit keep up that ass kissing hope it tastes good homo
jailbreak,removed,shitpost calls things everyone knows news
jailbreak,removed,im about to cop that iphone
jailbreak,removed,confirmed its words in a tweet with no proof sorry but this doesnt mean anything im not convinced of a jailbreak until we see one published but im also not sucking the cocks of people like luca and stefan who just laugh at us every time we get interested in a potential new jailbreak shitpost and title nothing proven on either side yet
jailbreak,removed,what you on about if they dont add these checks then people can get free money with localiapstore s
jailbreak,removed,i fixed this problem by just resetting my phone but my app store stopped working when i used jailbreak i dont know what caused it but whenever i tried downloading an app it would say x app is currently unavailable at this time please try again was there a way i couldve fixed it without resetting it ios iphone
jailbreak,removed,people are elitist jerks
jailbreak,removed,how would you like to suck my balls
jailbreak,removed,theclown over at insanelyi forum has it
jailbreak,removed,if its on its not jailbroken but rather sideloaded or has like buildstoreipastore if thats true than the certificate more than likely expired you should be able to use cydia impactor to sign another copy but with the standard dev account itll only last days
jailbreak,removed,people were saying this was possible fuck headand i wasnt sure so i thought id ask
jailbreak,removed,please shut the fuck up and see yourself back into rall
jailbreak,removed,when ever i download snakebite from bya it would sent me to safe mode
jailbreak,removed,its nice to have that jailbreak folder iimgurcomytddvtfjpg
jailbreak,removed,theres an app for that text grabber its a paid app try to download usinf appcake or pp store
jailbreak,removed,it should be available to download straight from the bigboss repo its weird because its kinda like icleaner in the way that its free unless you want all the features for a little extra not sure why it wont allow you to install it if it still wont let you install it you can try getting it from the ihackyouriphone repo not sure if it is a cracked version or not but i dont think so
jailbreak,removed,are you not reading responses or just dont care he has helped pangu with jailbreaks i bet youre the same type who bitches and moans about a jb being unavailable for new firmware he can show any work he likes what have you contributed or even learned about how to make a jb stupid people like you being so unbelievably entitled that youll immediately put someone down for their achievement and a main reason that there are nowhere near the number of active jailbreak developers as there used to be how can you not see your and others toxic attitude toward researchers is bringing the whole community down over time
jailbreak,removed,found it in the insanelyi repo
jailbreak,removed,i found the fix in installing the beta off insanelyi and yes i paid
jailbreak,removed,this retard can see it says install the repo then update and he is asking for help what a retard

jailbreak,removed,did you try to crack it
jailbreak,removed,does local iap store work with
jailbreak,removed,what repo
jailbreak,removed,your request should be ignored solely based on how hideous that font and color is also the fact that youre making a demand for an innocuous feature without explanation but dont have the decency to ask kindly or even include a please at the bare minimum and yet are still so obliviously full of ignorant arrogance that you find it necessary to scream while demanding a request i sincerely hope not a single person lifts a finger to help an grateful prick like you and even though i dont believe in karma may the odds be never in your favor
jailbreak,removed,lol youre the stupid one thinking that you know everything about reddit after only being on here for two months gtfo of here with that shit if you see something you dont like ignore it instead of acting like a year old and copying all the other assholes that do the same shit when they see something they dont like

jailbreak,removed,hardware carrier unlock it uses a specally modified sim trayholder
jailbreak,removed,i installed it to my ipad mini too and was only to able to install a few of the apps as well it probably works best on the latest ios or because there is some date trick referred to
jailbreak,removed,maybe is actually qwertyuiop
jailbreak,removed,should have updated to or or whole they were signed
jailbreak,removed,guys this listing is absolutely legit you can tell by scrolling further down in the

jailbreak,removed,errr there was plenty of actual proof from people like zhengmin and on weibo but i mean sure go ahead and be a lying asshole sure
jailbreak,removed,dont use iapcrazy it will make your device have ads instead use localiapstore it works better and accomplishes the same thing

jailbreak,removed,you signed your name on a document that states you are aware of potential data loss if your battery is not consumed why would you expect a brand new phone just because you assume the battery will continue trending the way it does not mean it is a defective battery making unauthorized modifications at any point in time is grounds for denying service thats what you sign up for even if the phone had never been jailbroken neither a defective battery nor a defective home button warrants replacing the phone you would get a battery repair and a display repair you dont just get to demand a new phone jailbreaking not only means youre on an unstable version of ios but it means youve been running unauthorized software which can affect your battery capacity as well as a home button with touch id most likely you didnt even speak with a genius they primarily take care of macs why the fuck would an apple technician allow a customer to leave the store with a replacement device running an unstable version of software immediately after fixing their issue god youre the most ignorant fuck ive read on the subreddit

jailbreak,removed,sure give me a minute however i wonder if the files from iphone se will work for you
jailbreak,removed,use appdb kodi standard installs fine
jailbreak,removed,anyways here you are
jailbreak,removed,you can simply download another version of the app on your computer using cracked websites not gonna name them here though then use cydia impactor to install them
jailbreak,removed,appcake its a free app anyway so your not ripping any devs off by using this option
jailbreak,removed,ds emulator inds is the best
jailbreak,removed,you need clutch to decrypt apps its a while since ive been jailbroken maybe there is a better solution
jailbreak,removed,either app admin or appcake with appsync unified
jailbreak,removed,u may use cydown from xarolds repo but that tweak is also used for piracy so take care but u can downgrade the tweak with it pls remember i do not support piracy and this is not an ad for piracy

jailbreak,removed,check your internet connection if you can access the internet just remove the corresponding sources from cydia add them back one at a time refreshing as you go maybe this will help good luck keep pirating everyone does it
jailbreak,removed,cant wait for it to get cracked
jailbreak,removed,remindme day
jailbreak,removed,remindme days what did you learn
jailbreak,removed,mi friend here are the mhb rules all credits are for the author of the mhb tweak
jailbreak,removed,yeah he wont stop spamming take his dick out your mouth and follow him on twitter so he can release his jb all he wants is followers
jailbreak,removed,you talk like a fucking moron but i appreciate you being helpful
jailbreak,removed,i am not sure i made that comment as sort of a joke i would assume you would need appsync as i was thinking you would sideload it using something like appcake or something sorry for confusion
jailbreak,removed,pmed you
jailbreak,removed,since youre the only one who cared ill give you a little update unfortunately i cant finish it tonight having this really really frustrating bug where it takes two resprings instead of one to apply certain changes and i cant figure it out rn ive been working on this for too long tho so im gunna sleep and take a fresh crack at it in the morning heres a deb if you wanna try it hope i dont need to say you should be on ios simply enable the tweak in settings under settingscamera and it should show only a camera glyph the other custom buttons are broken atm in prefs so all you need to worry about is the switch on top let me know how it goes for you
jailbreak,removed,that sucks thanks for the help and screw the ones who downvoted for no reason you guys are assholes
jailbreak,removed,id rahther sty unjailbroken than use any tool rom an asshole
jailbreak,removed,first download the snapchatsigninipa app link you may have to close out of a few pop up ads before they let you download next download snapchatipa app link and then finally get the latest version of cydia impactor for your operating system link now after downloading the three tools youll need for the hacked snapchat open cydia impactor have your device phone connected via usb to computer drag the snapchatsigninipa to cydia impactor it will ask you to sign in to your itunes account do so now head over to your iphone you will need to trust the developer before you can open the app to trust the apple id developer go to settings general profiles and find your profile trust it now open snapchat and login after logging in close the app and make sure it is not running in background now go back to your computer and drag the cracked snapchatipa to cydia impactor it will install the app to your device and once its complete go to your iphone now open snapchat app and it should work it is working perfectly on my iphone ios
jailbreak,removed,first
jailbreak,removed,holy shit man youve gone full retard you ever see tropic thunder you never go full retard
jailbreak,removed,if the majority of this community are dicks and kids then why are you being upvoted as well as this post maybe ive missed somthing i honestly dont frequently this sub everyday but i havnt noticed anyone bitching about the wait for the jailbreak i think most people on here are pretty chill and just want to jailbreak their phones but maybe im wrong
jailbreak,removed,update to problem solved
jailbreak,removed,yeah i know but fuck it im tired of waiting on this guy the jailbreak is fine for me like i knew all that going in thanks lol

jailbreak,removed,just use another app store like appcake if they decide to be asshats lol there are always ways around it
jailbreak,removed,fuck off mate
jailbreak,removed,try this no spam
jailbreak,removed,i think where we can agree is that its not exactly him personally making it an issue here and in fact hes perfectly welcome to tout whatever personal breakthroughs make him happy on other forums im just tired of this sub being packed with a bunch of useless posts about it especially when the rules are so sickeningly strict about blocking things that do belong here like tweak updates and posts from developers who are creating tweaks and helping keep the community thriving
jailbreak,removed,you didnt properly read his tweet did you he didnt say i can jailbreak but i wont for two days he said i want to jailbreak but i cant for two days because of his shitty bandwidth i know the feeling myself having to deal with satellite internet im not defending a troll post im defending reality the whole screw this guy because he can jailbreak and wont give it to us and then posts about it to piss us off mentality is so fucking stupid even if he is trolling hes doing so because of this community trust me if i could do what luca does i would probably do the exact same thing in fact i would do it worse i would specifically taunt people and say stuff like i can make jailbreaks and you suckers cant haha because there are some real motherfuckers on this sub who really think theyre entitled to every single jailbreak achieved ever and theyre not nobody is
jailbreak,removed,holy click bait especially for those that dont know who qwertyoruio is and the fact that yes he is able to jailbreak his personal device very quickly but doesnt actually release jailbreak tools fuck you to whoever wrote this post title i can only imagine how many ifttt triggers were tripped because of this shitty misleading post title
jailbreak,removed,basically if ios changed the file at all it wont work so of them wont work standalone tweaks might work think appaddict emulators etc but those are rare

jailbreak,removed,i dont know if the game changed on ios but basically if have a jailbreak you install a whatspad tweak from cydia then you can connect your icloud account to itunes download the original whatsapp it wont say no find where windows keep the ipa most probably in musicitunesapplication close itunes and connect you device install the with ifunbox or even copy it to your ipad and install it by ifilefilzaterminal or import it on appcake take care of root permissions of you used openssh as a root in transferring so is ios any different
jailbreak,removed,same but for another reason if you dont wanna risk it use appcake

jailbreak,removed,this should be top i totally agree the dude is young publicly stated on the download page that its completely fucked and only for devs said he was offering it anyway as needed a hand as expected droves of uninformed dickheads installed it anyway and then shat on him for weeks after when nothing had changed here we are months later or whatever it is and countless cocks like op are still making posts along the lines of what the fuck is up with this guy i just dont get it i went to for apple watch and its not really that horrible ive been more or less jailbroken since iphone so ive seen a lot of change and stock ios isnt exactly half bad anymore if a jailbreak is do or die then maybe iphone isnt for those people anymore whiners gotta whine though i guess i personally think the guy has immense talent and patience and thank him for everything so far and i dont hold it against him if he just wants to vanish and get shitfaced every weekend instead like a normal year old

jailbreak,removed,youre a horrible person nuff said
jailbreak,removed,so some butthead removed the thread hi many of you know about the noctis and ogygia tweaks i found out recently that andrew wiik developer for ioscreatix created a new profile and identity sadie kane and carter kane and created a tweak called ogygia which looks very similar to noctis by laughingquoll in the upcoming post from andrew sadie created a story about a false identity which claimed that she was a developer new to the scene and was not good at english so he then created carter to act as translator i find this disgusting that andrew wiik a respected developer in the community created such a story to show a tweak that everyone can see copied noctis because noctis was shown weeks prior and used the concepts by appleidesigner which were created months ago the identity was most likely created to gain attention due to it being a female and we all know that not many developers are female he went to so much effort to create this account even going to the effort of installing apps that only a girl would have and defending the account with comments when it was found that the name was suspiciously similar to characters from a book what he has done is very low he should be ashamed of his actions but he seems to just want to bag laughingquolls noctis he created the identity and started making the tweak just to downput noctis thats just my view on the situation proof saved incase deleted andrew wiik now openly sadie cane the false reddit account and the post people deserve to know the truth

jailbreak,removed,no they dont anyways i just restored and downloaded all my tweaks again and my phone is fast af also i find it funny how you hate on piracy yet you probably pirate tweaks as well just like more than of the jb community theres no need to downvote every post i make lmfao pathetic year old

jailbreak,removed,update your snapchat to the newest version you can downgrade later using appadmin download nosub from cydia enable nosub for snapchat and dont forget to respring you should be able to log in now download a screen recorder it continues to work even with nosub enabled for snapchat i use display recorder from the bya repo save the video and screenshot the pictures you want from the video hope this helps
jailbreak,removed,maybe iapcrazy thats what mine was just use localiapstore
jailbreak,removed,is it possible to crack imessage stickers or apps
jailbreak,removed,this is the most relevant sub moron
jailbreak,removed,or bust
jailbreak,removed,im afraid you appear to be mistaken you cannot fake a hash of a file to back this up ive done yet another check against the snapchat binary provided by yourself and the fresh one i downloaded from appaddict yours is on the left httpimgurcomaohbps the hashes are identical the binary has not been modified whatsoever with your screenshot it looks like youve simply changed the permission of the file to write only for world and the file i have here is also exactly bytes in size to prove the file you have is different please post the of it alongside the binary itself for others to confirm that it is indeed different on your end furthermore i never said that it was a joke simply that from my investigation that it couldnt work i believe i have gathered enough information to prove my position and in fact i wouldnt take said position without anything concrete
jailbreak,removed,i honestly think it wasnt a problem these kids are being whiny pussies
jailbreak,removed,in this is not metahhhhh you are so stupid go kill yourself shitposts
jailbreak,removed,thanks you are right i am just needing to be able to use hangouts in particular i was able to downgrade to a working version of hangouts using appcake but after a couple weeks got the pop up on the hangouts app itself directing me to the app store to upgrade again unfortunately app admin requires and i am wanting to stay on to keep my untethered jailbreak
jailbreak,removed,in that first picture it looks like its installing substrate and what not but you should only need to remove that package
jailbreak,removed,i have not tried it with phantom or snap to install a certain version of snapchat you need to use appcake or another party application installer its like installous back in the day you must also use appsync or another tweak that alows you to use unofficial applications
jailbreak,removed,hack my iphone they pirate them i think

jailbreak,removed,fuck off
jailbreak,removed,fuck tihmstar
jailbreak,removed,you all are a bunch of entitled whiny brats jesus fucking christ its a fucking phone relax
jailbreak,removed,these devs do this work and we benefit from their time and even though effort without hardly giving back except kind words from some and horrible ones from many the amount of bullshit him and luca have put up with is astronomical and the very reason many people stop working on jailbreaks and other tools this sums it up extremely well and the worst part is the hate gets through a lot more to these guys than the love and appreciation there has to be just as many that appreciate what they do for us as there are ignorant dickbags i get it and would be irritated myself its just a shame that there are those that truly dont care what they say to someone via a computer im just glad there are options to block pretty much whoever now a days i want to say i read a luca tweet stating he had to block something like in one day yikes man really sorry its come to this uqwertyoruiop because you guys definitely do not deserve any of it

jailbreak,removed,here an ipa with fixed defplist try it out
jailbreak,removed,hijacking this top post for my important message here an ipa with fixed defplist for iphone se with tsmc chip copy it with cydia impactor to your iphone se
jailbreak,removed,so my title is self explanatory but how it happened is a mystery to me i use the tongbu windows app to store my backups and i noticed it put an app on my phone and its been there a while and i never opened it so i opened it and it showed a fix symbol like in the windows app so i plugged it into my laptop and clicked that icon and it wiped out my whole first page almost and deleted select apps out of my other pages as well it removed substrate fix but it is still installed under my packages in cydia icleaner one of my banking apps and something else i cant put my finger on but my main problem i feel can be fixed if i can restore a backup to get all my stock apps back and to keep jailbreak but i cant because find my iphone is on in the settings app any ideas on how i can reinstall settings
jailbreak,removed,is there a chance you could stop feeling hard from being a jackass on the internet i asked about future jailbreak support asshole im clearly aware that it isnt currently supported
jailbreak,removed,basically this implies to any ipa that is sideloaded with cydia impactoror xcode since you are a free user apple lets you sign an app only for days having said so you sideload yalu ipa via cydia impactor this needs to be signed every week
jailbreak,removed,remindme
jailbreak,removed,holy fucking shit it worked first time cydia installed used altered ipa from post
jailbreak,removed,you can try this repo it works for some and not for others including me so use at your own risk it just sends me to safe mode
jailbreak,removed,oh fuck off youre cool we get it
jailbreak,removed,and you are a faggot mate hope my jailbreaking tutorial fucks your phone up

jailbreak,removed,please downvote my comment
jailbreak,removed,fuck off
jailbreak,removed,youre a special kind of douchebag
jailbreak,removed,remember that time he dropped a working on twitter fuck off
jailbreak,removed,fuck off
jailbreak,removed,its a space issue what i did was i downloaded appsync unified and downloaded the ipa a google search for a kodi ipa will do you good and i signed the app with ifunbox
jailbreak,removed,luca is a piece of shit whether hes fake most likely or not to constantly post that hes found exploits that will work but not release any is just being a little piece of shit attention whore like his mother if he doesnt want to help the jailbreak scene then shut the fuck up seek attention elsewhere luca is a little pussy of a man who isnt anything but a piece of shit in real life and he knows it he seeks to validate himself with all his posts rubbing a jailbreak in peoples faces were all glad you have a jailbreak and are soooooo super impressed luca wow youre the best happy now has your weak ego been feed enough to get you to your next phony ass post too bad you dont have anything else or a girlfriend you fucking nerd the rest of you ass kissing little girls make me sick you think by sucking his dick on forums is going to somehow make this faggot release his jailbreak if he even has one get a fucking grip ass kissers trust me someone else will release a jailbreak soon and his ego will go back to normal which isnt jack shit hell be back to mommys basement stroking his little cock to babysitter porn his fat stubby sweaty fingers staining his cock with cheetos remnants wishing he actually could fuck a real girl

jailbreak,removed,fucking fight me httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubot
jailbreak,removed,thanks for the info how am i meant to open it like a zip file i have ifile and its a ipa allowing options such as for it to be opened in appcake etc
jailbreak,removed,so hypothetically you can get free games similar to appcake on cydia right how about in the us
jailbreak,removed,not just that this guy is a functional retard imo
jailbreak,removed,and never forget
jailbreak,removed,install it from insanelyi repo
jailbreak,removed,shit release for cricket and id marry you
jailbreak,removed,if someone with a device could clutch the app i can take a look
jailbreak,removed,if you mean in the top right corner then your right and i sincerely apologize totally forgot about that wheel
jailbreak,removed,youre the only one being an asshole here bud
jailbreak,removed,not sure if im allowed to post this but here is the old deb
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,anyone its important to know because we easy can change the things they check and update the app i am sure it is possible because after every snapchat update on appcake there is cracked ones which are cracked and they work for a day for example which means cracked ones works until they bann them so does anyone knows what they check and what they actually bann i have tried a simple thing t change the version in the info config file and if is an older version shows that is not supported and its an old ver if its ver close the the latest one then the issue is the connectioninternetcant login so there is a way
jailbreak,removed,lol that escalated quickly and theres a big difference between stealing tweaks which are usually made by one person or a small team of people that use the money to help them get through college and stealing the unlimited data that a multibillion dollar company gives me anyway this is petty bullshit youre a fucking idiot
jailbreak,removed,because its not certified for your device retard
jailbreak,removed,this is why i buy tweaks only from known good developers but from a developer that i never bought yet i buy it and then download a pirated version as those run better than the original one tldr if you tweak has drm i pirate it if it does not have drm then i buy and use the original version
jailbreak,removed,localiapstore could not find info about this tweaktheme bleep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot

jailbreak,removed,because both saurik and cydia suck balls
jailbreak,removed,phantom is known to be a little trouble so download snapchat from any website thatll give it out appdb preferably delete phantom and snapchat and download appsync unified from cydia go to appdbcc and link your device and install the profile go here to install the modded snapchat app scroll down and download it there 😊
jailbreak,removed,did you read the technical write up fucking ignorant dumbasses speaking parroting shit they heard but never bother to fucking investigate in the simplest terms here is simply reading the fucking technical write up
jailbreak,removed,added your repo and it tells me theres an update for phantom i read the notes for it from your repo and its a pirated version to get the pro version for free asshole

jailbreak,removed,the exploits have been in use since ios why do you suddenly care you didnt care for the last years why start now not knowing is the same as not caring are you that important you need to keep your secrets fully tucked away no your not how do i know this simple youre jailbroken if you cared for security you wouldnt be jailbroken so how about we all just stfu about this latest hack and move on nobody cares whats on your phone your not a government target youre not important if you were you wouldnt be here
jailbreak,removed,gawd why are people dumb as fuck sorry okay dont download pp tool it has a infinite certificate but it will search to see if its been revoked every so often without u knowing and its in chinese delete which ever tool u have in ur iphone even if its cydia impacted now close all apps from the background and download cydia impacter and then the itunes file open cydia impacter and plug ur phone in then once it says ur name drag n drop the i tunes file on it put your apple id in its safe u can sue apple if something happensthen it should download the tool to ur phone now once its done downloading like a regular app disconnect ur iphone from the computer then go to setting device managementprofile and trust the app it should say r email now go into the app u downloaded onto ur iphone open it now check mark the year certificate then press jailbreak and wait secs before clicking the power off button to go tot the home screen then press and wait until it reboots bawm

jailbreak,removed,thanks to uantikerta for uploading the deb for iconsupport which allows you to install it on
jailbreak,removed,i prefer and as its open source i decided to update it to ios i havent got a device to test it with on ios at the moment but it works perfectly on ios now with ipad air iphone im not sure how other devices will work i know ios does not work but then you should use the official version up to you if you want to test it
jailbreak,removed,youre fucking stupid

jailbreak,removed,no jailbrwak but you can get ipa store and install lodi pocpcorn time among others i would never get a fire stick its crap go for the apple tv and get ipad store you wont regret it
jailbreak,removed,lol idk if youre a troll or just retarded but no where did that say it was released today isnt even out yet the site said it was rumoured the beta would be released today but it wasnt nice true though i guess
jailbreak,removed,its not even about coming clean or owning up to your mistakes we all know you meant well youre just an idiot and people shouldnt have put trust in you youre tweaks are basically six lines of codes unstable unnecessary and overall youve caused far more harm than good i think its best to just walk away at this point
jailbreak,removed,snapchat is the worse app ever only little kids and pedos use this to dev of this op haters gon hate you are a coder which automatically gives you intelligence over these poor sorry drones remember these kids and pedos dont know how to code and possibly dont have a job therefore they dont know what hard work is like you do keep up the honesty and the hard work
jailbreak,removed,yea i wanted to play youtubers life from the app store and dont see it as being a game worth bucks was gonna use ifunbox and install it onto phone but i read that i needed appsync for any games installed with ifunbox to work i tried installing the game on ifunbox before installing appsync and the game was not on my phone thats when i took the plunge and installed appsync
jailbreak,removed,ive always enjoyed your tweaks and i know it takes a lot to come out and admit you fucked up on these tweaks and apologize like you did here props to you for the post and im very much looking forward to your upcoming tweaks also just ignore the cunts commenting here saying things like you should just quit and get out now they never contributed anything to this community like you have and really need to be slapped upside the head for saying something like that its people like that bring out the worst of this sub which is otherwise an awesome great place its too bad we diddnt have a way to have people vote or give ratings on other sub members so we could just filter out douches who say shit like that so we dont have to see any of there comments or posts
jailbreak,removed,the least you can do is thank me for trying you didnt mention no file sharing in the post now were all trying to help like idiots anyway i think your last choice is to backup your phone through itunes and extract the using a backup extractor like ibackupbot then go fuck yourself
jailbreak,removed,install the latest version of appsync
jailbreak,removed,i decided i didnt want to wait forever for this so bought a pxn speedy which is mfi compatible and pretty close to an original controller
jailbreak,removed,luca is a lazy cunt wont release shit for the and in the end
jailbreak,removed,i hade the same problem on my iphone plus ios so try to this step launch cydia and install apple file conduit onto your device step download ifunbox on your computer step connect your iphone ipad or ipod touch to your computer via a usb cable and open ifunbox step from the left sidebar open raw file system step on the right where your devices files and folders are displayed find and rename cydianostash to cydianostash step disconnect your device from the computer launch cydia and it should start preparing the file system after its done you should be able to install packages and tweaks without any problem
jailbreak,removed,dont
jailbreak,removed,well goddamnit fuck that kid
jailbreak,removed,well if he just has an iphone go for it now a person like me that has iphones ipads in the house macbook pros imac and a time capsule fire stick is shit i have apple music if i want to listen to it on any tv in my house its there if im in the living room and my daughter is in the room and the tv goes off i can be in the kitchen and tell the siri remote to put it back on for her yes it works at that distance if any friends come over its simple they can easily airplay anything to the tv or mirror the screen also once you have ipa store you can install safari for on screen browsing if you have loads of apple products go for the apple tv it is more advanced period yes it isnt jail broken but all you need to get on it is kodi for get the pay direct tv now for months and get it free then cancel and just use kodi live tv plugins plastic black remote with cheap plastic flimsy buttons go pick up a siri remote and start making comparisons
jailbreak,removed,its telling you to fuck off and listen to luca
jailbreak,removed,ok
jailbreak,removed,okay
jailbreak,removed,im sure you can google an ipa file if twitch ever supported ios you can probably download it from a third party website which may or may not be legal for you to do if twitch was never coded to run on ios you are out of luck update the tablet or simply do without
jailbreak,removed,jelbrek please eta son
jailbreak,removed,i sill dont give a fuck
jailbreak,removed,add this repo and install it
jailbreak,removed,try comhackyouriphoneorg it has some pirated apps which is bad but wink is there and seeing as its normally free i dont see why you shouldnt download it
jailbreak,removed,if i did correctly this should work
jailbreak,removed,theres a modded version going around you can use that but he warned its known to break substrate
jailbreak,removed,says the retard himself
jailbreak,removed,this one worked to me for whatever reason i get an error when i click on the download button but if i do a force touch on the download button itll ask if i want to open in ifile click that and then click on installer and it will install
jailbreak,removed,here
jailbreak,removed,no you fucking snake you lie and lie fucking worthless get out of this sub
jailbreak,removed,with conflicting data
jailbreak,removed,i sure regret not getting that condecdending assholes help
jailbreak,removed,shut up
jailbreak,removed,and thats why those piracy apps like appcake are there for a reason
jailbreak,removed,fuck off with your cracked repos and pay for what you want when they stop signing they need to make a cracked repo that will fuck your phone up so all the people that want to jailbreak but not pay for the tweaks they want automatically get moved to without jb
jailbreak,removed,how about you pay for your apps and not steal them you stupid cunt
jailbreak,removed,just so you know were not really a huge fan of piracy around here sure lots of us do it but were not gonna go out of our way to help other people developers need to get paid if developers dont get paid we wind up with a issue like bite sms they cant make enough money to survive and one of the greatest tweaks ever dies you can block the ads using a firewall or using a few other tweaks but youre gonna have to pay for those just to crack phantom
jailbreak,removed,do a google search literally the first result solves your problem remove this post
jailbreak,removed,i will still use the cracks to try them out saurik pays every transaction
jailbreak,removed,nothing significant was said in this article in other words rshitpost

jailbreak,removed,ive been having the same issue all day today i assume its because a bunch of people me included all got motivated to try and jailbreak before the signing window for closed
jailbreak,removed,well i thought he might know a solution not saying this has something to do with him thanks for being an asshole
jailbreak,removed,youre telling me you dont want mario bricks on your keyboard fag s have you got bytafont installed
jailbreak,removed,appcake because i pirate a lot it can also download torrents but then i would need filza to manage the files
jailbreak,removed,i know that asshole i was trying to get more clarification on the issue if its such a bother to you dont fucking comment next time
jailbreak,removed,would you mind reuploading it to someplace like meganz
jailbreak,removed,no its localiapstore ipa is the file you install on your phone got apps iap is in app purchase meant for hack in app purchases
jailbreak,removed,i personally dont play that game but if its single player you can try localiapstore if its multiplayer i think that your out of luck
jailbreak,removed,hopefully it gets removed it seems out of place here and most of the humor threads are teens talking about snapchat nudes
jailbreak,removed,had this when i updated the tweak i dloaded from bya to ver so i deleted the tweak and install ver from insanelyi and it worked like before
jailbreak,removed,thanks so much for the reply i really wish there was a viable tweak to disable the audio of an app but this solution works great one extra thing though for anyone having trouble getting filza to work i bought it but for some reason it wasnt activating properly when i wasnt connected to wifi go here insanelyi dot there is a deb file there you can install from ifile great solution thank you
jailbreak,removed,just use the one from xarold i know its pirated but im sure you can make an exception
jailbreak,removed,humor is a very personal thing something i find funny you might think is stupid as fuck instead of shitting all over the post and down voting it reddit hell so that no one else sees it just move on this sub is like a bunch of fucking pussies who get butt hurt if every post doesnt meet their criteria of what they think is funny or important
jailbreak,removed,you can use cydown and flex to unlock tweaks for free on cydia download mywitether me pda net to make your iphone a hotspot for your android phone assuming you have unlimited data matter of fact im using tether me to use my laptop to type this comment you can basically just use your iphone to activate your android phone anywhere as long as your iphone is nearon you you can look up the repos needed for tetherme or the others or you could buy it via cydia store using paypal or amazon tether me is and works great i personally like mywi more for more demanding times like using my phone to power my for and there is no lag for me as long as its usb connected

jailbreak,removed,i know exactly what im talking about and was referring to pimskeks when talking about the dev who by the way deserves to be paid whether the cheap pricks and entitled crybabies bought the original years ago or not when you buy a tweak you are buying it for the ios version it was purchased on you are not entitled to free lifetime updates to future firmwares people like you with that attitude are to thank for many great devs walking away from this community they can have my dollar and not only will i not shed a tear im happy to give it
jailbreak,removed,you have no chill and clearly need to fuck off

jailbreak,removed,unfortunately i have to underline the facts even though you and pimseks are not the original developers of auki auki did not receive one update from the end of onward auki was released at the end of ios s life cycle the developers of auki did not return of my emails i sent them over the last year and a half while pimseks might be a seasoned completely new developer it shows bad judgement to takeover a tweak without communicating to the public any disdain for previous update cycles in other words wtf yea no not falling for it this time not at not at i will pirate the tweak i will encourage others to do the same
jailbreak,removed,i once had the soundcloud ipa for ios but about a year or two ago it stopped working i think soundcloud blocks it now heres the ipa since i dont have a device on ios to test it

jailbreak,removed,sorry what i meant is a while back someone created a program called bettersemirestore and said it was better than semirestore because it worked on the device rather than an app on a computer but i heard bettersemirestore didnt work safely compared to coolstars semirestore but that might not be what yall were talking about and just meant semirestore

jailbreak,removed,appcake has older versions and even pulled apps it used to be a better scene back in the day when it was installous but its the best i know of now you need appsync installed with this to work
jailbreak,removed,httpsyoutubejozjutkthkw showing the options on of what works and what doesnt work basically whatever apps you have in a folder you can lock that folder and no one without the the password can access that folder however locking individual apps outside of folders does not work and those apps can be deleted even if you chose to lock them with a password in this version of applocker in closing you want to protectlock apps from being deleted put those apps in a folder and password protect it in applocker
jailbreak,removed,a jailbroken ios is very vulnerable too especially if the user doesnt know what he is doing openssh with default mobileroot users alpine password fucked install cracked appstweaks from appcakeunknown cydia sources potentially fucked letting some developers log into your device to fix the jailbreak issues of ios ahh come on

jailbreak,removed,im not making an argument im stating the fking obvious next time you try to make a valid argument since you got a step up on me from your shitty pov try not to invalidate your claims by stopping to my level of idiocy and calling names god correlation you can ponder on this this whole fking situation is no different than jaimbreak a friends phone said friend does what he wants installing tweaks crashes phone but blame hoes to the person who actually jailbroke it yea thats common sense at its finest piss off
jailbreak,removed,idiots
jailbreak,removed,if youre using this tweak from a source that is not the original one thats the most likely reason why it wont work not all sources updated this tweak but i know for sure that the one from hackyouriphone is fully working try that and let me know what happens

jailbreak,removed,dont be that faggot
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,watchnotifications
jailbreak,removed,there are few more steps to follow when youre going to jailbreak ios i recommend you to use a new apple id and password for ios jailbreak with pangu you have to know that pangu jailbraek is only valid for a seven days and you have to rejailbreak your device in every week not to worry because now it is possibe to get oneyear developer enterprise certificate for ios jailbreak with free of chargehttpcydiadownloadcom and you have to pay if youre going to buy developer enterprise cetificate
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,fuck you nigger whore
jailbreak,removed,no this is me being prejudicial this is me saying you all are fucking idiots to blindly trust
jailbreak,removed,yep i gave a well thought out argument that was not rude or prejudicial or opinion laden bullshit you should see some of the horrible responses ive gotten this place is a joke its a bunch of teenagers
jailbreak,removed,i see no names have come forward big surprise you want to know whats ruining the scene you fuckers little kids expecting and demanding a jailbreaking little entitled bastards who want everything its an absolute joke jailbreaking used to be serious now all people want is to secretly download their girlfriends snap chat bypass spotify restrictions and cheat at pokemon
jailbreak,removed,has anyone been able to find the ipa file for v of pokemon go i need this file does anyone have this or a link to an actual working file download i believe that is the last version before
jailbreak,removed,not mine but i searched for this same thing a few hours ago another reddit user posted it and it works need anemone to use it
jailbreak,removed,i wonder how you are capable of dressing yourself in the morning selfish ignorant and simply unnecessary
jailbreak,removed,well you can crack it for now and buy it later thats what i did to test to see if it works
jailbreak,removed,go to hell

jailbreak,removed,the tweak is called keywi i think it exist i use ios emojis from the hackyouriphone video
jailbreak,removed,remindme weeks
jailbreak,removed,basically youre fucking stupid who comes to the idea of deleting the cydia app moron sorry but someone had to say it
jailbreak,removed,you dont know what the world flirtatious means it doesnt mean thirsty shut the fuck up you you disgusting perverted troll
jailbreak,removed,i believe if you use appcake you can download older editions of snapchat
jailbreak,removed,i can confirm that nosub worked for me you can get it in the hackyouriphone repo
jailbreak,removed,this is karma for all those cunts who whine about him never releasing
jailbreak,removed,do you have an unmodified ipa of snapchat if so can you extract it and compare it with the modified ipa hes uploaded on his page ive just had a quick browse and all files have edit dates of and of december he uploaded this file hours ago and as fair as i can see none of the december edits are his unless he was eg playing around with the russian language folders in fact this is even more hilarious theres a zip comment in the ipa from telefonbuch on with rasticrac lol my modified snapchat hahaha like i said this developer isnt a developer at all theres no proof sac works what a shambles
jailbreak,removed,fuck off
jailbreak,removed,i must say this has gotten me to break out from essay mode and check this out from what i can gather from the files moved into place by the postinst script of the deb these do serve to block some connections to send data on but is done by simply changing a config file this can easily be ignored in the binary of the snapchat app the claim of checking for dylibs loaded through the sac package itself doesnt appear to be true right now im loading up the snapchat binary posted in the latest post into hopper interestingly it appears to be grabbed from appaddict and is actually a cracked app from telefonbuch will do a comparison of what i assume to be the original and the provided binary to see whats different
jailbreak,removed,remindme in days
jailbreak,removed,fuck everyone bunch of assholes who jack off to anime porn
jailbreak,removed,can someone please mirror the snapchat ipa someplace else
jailbreak,removed,can you upload a mirror the link for the patched ipa is down

jailbreak,removed,what this dick was thinking while writing the above ill talk about how old i think he is because i am ill talk abt an issue in this sub reddit and get away with being a dick i am the reason tweakwiz left and the rest stayed and you laughed using an emoji in your comment you havent even hit puberty yet sigh and no dev would leave if i called a snobby lil piece of shit a snobby lil piece of shit like that is stupidjust like your thoughts above dont expect me to respond again but dont worry youre allowed to write all you want peace you snobby lil piece of shit

jailbreak,removed,piss off
jailbreak,removed,off topic piss off
jailbreak,removed,so they didnt publicly release it but they are replying to emails with the jailbreak attached webmastergsmagicnet oh and they will probably get a lot of emails to that one inbox so make sure you use their personal one make sure you ask for christos tzeremes hurry and email them in the reply they said they would only give out of them
jailbreak,removed,my defense this isnt a fight the fact that you feel high and mighty because youre a dev and cant possibly allow someone newinexperienced to try something is precisely my point did you offer help no did you try to explain no you and people like you just shat on him and called him fake hes not fake for not knowing hes trying and learning its pathetic this makes you feel proud but honestly i dont even care man im over jailbreaking precisely because of shit like this you circle jerk assclowns deserve each other and the bullshit on this forum no amount of customization is worth where this subbed it has gone the last two years disgusting
jailbreak,removed,he said i know this is the is the sub for jail broken devices but i dont want to jailbreak my device translation i know im off topic but fuck you im asking anyway because i cant use google fuck off
jailbreak,removed,it has no dents scratches cracks so its in mint condition if you dont feel comfortable doing it peer to peer i can put it up on swappa and you can buy it from there so its under swappa staff watch price is negotiable and i can ship sameday for free with priority mail with tracking and require signature let me know if you have any questionsconcerns
jailbreak,removed,attention whes
jailbreak,removed,logic is unwelcome in this sub didnt you know circlejerk or gtfo
jailbreak,removed,

jailbreak,removed,you thought the guy was trying to stay anonymous so youd be the asshole that blows up his spot sweet dickmove
jailbreak,removed,we have a post up about this topic check it out
jailbreak,removed,gfym
jailbreak,removed,how about decoding the data which is being received from the apple server by isolating it disenabling internet for everything but itunes that way the received packets of data contain the apple signature which we can fake by rerouting the server to our own private server like localiapstore works and showing it to be an update this probably wouldnt work if you have the latest version installed unless you try restore if im wrong it will be because i have next to no programming knowledge and please do help me fill the gap in the knowledge by replying what is correct i assume that it hasnt been done because of the encryption which is hard to crack im just saying if we just duplicate the whole thing without decrypting the stuff it can technically work possibly
jailbreak,removed,hi

jailbreak,removed,i even went as far as to remove and then re add the source i think i found the problem though the appcake repo seems to somehow be pulling appsync unified from karens repo its very odd

jailbreak,removed,luca is a fake man
jailbreak,removed,this is one reason i like cydown for it caches deb files in cydia so whenever i have a problem like this i just reinstall the cydia installer deb and substrate and it fixes the issue but if you dont have cydown or another tweak that adds the same function you cant reinstall substrate or cydia installer
jailbreak,removed,well luca is a joke in himself hes not done anything prominent for this community hes such a smug piece of shit remember when he couldnt get his jailbreak to work and then had the audacity to say he wanted to move to other ios versions and still just wants to be a stefan esser lol what a joke hope he gets hit by a bus
jailbreak,removed,exactly people are dumb here
jailbreak,removed,you could make a custom ipsw but i dont know if keys are released for ipod which is rocking an cpufurthermore custom ipsw could bypass it because its and ipodsearch on yt for he makes custom ipsw you may find a workaround
jailbreak,removed,yes it has the app can only be installed through appcake and needs the device to be jailbroken
jailbreak,removed,same problem to me cydiawhatspad installing newer versions of whatsapp by using appcake is not the problemthe problem is the detection by whatsapp of using an ipad instead of iphone maybe the cydia app anywhere could be a solution fakeing the usage of iphone
jailbreak,removed,this is also allowed by the moderators despite the rules 😄
jailbreak,removed,if you are taking about getting music free see rule no piracy
jailbreak,removed,shit nigga
jailbreak,removed,theres a tweak where you can just get all the in app purchases for free on most games pretty cool local iap store i believe
jailbreak,removed,jesus dude whats your problem go back and reread your first comment it was condescending and called out downvotes as a way of proving yourself right classic fallacy noticing that i made a joke about being bitter hardly making a big deal out of it and then went on to respond to your question which is more respect than any person who downvotes and moves on gave you discussion is value creation basically though fuck off
jailbreak,removed,look at the guys posts he has made he seems like a asshole
jailbreak,removed,it is working with me just fine do you mean last whatsapp update if that the case downgrade it from appcake or do you mean whatspad update probably not
jailbreak,removed,please god tell me youre trolling because otherwise youre just a fucking asshole lets break this down well at the moment its pretty obviously you but aside from that im good hahaha clever you sure proved him wrong on that whole condescending prick thing honestly you overreacted to something i saidstill are by the way how is he overreacting to anything his first comment said words his second one was a sentence and a joke his third post was calling you out for being an asshole you also have nothing of value to add to this conversation thats ironic coming from you youve said and contributed nothing to anything here im not sure why you think that you can butt in add nothing of value not actually dispute my original point in the first place and then tell me to fuck off he didnt butt in you posted a comment in a discussion forum your first comment had some snark so he made a joke and then gave you a genuine answer to the question you proposed why is a post about an ios beta relevant to jailbreaking the reason he told you to fuck off is because you came at him after he put effort into trying to have an actual discussion with your stupid ass nobody asked for your two cents anyway so dont get all pissy when you talk shit and then get shit talked back again you made a post in a fucking comments section that is inherintly opening up a discussion he never talked shit to you until after you turned around and said stupid fucking comment i dont know how detached from reality you are but god i feel sorry for anyone who tries to interact with you the other guy gave you the benefit of the doubt in spite of the downvotes and tried to answer your question and your only response is to spew shit genuinly go fuck yourself dude this whole little string of comments just makes you seem like a pathetic twat

jailbreak,removed,hi yes i have some new info i was able to download just the first redeb from the insanelyi repo and had a look on the script actually it seems like in or someone had made similar script to mine and whats even more interesting we both named it redeb from what i could see the script shouldnt be anyhow malicious as i mentioned i had the package from another source than cyrepo but i assume that the redeb used by them will be the same as the one insanelyi has should really be my package although im still not very comfortable with the output of the help page you have listed above it really shows the help page of an gnubinary grep maybe if i could ask you would it be possible for you to repackage the scripts to deb files and upload it somewhere i could then have a look directly on the packages and give you some more info thanks

jailbreak,removed,it isnt that im canadian before you go on to make assumptions about my personal life or interests again the reason i looked is because i wanted to check if you were a complete troll or if you were just being an ass seems the answer was the latter posts of yours on the first two pages seem to be either directly debating someone or have just a negative tone to them overall ok you misunderstood completely if you remember except it is none of which is accurate no meaning what exactly fuck the morons maybe you missed actually at least so what im not arguing but you picked a terrible example i take it as a counter weight to all the endless whining so much assuming there pal you make a fair point however did you read it disagree you should try a trip to sometime umm but luca doesnt do shit these ppl whine but not that anyone else in this sub will call them out on it that link is useless for those not on mobile

jailbreak,removed,so youre saying i can install cracked ipas with the impactor and then they will run indefinitely in the jailbroken state but if i go to this safe mode it will not work after the first days of installation
jailbreak,removed,pandora downloader is also nice
jailbreak,removed,like tutuhelper
jailbreak,removed,theres an flex pirated also i installed and it worked perfect 😜
jailbreak,removed,first off i want to say i had ios jailbroken and stable for quite awhile and i wish i never updated but to me at the time it seemed a jb for ios was imminent was very wrong lol anyways iphone i made a fresh restore yesterday the last day it was signed to jailbreak was successful first try have installed many tweaks that are all working fine i want to say that i would recommend this jailbreak to the average user if you enjoy a jailbroken device and are on a supported firmware and device theres quite a bit of info you should know before hand if you are google savvy there are a few well done ios jailbreak tutorials and tweak lists good times for rjailbreak thanks to qwertyoruiopz marcograssi and saurik although unfortunately i have a feeling long term users of this jailbreak may be out of luck if apple wishes to stop the developer trial program or alter it so that its no long compatible with the yalu exploit so im being patient still waiting for an untethered exploit in the meantime
jailbreak,removed,there are alredy tweaks for this in pirated repos ✌️
jailbreak,removed,it works dont listen to anyone else
jailbreak,removed,install xcon works fine
jailbreak,removed,great idea for the mega thread for questions ill start is it advised to stay on on iphone and hope for a jailbreak for earlier firmwares
jailbreak,removed,this has been posted many times did you know google and searching reddit topics exist
jailbreak,removed,does support ios
jailbreak,removed,i desperately need lockhtml but i cant get it because i didnt purchase it before is there any way
jailbreak,removed,where do i find the link to download the ipa version from lucas website i can only find a github link with a folder to be compiled on a mac but im on pc
jailbreak,removed,not cheap just smart enough to not waste money on something easily accessible for free and the only reason i mentioned the mods making a post is so others dont end up like me also why dont you get a life
jailbreak,removed,jailbreak beta semi untethered is very buggy on ipad air cydia was working fine for a day but then when i installed a tweak it was stuck on a black screen so i had to force restart of course i had to run yalu again it didnt work i kept trying sometimes it resprang successfully it said already jail broken but no cydia i factory reset a few times it didnt work please help
jailbreak,removed,does localiapstore actually work for

jailbreak,removed,remindme hour
jailbreak,removed,anyone know why when i tap any links on the cydia homepage they become greyed out and unresponsive
jailbreak,removed,idk if this will help but if it does let me know
jailbreak,removed,i bought auxo back when it came out but couldnt download it because of the cydia purchase issue i used the biteyourapple repo to get that version and was able to activate it might be easier than risking a brick if youve purchased auxo before but cant upgrade because of the purchase issue
jailbreak,removed,only pirate tool ive used is the localiapstore i aint paying for goddamn dlc that doesnt deserve it
jailbreak,removed,appcake working or not
jailbreak,removed,when did you jaikbreak and from where
jailbreak,removed,ipa store does
jailbreak,removed,add bite my apple repo for free versions of tweeks 😉
jailbreak,removed,yeah i tried it it works but only gifpaper by insanelyi
jailbreak,removed,thats not a neck beard is a neck beard
jailbreak,removed,if i remember correctly last time i did that was on ios you have to do nothing here you need to open your carrier folder and edit the plist and enable the voip option then you should have a modified facetimedeb and you install it wait alittle bit and i am sure someone will make a proper tutorial and steps
jailbreak,removed,if you use a paid signing service like ipawind or appdb
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,i know this is frowned upon but try xcon
jailbreak,removed,i just used ipastore to install the new pangu app ipa on my iphone worked like a charm now im good for a year though i had already jailbroken my iphone with the windows pangu installer on day i tried the mac version to get the pangu app on my iphone it did install then i realized that id have to do that ever days then it dawned on me why not resign the ipa via ipastore so thats what i did uploaded to dropbox on my mac opened dropbox on my iphone exported the ipa to ipastore installed the ipa from ipastore i installed the ipa and didnt change anything from the ipastore installer just did a straight resign install deleted the chinese version of the original jailbreak app also went into cydia and deleted the other pp appstore app the original windows jailbreak installed opened the newly installed pangu app allowed notifications rebooted my iphone ran the pangu app waited a second put the phone to sleep pangu rejailbroke my phone—no problem thats it everything is working fine also note that uninstalling the old jailbreak app the pp appstore app also uninstalls the original pangu configuration file from settings general profile this should not be a problem because installing with ipastore the pangu config file is no longer needed

jailbreak,removed,i paid for a year of appdb unless you have devices it doesnt make financial sense to get a paid developer account solely for this jailbreak
jailbreak,removed,well it normally appears in cydia for me so i would assume that you can reinstall it from there repo comteironpphelperns the name is
jailbreak,removed,yes for light version for year the premium version gives you all the lite feature full appcake support download install apps from appcake
jailbreak,removed,are you a fucking idiot
jailbreak,removed,here have mine iphone
jailbreak,removed,nope even if it does you can use appcake

jailbreak,removed,wow thats a pretty intelligent bot i got off insanelyi and it works for me vs tsprotector that didnt
jailbreak,removed,works fine for me try the bya version to see if itll work on your phone as well
jailbreak,removed,tried localiapstore
jailbreak,removed,does anyone know something about tsprotector and localiapstore doesnt work on my phone
jailbreak,removed,stop bitching or do it yourself you can easily get your udid registered and provisioning for if you look online
jailbreak,removed,they get nothing as the developer accounts are bought from apple pangs see no money from this
jailbreak,removed,motherfucker i tried it and it open cydia but cydia has that little lag and i though my phone was being bricked hahaha fuck you
jailbreak,removed,why reddit user post like retard
jailbreak,removed,prick
jailbreak,removed,remindme hours
jailbreak,removed,xcon from insanelyi source works for me
jailbreak,removed,what this guys said hint get pirated versions of the tweak with out the restrictions
jailbreak,removed,im pretty sure you can donate to their paypal i believe its
jailbreak,removed,just get the pirated version for now and buy it later i dont see it as wrong when we dont have another choice are going to buy it later anyways
jailbreak,removed,he doesnt need to do anything hes doing you and other users a favor so dont act like an entitled little shit
jailbreak,removed,again being entitled little shits serves no purpose
jailbreak,removed,lol
jailbreak,removed,is your mom gone rewrite every fontapps and update it to cydia if not then shut the fuck up
jailbreak,removed,days dumbass developers find out about the jailbreak at the same time as you
jailbreak,removed,there are hack repos that have these apps available as cracked apps
jailbreak,removed,you must install from bigboss
jailbreak,removed,one way is by adding sources and pirating it
jailbreak,removed,do you know a repo that has a cracked one
jailbreak,removed,you can get it through app cake and install watusi from cydia
jailbreak,removed,cydia shouldnt have to be updated to install tweaks to the user directory you fucking tard downvote me all you want i dont care tweaks should be installed to the system partition stop trying to defend a tethered jailbreak as it is clearly inferior to an untethered jailbreak
jailbreak,removed,google zeusmos
jailbreak,removed,yeah lol i also tried that lets see all the apps we have in common and see if theres an app that isnt working properly
jailbreak,removed,nigger faggots
jailbreak,removed,ok got it but wjy apps crashes from appcake
jailbreak,removed,get app cake and install vidyo works flawlessly
jailbreak,removed,thanks the theme is called pebbli i got it from the hackyouriphone repo so i could try it first going to purchase when the next update comes out im also using folderenhancer to make my folders circular too
jailbreak,removed,hmm maybe try reinstalling the profile maybe something went wrong
jailbreak,removed,the conference seriously has nothing to do with a jailbreak please do not listen to these morons in rjailbreak or the new age jailbreak community period no jailbreak is ever coming seriously or you can just keep listening to all these extremely childish ignorant grown ups who tell you other wise

jailbreak,removed,yeah kodi is great but it is not nearly the same as having the real deal directv netflix etc it is a major pain in the ass to go through broken or poor quality links especially with how slowly kodi loads links with the few working live tv add ons they barely work are constantly buffering and usually break after a month or so thats my experience at least
jailbreak,removed,remindme tomorrow
jailbreak,removed,wen ios jailbrek i want free stuf

jailbreak,removed,i use from insanelyi repos its cool because its has short cuts and keyboards keys like tab contl c even up down left rigth keys to writhe same previous command with up key
jailbreak,removed,my fucking god you are ignorant you shouldnt jailbreak for free shit like youre probably doing httpswwwicloudcom login go to find my iphone reset it figure this out yourself youll learn if youre phone gets fucked in the future search up your problem as you arent the only person in this world someone most likely had the same issue if you cant find it generally check your wording
jailbreak,removed,its hard to say he delivered luca is a ing child and a ing troll this dick move by him confirms it the only way he could possibly troll and mess this place up more was releasing his beta devonly jb to the world nice job buddy literally of a five cydia users are ios sorry even ios has more active users im so tired of this bullshit drama tldr luca is and always will be an immature child and a rjailbreak troll is the extreme minority go away
jailbreak,removed,just download tutu for tweaks
jailbreak,removed,sup lucas altlucas salty bitch im down to discuss but you seem not to have much else to say u lil hoe
jailbreak,removed,luca told me itll be out in hours
jailbreak,removed,forget this i found the link
jailbreak,removed,this was posted in another sub so stfu and stop copying people and some original you pics of shit
jailbreak,removed,where are you getting all this you dont understand shit stop talking seriously i follow him and most of the ios security hackers i know what im getting myself into and i do know that but what does your comment have to do with anything about me apologizing to people for writing my tutorial absolutely not shit sincerely fuck off you annoying whack ass developer
jailbreak,removed,love lucas attitude hope you all whining cunts never get a stable jailbreak from him you have not deserved it in any way
jailbreak,removed,if youre going to release something after making a huge deal about it and being an attention whore why half ass it this is why im switching to android when the next galaxy comes out jailbreking was the only reason i stuck with ios android has a huge community of developers constantly pumping out improvements meanwhile were relying on a single person to come through with a jailbreak and its on the brink of going to shit because the developer is butt hurt and is throwing a tantrum pathetic
jailbreak,removed,zestia works dont listen to the rest of these guys its a code signing service ran buy a guy who goes by cynostial on twitter his service is dirt cheap and works like a charm from my experience i got my udid signed for free months ago i have tried purchasing to support him recently but he was having issues with paypal honestly thought that was a load of shit but it was eventually sorted out now i have issues paying for it for other reasons the apps work very well no revokes and an update here and there all in all if you know about these things zestia is the best imo
jailbreak,removed,im pretty sure i do its just your comeback had almost nothing related to the original argument basically fuck off
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,its a discussion you pleb where we discuss topics related to jailbreaking where you say that its in beta and people cant read youre completely missing the point that people are not going to follow rules on the internet so plans should be made to combat that to ensure the whole jailbreaking process goes smoothly which it hasnt this is surely bound to happen if you think about it youve completely missed my point im saying this could have been completely handled in a different way or at least i believe
jailbreak,removed,your loud cause your an ass simple if you have something that helps the community then say it dont spray it had to wipe my screen after reading your posts
jailbreak,removed,oh no im not rude im harsh this isnt a fucking safe zone its not politically correct and ill be offensive as its not harassment its me calling people out for their knowledge or lack their of it my post wasnt aimed at luca my post was aimed at helping the community however it wont as people try to pull this oh be nice dont be rude shit on me i wouldnt be harsh if the sub didnt lighten the fuck up and get a brain so pretty much yeah and no you commenting shit doesnt help the jailbreak either hell almost of shit in this sub doesnt do any of the three things you just mentioned so why the fuck are you going to get on my ass for it like im doing to ignorant people thats seems like your trying to call me a hypocrite which again is making you a hypocrite as you didnt contribute either by further bolstering the fucking passive nature of this sub ill be hostile as i dont care usually it tends to shut people up as the grumble at me calling me an a prick and an asshole instead of posting more shit again like a fucking idiot if i can do that one less person shhh tho thats the secret
jailbreak,removed,does it complete when you add a new repo ill have to cancel mine after theres no progress for a while and yes im able to access packages too except i cant see packages if i add insanelyi
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,no there isnt a bricked phone means it cant be fixed whatsoever you fucking idiot
jailbreak,removed,nice grammar let the nigga work on his jailbreak doesnt matter how long it takes also search the sub
jailbreak,removed,whats wrong with you today christ i know what im doing with my device that i bought i dont care if you want me to recite jailbreak on how to save my device if it fucks up fuck off i havent run into any issues yet because i know what im doing go away and wait for your stable release and stop harassing others
jailbreak,removed,appcake offers older versions of apps though their collection is limited and im not to sure if they have a version

jailbreak,removed,i found the pangu jailbreak app in appcake if i download through safari import through appcake and install will i still need a certificate
jailbreak,removed,im not being a cunt youre just a big sensitive its kind of funny that the one resorting to make calling is refering to me as a cunt that would be you if you arent able to handle straight forward remarks and you get this defensive over a secret tweak you havent made yet then i dont think youre going to be able to handle feedback from the community if you actually learn to make the tweak not to say that we are all cunts but a lot of us are straight forward when it comes to nonsense instead of lashing out you couldve realized your post was pointless and tried to make a better one

jailbreak,removed,its incredibly versatile some of my uses are short hold power button to turn onoff flashlight tap and hold on the status bar to quickly turn onoff rotation lock short hold volume up button to quickly activate the camera i use my phone for music a lot i set actions for the volume buttons so i can easily switch songs and playpause without having to take my phone out of my pocket at lock screen volume up button to skip to next track at lock screen volume down button to skip to previous track at lock screen short hold volume down button to playpause music i dock my phone in my car to listen to music so i set it to turn off auto lock when i plug it in then turn it back on and turn off the screen when unplugged when i plug in headphones i set up a menu to appear with options to go to the music app spotify iheartradio or podcasts there are a ton of other things you can do you just have to go through all the options and get creative
jailbreak,removed,the version i have is which is a few months old dont know if itll work with snap since i dont use it anyway heres the link

jailbreak,removed,download via safari install using ipa installer or some other app with cake
jailbreak,removed,download appcake or another app like that
jailbreak,removed,as other poster said you can use appcake or you can download it on you computer by making a new us account and make sure you have appsync unified installed thats what i did when it wasnt available here in india
jailbreak,removed,still think you talk down to your users and are dumb as a box of rocks for staying on only reason i created this account today because youre not just an ass but a dumb one i guess
jailbreak,removed,but look on youtube

jailbreak,removed,lol shut the fuck up
jailbreak,removed,you you are a fuckboy
jailbreak,removed,if you care this much about something completely irrelevant like a score on a social media platform kill yourself this is so fucking stupid it hurts the effort needed to gain absolutely nothing tangible should be enough to make the biggest loser deeply ashamed of him or herself jesus

jailbreak,removed,i have found a simple trick that has allowed me the opportunity to no longer need to plug my phone back in and use cydia impactor install both the pangu english app through impactor and pg client now available through appcake rotate between the two after rebooting that means jb phone using pangu ap sooner or later your phone will reboot i dont care why then run pg client sooner or later your phone will reboot use pangu ap sooner or later your phone will reboot you get my drift since ive started this method i can easily rejailbreak before it would take like times to make it take affect

jailbreak,removed,yes tutu app installs perfect and apps do get downloaded but cant install
jailbreak,removed,xcon on bigboss source worked for me 👍
jailbreak,removed,im not sure if the official repo is updated or someone just took it and updated it i use a pirate repo so im not sure i can write the address here the name is hyi hack your iphone they have some exclusive tweaks as well so im not sure if it counts as piracy look it up

jailbreak,removed,lol dude shut the fuck you you have to be pretty fucking dumb to not be able to recognize a typo
jailbreak,removed,nope but its nice tweak i got it for free
jailbreak,removed,if youre trying to fix the jailbreak detection problem just get the insanelyi repo install palfix works with the latest version of paypal the tweak is the same as the one that was removed from the original repo
jailbreak,removed,so you have activator installed and in aeternum settings is an activator action selected but it does nothing when you use it does aeternum show up at all if not please send me your udid to infoirealsmscom
jailbreak,removed,dont worry dude i pirate tweaks all the time reason being is that i got banned from paypal by selling a jailbroken phone on ebay so with paypal being the only accepted option i end up having to pirate tweaks its not a big deal man until saurik accepts a different payment method like credit cards then ill always continue to pirate theres no need to be sorry it wont hurt developers xd if an app is already pirated then you cant pirate something thats already pirated if its already available on repos like bya that wont do anything to devs

jailbreak,removed,there is reasons developers dont like the community ill give five to start with fake gratitude getting gratitude for work in a fake manner is not worth the thanks when devs get gratitude for jailbreaks tweaks etc they get thanks and praise from people but their thanks are usually empty words stupidity the amount of idiots on this subreddit is quite fascinating cant use a search bar common sense or how about fucking google piracy when a tweak is worth the money developers want compensation for it considering some need that money sadly they give up time for fucking year old kids pirating their work lack of positive input constructively criticizing and suggesting feasible tweaksimprovements are rare and developers rely on that a large percentage of the time its random stupid minor shit being asked that can be achieved with flex and the reports from users arent criticizing they are usually incompetent opinionated assholic pricks that complain that their tweak or jailbrek isnt working that doesnt fucking help anyone spam leave developers the fuck alone yes report to them problems that havent been reported beforehand because that helps immensely but dont spam them with problems they arent the users phone psychiatrist dont treat them like one especially if the problems are due to users own incompetence and error
jailbreak,removed,aye look here someone saw another reason developers hate the community this subreddit is full of pointless posts written by opinionated pricks who cant keep their inconstructive shit to themselves

jailbreak,removed,pretty sure op would get a new asshole torn if this wasnt ironically written in ghetto speak a tweak that lets you see a preview of snapchat posts in banner notifications so you know when to ignore when a woman is whoring when fully clothed but still never miss the ones when she attention whores in the nude

jailbreak,removed,i have all the necessary ones and anemone cc background cylinder linktunes for ios linktunes plugins poke for pokemon go waceflow thanks
jailbreak,removed,the fuck is wrong with you im talking about saurik if anything im more grateful for saurik and i understand where hes coming from when people are whining that their jailbreak isnt working correctly and hes only had hours notice to get cydia working right should i slow down my typing for you i think saurik the creator of cydia is not happy with the direction of this community
jailbreak,removed,just install the normal gifpaper from the insanelyi repo working great on ios
jailbreak,removed,try erasing the certificate and installing the pp app again trough the pc or trough safari or even trough appcake w the ipa

jailbreak,removed,some people are getting around it by using piracy repositories like the biteyourapple and hackyouriphone repos please do not steal from the developers i only use it for a trial to see if it is what im looking for then i purchase it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpmhfblrogew

jailbreak,removed,dont worry i was just being a prick not my normal style hell take me back years i never used to buy anything okay i started looking do use all a favour create a tweak list with flame its hard to read jpg also get this one magnificent necessary tweak to ensure cydia doesnt kill your battery capacity
jailbreak,removed,is everyone on this forum a dick go kill yourself and your family and everyone you know die in a fire and then give me your phone
jailbreak,removed,remindme days
jailbreak,removed,my point was that if you wanted to see what it was you could just read the description its something like kstore is an alternative to linkstore to get paid app store apps for free you really have to install that first to know what it is
jailbreak,removed,you must speak ching chong too
jailbreak,removed,my nigga matthew caused this
jailbreak,removed,and if you had a brain in your head and hadnt just switched over to an iphone youd know apple did away with the slide period but hey someone under the age of wants it so everyone else is dumb in the end its not me asking for a tweak good luck getting help here with that attitude
jailbreak,removed,my point is youre a jackass because people can read and entire comment thread to get the information they need but you clearly couldnt figure that out with your level of intelligence
jailbreak,removed,jesus just shut the fuck up already
jailbreak,removed,yes definitely i watch this and sinfuliphone like a hawk waiting to see whats coming and going i should have put myself to bed hours ago but im determined to make this jb work i havent been jailbroken on my phone in a year
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,uuglykido stop being an asshole if you wont help the guy then dont bother commenting
jailbreak,removed,for pc i use a cracked version of internet download manager or idm for short
jailbreak,removed,wed love to have you people who say this typically sound like idiots are you planning a pretentious dinner party or talking about rooting an android phone the less actual meaning you manage to stuff into a retarded sentence the dumber you get
jailbreak,removed,okay try this download ifunbox or itools software export all your music library to a folder soft reboot your device import all the library back to your device no need for a restore but if you downgraded from ios to using shiftupdate i recommend yo to reinstall using shiftrestore via itunes because all the ios cache can be stored on your device right now it happened to me
jailbreak,removed,download version from the biteyourapple repo i recommend uninstalling this repo afterwards though its one of those sketchy pirate repos
jailbreak,removed,some basic tweaks home
jailbreak,removed,stupid automoderator look at the sidebar link under help and answers
jailbreak,removed,the dev posted it in his twitter awhile back responding to a request for the deb
jailbreak,removed,yeah thats the guy who wrote it
jailbreak,removed,dont worry i wasnt calling you a cunt its these other cunts that piss me off the tweak creates the missing daemon to fix location once you run it after its done you can simply delete it if you want as its done what it needs to do and you only need create the daemon once hope that explains it and helps a bit
jailbreak,removed,nothing under hotspot see thats why they found out ur cellular data apn says beta maybe your on a beta version download tetherme from biteyourapple
jailbreak,removed,•​• •​•⌐■■ ⌐■■
jailbreak,removed,•​• •​•⌐■■ ⌐■■
jailbreak,removed,just fuck yourself
jailbreak,removed,youre the last person id want to tell piss off
jailbreak,removed,ehe i havent checked this username in days but holy shit you are really fucking stupid like youre probably one of those people that needs to wear a helmet kinda stupid velcro on the shoes and a bib so you dont drool on yourself levels of dumb and i mean that im not just trying to be mean i honestly sincerely mean that you are too fucking stupid to function as a normal human being without serious assistance from others thats really all that needs to be said im putting you on block btw so i dont have to deal with your idiocy anymore feel free to have the last word if it makes you feel good i wont see it i hope you keep making these nonjailbreak related oh look theres a new beta threads because that means one less thing ill have to downvote and be annoyed by
jailbreak,removed,ive just removed the repo and i havent had it installed since i deleted but i can still download it on cydia via hackyouriphone and insanleyi anything else to do should i use icleaner
jailbreak,removed,ok hey are you fucking dumb dont change the full system version via a plist if you want to spoof an app that only works on certain ios versions then edit that ipa file specifically apps are configured during install for your device version changing that number can have a ton of adverse effects
jailbreak,removed,i dont give a single shit about pokemon before you say well why are you here im reading threads on rjailbreak because im bored but you sound like the biggest douchebag ive ever encountered youve managed to use mindless drones sheep feelz in the same sentence either you are a pretentious year old virgin who thinks hes smarter than everyone or you are a year old trendy asshole who thinks hes cool because he lugs around a typewriter because its vintage all while wearing pair of jeans that has holes in them you couldve made your point using much different language and id probably wouldve agreed with you for the most part but you sound like a douchey prick so go back to your starbucks or mommys basement and be quiet already
jailbreak,removed,pokego in the appcake
jailbreak,removed,you know exactly what im talking about two weeks ago there no posts about spoofing location this week we had fucking you fucking cheaters you ruin the game for the rest of us
jailbreak,removed,or because most people on here are trying to cheat why else is rjailbreak suddenly booming with gps spoofing questions
jailbreak,removed,what difference does that make its still cheating you know people will spawn in the middle of a city where there is an infinite amount of lure and not some suburban area which most people have to deal with thats called cheating my area sucks too the closest pokestop i have is mile away but i deal with it i hate it when i blatantly see people cheat while im playing in the game
jailbreak,removed,and if youre disabled try emailing niantic about it instead of resorting to cheating
jailbreak,removed,so youre saying the posts of pokemon go cheats on here are all coming from disabled people who have a jailbroken iphone really what are the chances of that and if they really are disabled they should contact niantic instead of cheating how can you enjoyexperience the game if you cannot walk it defeats the whole purpose of the game the game is not meant for you to be siting in your room catching all pokemon its meant for you to walk around and explore your neighborhood
jailbreak,removed,go to twitchtv and count how many streamers are actually playing pokemon go without location spoofing the answer is everyone on there is cheating just shows you how much people cheat also i went on a vacation last week we rented out an entire log cabin resort and this was literally in a random forest in the middle of nowhere there was a gym at the beach there was nobody even remotely close to that beach yet somehow every minutes my pokemon at the gym were killed for one hour straight even though nobody was there on the beach and this was in the middle of nowhere and all my friends and family are on the same team mystic we tried to make a super strong tower but we couldnt even do that it was so fucking annoying and youd think youd see him if he was in range because it was an empty beach in the middle of the day so much bullshit the game is literally ruined because of cheaters i seriously hope that niantic has a response asap
jailbreak,removed,wtf does that mean it doesnt matter if people are doing it my point is rjailbreaks shouldnt facilitate cheating i doubt an aimbot tweak would be allowed on here so why is there an exception pokemon go cheating
jailbreak,removed,im looking for a chinese app store which had a spoofed pokemon go client with a gps hack and stuff can anyone identify it
jailbreak,removed,i hate gay people
jailbreak,removed,new update where can i find it on iphonecake its the old version from
jailbreak,removed,read my post below im not going to repeat myself
jailbreak,removed,disabled cannot walk of those million im sure only a small fraction cannot walk and youre also not taking age into account many old people are technically disabled in the us and theyd never play pokemon go
jailbreak,removed,if they can play sports then they can go for a walk in their neighborhood so i dont see your point
jailbreak,removed,release notes
jailbreak,removed,is there anyway to get the older version of the tweak pokemongoanywhere it seems i cant downgrade it thanks
jailbreak,removed,what are you trying to say also according to cdcgov people in the us cannot walk and are in a wheelchair including age or younger only how many of those people do you think have an iphone how many of those people are jailbroken how many of those people want to play pokemon go the number is so incredibly small and its complete bullshit that youre defending the posts on here you know most people asking those questions are not disabled you know that most people are using it as a way to cheat you dont care because you are doing it yourself
jailbreak,removed,i have not tested it on ios but please tell me too if it works
jailbreak,removed,this nigga
jailbreak,removed,thats racist o
jailbreak,removed,i hope your kidding
jailbreak,removed,thats normal
jailbreak,removed,i hope you kill yourself
jailbreak,removed,im gonna icrackhisnutsboltsandiriphissoul
jailbreak,removed,i do apologize for what im about to say but your sound very ignorant by bitching about what someone else did successfully claiming it could never happen and its people like you that keep other developers from releasing a jailbreak that everyone could benefit from
jailbreak,removed,was an alternative to which worked just fine and in those days there was barely any wait time in between jailbreaks considering it says that provided the first jailbreak for the id say it wasnt alternative to
jailbreak,removed,you cant pay ignorant entitled assholes like upauldaylong any attention cause its obvious heshe doesnt know what heshe is talking about
jailbreak,removed,fucking shut your mouth
jailbreak,removed,the rjailbreak community full of shit and stupid people disrespectful most of them doesnt know how jailbreak used to be and the community now full of indians and pakis shit want to sell it in phone small markets for fucking
jailbreak,removed,this is why i pirate whatever has drm as i dont trust those devs
jailbreak,removed,i dont care what its asking of the general population it still doesnt mean that more tweaks equals battery issues because if you perpetuate that myth then the person with three tweaks and battery issues may never find out whats causing them even though it may be one his three tweaks for someone named theiphoneguyjbqa you should absolutely make sure you have the correct as to iphone qs
jailbreak,removed,fag
jailbreak,removed,youve now changed your argument your very first comment on this thread was tweaks is why you have battery problems then and what are the chances with tweaks that one or more is sucking the life out of the battery and then thats asking waaaaaaay too much of the general population the fact is a higher number of tweaks doesnt hurt your battery and if you say so then you are wrong bad tweaks hurt your battery whether you have one tweak installed or two hundred keep pretending it has anything to do with statistics or any other reason why youre wrong but it doesnt change that youre fucking wrong
jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,im not doing the work for you or in other words i have no fucking clue i just said something without any proof because i think i know things when i clearly dont end of story
jailbreak,removed,you go pull up the questions with the wall of text list of tweaks two pages long lmao good luck dude or in other words i have no fucking clue but im going to vehemently deny that i have no fucking clue

jailbreak,removed,thank you it has a mirror that works
jailbreak,removed,doesnt currently support ipad pro or ipod touch due to a bug have paitience
jailbreak,removed,theres already alot of mirrors you could just reinstall the pp app on different mirror and youre set
jailbreak,removed,the other way is piracy i cant link it to you search google for a cracked app store
jailbreak,removed,there is a tweak which allows you to bypass the purchase thing and get paid tweaks and then you can bypass the drm with a click of a button but reddit doesnt condone piracy so i wont link it or name it
jailbreak,removed,theres a lot of mirror flying around for the pp tool so reinstalling shouldnt be a problem
jailbreak,removed,hyi
jailbreak,removed,complaint after complaint seems most of this community thinks theyre entitled to something if you can make a better jb by all means everyone will be waiting

jailbreak,removed,
jailbreak,removed,please try localiapstore i want to hack games
jailbreak,removed,it is free from bightyourapple or hackyouriphone repo i already paid for it a while back but doesnt work so i tried the free versions pirated just in case they had a tiny difference but nothing my favorite tweak honestly thank you and if anyone else knows holla at a g lol
jailbreak,removed,yes i have installed that but just the ibsoftnetcydiabeta one and it shows the new one that link shows some issues with the new cydia and icleaner download
jailbreak,removed,localiapstore
jailbreak,removed,im just suggesting but before you buy you could use a cracked repo to see if its working before you buy something like hackmyiphone
jailbreak,removed,appcake
jailbreak,removed,so anyone got ipa of the app so i can install it onto my phone d
jailbreak,removed,there is on appcake
jailbreak,removed,your english is great dont worry as for what you said you do have a point i restored using cydia impactor to keep my jailbreak and my is much more stable i the use of applications like cydia impactor or cydiarestore in ios is better cydiarestore can be a good thing but it should be considered that these do not install a new operating system but they clear the existing one ie they must delete and modify thousands of files in a few minutes everything is not always done so well is very likely that the problems known to depend just from compromised or incorrect file permissions the best thing would be to restore with itunes which currently is unfortunately not possible to do hold on now wait until the next tool jb experience shows 👍
jailbreak,removed,you can find a website to download the package from which should be legal as its a free package and then transfer it to your device with ifunbox or through ssh
jailbreak,removed,a link to such ipa would be nice i found it on appcake but it does not install because of app thinning
jailbreak,removed,if their device isnt jailbroken maybe theyre asking the question in the wrong subreddit
jailbreak,removed,at this point i dont care if i get banned you are a childish cunt you just bitch that he puts out garbage yet you havent released anything i really dont think you can create a basic hello world
jailbreak,not_removed,that cant be done as files could be different any way so the app will most likely crash you can use ifile to change it so it says you are on but that will mess up the jailbreak and the apps like i said will crash any way
jailbreak,not_removed,yea i saw that and wasnt about to try

jailbreak,not_removed,why did you buy a program if you obviously had no idea what it did i wish i had money to throw away like that
jailbreak,not_removed,mywi doesnt give you any sort of free data it simply enables portable hotspotstethering some data plans especially unlimited ones dont have this enabled but tweaks like mywitethermepdanet circumvent this any data usage with or without mywi will use up your allowance
jailbreak,not_removed,easiest way to think about it is to imagine that your data is flowing on channels with the stock personal hotspot the data that your phone uses flows on a different channel than data used by a tethered device because of this your phone company can tell how much data is being used by each and some companies charge additional charges for tethered data mywi tetherme and their like divert all the tethered data to the same channel as the phone so your phone company shouldnt be able to tell if you are tethering or not
jailbreak,not_removed,it was a good investment for all you can eat free wifi any one would jump on that deal
jailbreak,not_removed,if i am say playing csgo when my router spontaneously explodes could i turn on mywi wifi feature and tether it to my computer so i could keep on playing if so would my data plan charge me for both my iphone and computer data usage or will it only charge the iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,if im understanding all this correctly since i have an unlimited data plan through my phone but only of hotspot using mywi tetherme or others should just use my unl data correct only asking because i ran out of the hotspot this month
jailbreak,not_removed,yes you could your phone would share its internet with your computer and you could do whatever you wanted during this time any data your computer consumes in csgo or something like background updates will count towards your data allowance your phone will continue to use data as well though not at any increased amount just think of it as a router with two devices attached they share a connection and you get charged for what both use
jailbreak,not_removed,you can share wifi connections with other devices if you have a wifi connection otherwise youd be sharing your data your pc would be using your phones data so you shouldnt be charged for say pc data usage and iphone data usage it would just be charged as you using your mobile data
jailbreak,not_removed,yes that is exactly what those are for
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah because on the stock personal hotspot if i tether my data connection on my phone to my computer it will eat up my plan like crazy whereas if it was just my phone using the data it wouldnt have the same effect my question is if the same happens on mywi with the computer
jailbreak,not_removed,theres no difference between mywi and the stock personal hotspot mywi only exists so people who dont have the stock personal hotspot can tether there is still only one data source and thats your data plan mywi does not create magical free data for you or anyone else to use
jailbreak,not_removed,oh yeah it will well in theory anyway it should ive never used it to tether data to my pc as i have gb data plan between people and i had a feeling that it would tear through data because how could a pc not tear through data i would test it with a data tracker and see how much a min session uses to test the theory if its something you need to do
jailbreak,not_removed,check reddit and cydia for springtomize
jailbreak,not_removed,like to install app sync unified and erase from icloud and fix all the issue preferably do this once or twice a daygood experience right
jailbreak,not_removed,every morning icleaner every night icleanerevery single day worst habit spinning my phone between my middle finger and my thumb and i only do it when i dont have a case on idk why
jailbreak,not_removed,i place my phone on my cheek to feel if its getting hot lol
jailbreak,not_removed,i always touch on apps to make the touch menu to appear not because i use it but because i like the haptic feedback and the look of the menu
jailbreak,not_removed,like charge it every half a day
jailbreak,not_removed,i have an ipad air wifi habit on ios i swipe down on the home page in the app switcher to quit all apps via tage and turn on airplane mode in control center when im done using it my standby battery life is great dont know if this is why i guess couldnt hurt too much at least but im to the point where i cant not do this
jailbreak,not_removed,i never charge my phone full usually around i dont feel like using my phone when charged lol
jailbreak,not_removed,i always open way too many tabs in safari i think i actually got to tabs before safari just wouldnt let me go any further
jailbreak,not_removed,airplane mode when im not using it saves a lot of battery life
jailbreak,not_removed,the jailbreak section itself is an addiction for me lol
jailbreak,not_removed,this made me laugh
jailbreak,not_removed,i tried this once would recommend had a blast
jailbreak,not_removed,wtf
jailbreak,not_removed,i do that too i think its the thrill of danger xd
jailbreak,not_removed,holy shit haha thats the opposite of me never more than one tab
jailbreak,not_removed,i had tabs on chrome then it crashed twice in a row and i lost all of my tabs
jailbreak,not_removed,lol its the only reason i signed up for reddit
jailbreak,not_removed,haha exactly i havent dropped my phone at all doing that but i probably jinxed it now haha
jailbreak,not_removed,same i would compulsively check this sub looking for new tweaks until i found rholdmybeer and rpeoplefuckingdying annnnnd maybe rgonewildpetite seriously guys its a problem
jailbreak,not_removed,yep same i had no reason to use reddit found this goldmine and was stoked haha i had no idea how it worked before this actually kinda confused me lol
jailbreak,not_removed,squad
jailbreak,not_removed,squuuaaddd
jailbreak,not_removed,can i join im just a little bigger
jailbreak,not_removed,if your fingers are long enough why not
jailbreak,not_removed,all of us lined up waking somewhere spinning our phones wind blowspeople staringwhisper in the wind dangerous lmao
jailbreak,not_removed,no idea what either of these tweaks do but im going to recommend you delete the plist of cypush using icleaner pro
jailbreak,not_removed,did this already and they both give you push notifications when your tweaks have updates
jailbreak,not_removed,my battery has been good better now since i jailbroken this is what ive done install icleaner pro and disable the launch deamons you dont use use at risk works fine disabling on my device turn off background app refresh you could leave on but turn off the apps you hardly use always kill unused apps especially in app switcher location services on all apps with maps and weather switch from always to whenever in app or something keep your phone brightness down these steps will keep your battery on the smooth
jailbreak,not_removed,download batterylife and see whats going on check capacity and discharge current maybe even post a screenshot of it so someone can check if theres anything out of the ordinary with your discharge current
jailbreak,not_removed,hijacking should i replace my battery also jb on
jailbreak,not_removed,i did all of that except for daemons even on ios but it wasnt eating that much battery like it does now on
jailbreak,not_removed,i also set a static wallpaper and it seems to be a bit better now thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,it drains pretty fast
jailbreak,not_removed,wait till its around and change it
jailbreak,not_removed,takes some time for the iphone to settle down reboot or hard reboot and see if its fixed
jailbreak,not_removed,that seems about normal fast is like
jailbreak,not_removed,isnt that just airdrop
jailbreak,not_removed,has a bluetooth sharing function that requires another device with ifile
jailbreak,not_removed,bluetooth file sharing
jailbreak,not_removed,no with this you can share files with all bluetooth devices android etc
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah but ifile has that serious bug where it can delete an entire folder instead of just the file youre trying to delete if youre on ios id really stay away from ifile and use filza instead

jailbreak,not_removed,if its jailbreak detection try nosub
jailbreak,not_removed,im using phantom and get the message saying unsupported version on one account but i can log in to different accounts
jailbreak,not_removed,latest snap works with latest phantom lite
jailbreak,not_removed,snapchat is not doing bans at the moment so stop selling your false prophecies phantom lite works around the ban detection protocols and its pretty safe also phantom lite is working fine if you follow cokepokes instructions
jailbreak,not_removed,using the application as it was designed should solve your problem
jailbreak,not_removed,not work for me the app wont open did you install any tweaks aside from phantom lite
jailbreak,not_removed,snapchat is definitely doing something whether its bans or not remains to be seen but a shit ton of users yesterday were posting here and tweeting at snapchat support about being locked out of their accounts but being able to log in using a new account so its clearly not devicespecific but related to actual accounts so thats at least kind of a ban stating facts isnt fake news
jailbreak,not_removed,then why are you on this sub then if you wanted to use things the way they were intended
jailbreak,not_removed,well no not in this case still am kicked without phantom
jailbreak,not_removed,no idea but updating phantom lite and snapchat to fixed it edit nevermind i just got the message again for some reason i got banned i guess but i can still log into other accounts
jailbreak,not_removed,same just updated and it crashes immediately now editseems that streak notify crashes it instantly for me now just disabled it in icleaner and snapchat works now
jailbreak,not_removed,thats odd works fine with me but for snapchat i only have phantom lite installed nothing else uninstall phantom logged in snap and install again and see if that works
jailbreak,not_removed,my one account i cant log into on either of my iphones but i was able to login on an android device
jailbreak,not_removed,failed to notice rjailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,lets see hes using a tweak thats causing himself to get banned server side as i stated earlier a good work around for that would be using the program as it was intended until youre unbanned and the tweak doesnt cause you to be banned
jailbreak,not_removed,im on stock ios
jailbreak,not_removed,yes down vote the most truthful answer here
jailbreak,not_removed,i couldnt get working so i used to install instead and its fine again including phantom lite
jailbreak,not_removed,you clearly have something installed thats altering the application which is causing a conflict
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry for asking but where to find that streak notify on icleaner i dont see it
jailbreak,not_removed,interesting doesnt seem like theres any sort of consistency whatsoever in the ways people are banned other than through jailbreak

jailbreak,not_removed,thanks mate
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks a lot youre a legend yet another essential tweak from a great dev
jailbreak,not_removed,hello would it be possible to know if it is ios compatible i really would like to try your tweak i think it is great thanks in advance
jailbreak,not_removed,youre welcome
jailbreak,not_removed,no problem it has a heap of great features mate i use it for a real time battery discharge and charge rate right there in the status bar and just for aesthetics i have the battery level in words its funny how a great tweak like this is free yet other devs charge for a simple tweak that removes a line or something in a menu
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont know i do not have an ios device my guess is no
jailbreak,not_removed,its funny how a great tweak like this is free yet other devs charge for a simple tweak it really has more to do with my ideas about the level of support that should be required for something that is being sold than anything else id love to be making money from this with all of the time i have spent on tweak development id retire tomorrow if i had enough money to last the rest of my life so the more i earn the sooner that day will come i dont currently have a single issue with any of my tweaks on my devices but there are so many different combinations of devices ios versions and installed tweaks that other people are running that could easily cause problems that i cannot see just today i received a crash report for from an ios user something related to the new theming features that i added i didnt see anything easily identifiable as the cause of the problem in the syslog and crash log all of my devices are on and i dont use all of the tweaks that the user has installed and i dont really know what to do to fix the issue moveable is free though i do my best to try to help and fix things but at the end of the day i have no obligation to do so with a free tweak i dont feel that way about paid tweaks though even though the cost is only a few dollars i believe that if you are going to try to make money from something than you need to provide a working product and support it until it does work as i stated above that can be a challenging task with the numerous combinations of setups that exist and i just cant guarantee that i can always do that and so all but one of my tweaks has been released for free and my one paid tweak has been available as a free open beta for the entire time ios has been jailbroken precisely because i havent been able to commit to being able to fully support it if needed i dont have an exact count but i estimate that about of the developers of paid tweaks that i have tried to contact via email have not responded and i think that is unacceptable for developers of free tweaks i estimate that about of them have not responded to me thats disappointing but i dont really have an issue with that
jailbreak,not_removed,ok thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,ive never been able to get a dev to respond via email to any tweak even paid ones like protube despite the dev being active on twitter however i dont use twitter so i cant communicate to him on there really sucks when they cant take the time to respond back but yeah getting back to devs charging for really basic tweaks im blown away that a tweak like retroarch is free when its such an awesome tweak that does so so much then you have a tweak that does something really minor not going to name any as i dont want to offend any devs and they charge for it dont get me wrong they can do what they like but seems like some things provide much more and are free while others arebasically crap and add no value to the user i only have a few paid tweaks and i really only install a paid tweak if its a must have but i love trying out free tweaks and if i dont like what it does i just delete it and move on without the buyers remorse so to speak lol but what really sucks is when you spend money on a tweak that doesnt work at all and the dev just ignores you even if they replied that they were working on it or that they no longer supported it something anything latest devs that havent replied are controllers for all protube
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,just and works witch machportal on sorry
jailbreak,not_removed,only and
jailbreak,not_removed,wrong matchportal beta works only on and
jailbreak,not_removed,could be lack of people with devices
jailbreak,not_removed,well springtomize is working fine activator on the other hand
jailbreak,not_removed,springtomize ios has ios support for others tweaks remember that a lot of dev dont have a device on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,they may be waiting for the next jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,is activator working bad
jailbreak,not_removed,springtomize in landscape is screwy
jailbreak,not_removed,tweak devs very rarely if ever work on finding exploits for an actual jailbreaking tool at least the devs i know of
jailbreak,not_removed,thats not was said or implied
jailbreak,not_removed,you did not understand what i meant i meant they not be wasting there time until a new jailbreak comes because a new jailbreak could end up breaking the tweaks any way
jailbreak,not_removed,oops misread i thought he said working on not waiting for
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah responded to another comment here i misread what you wrote
jailbreak,not_removed,lol i have no idea why i was downvoted by ppl for eh but ya my bad i just noticed that haha
jailbreak,not_removed,let me know how this goes
jailbreak,not_removed,it works just it wont install cydia this is before lucas tool was released
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry man this isnt the jailbreak this is ian beers machportal not qwertyoruiops basically it gives you limited root access with read only privileges qwertys version of it is closed source meaning that you cant really modify anything yourself you also would most likely have to modify a bit more than just offsets basically this is ian beers machportal not qwertyoruiops its not a jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,idk its probably really hard
jailbreak,not_removed,👍
jailbreak,not_removed,you could try removing them by going to settings general storage icloud usage and under storage go to manage storage find the bad app and delete from there
jailbreak,not_removed,did you already try if a reboot fixes it
jailbreak,not_removed,oh thanks that worked
jailbreak,not_removed,yes also tried connecting via itunes but none of my apps show up not sure if thats related but i couldnt delete apps that way
jailbreak,not_removed,great glad i could help out
jailbreak,not_removed,you must install badgecleaner first

jailbreak,not_removed,damn iti hope not still on
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe he will make a universal app of thats what you are asking

jailbreak,not_removed,it used to work in chrome but not anymore the selection part swipe still works
jailbreak,not_removed,ok thanks d
jailbreak,not_removed,the tweak called impactor or similar spelling does this i believe
jailbreak,not_removed,yes indeed cydia impactor it is called bear in mind though for op it doesnt work well with ios as it fails sometimes also only works from

jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for the help so would that mean that it would be safer for me to simply restore my ipad since it is on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,safer youd lose your jailbreak so no
jailbreak,not_removed,well as said already it will remove your jailbreak as it needs to go to the latest ios semi restore for ios is released already and supposedly more stable than cydia impactor on ios but that doesnt mean it has success rate must see from other users opinion to be sure semi restore will keep your jailbreak unlike ci which after running is similar to reset all data and settings and therefore more suitable if you want to reuse your device not to give or to sell since some data might not be erased during the process
jailbreak,not_removed,use taig they are better for the whole ios range
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you taig worked flawlessly and in on tap as well now onto my next dilemma of getting my stuff off my iphone to my
jailbreak,not_removed,should be easy unless your is somewhere on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,my is on and my is on i can do the apps just fine but im looking to get my tweaks and those settings to my after i find out if i can run cydia eraser on
jailbreak,not_removed,change the date of your phone to when you remember it was in the day grace period reboot and your machportal works now you can now change the date back to actual
jailbreak,not_removed,what did searching the sub or google yield
jailbreak,not_removed,im in an unjailbroken state so the certificate is deleted from my phone now ive tried the method you mentioned above and had no luck ill try again and come back to you thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,hello thank you for your participation in rjailbreak however your comment was removed for the following reasons rjailbreak does not allow piracy tools sources or websites no pirated tweaks apps etc if you have any questions about this removal please feel free to

jailbreak,not_removed,why do you think is that
jailbreak,not_removed,whats the name of that widget edit found it on free iwidgets app its called
jailbreak,not_removed,what theme is that

jailbreak,not_removed,glitz
jailbreak,not_removed,did the user ever pm you about to attempt this now

jailbreak,not_removed,nope
jailbreak,not_removed,awesome
jailbreak,not_removed,i did that nothing happened do you need to respring or sthing
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,i appreciate the tweak listits great but it doesnt really give the how i was looking for but i will try to figure it out
jailbreak,not_removed,got it
jailbreak,not_removed,well that suxks i have no idea what to do lol
jailbreak,not_removed,try respringing and turn it on in settings
jailbreak,not_removed,great
jailbreak,not_removed,it still doesnt work and its on in settings what repo did you get it from
jailbreak,not_removed,zachatrocitycomrepo
jailbreak,not_removed,i got it from there as well idk why its not working
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe coming in a conflict with another tweak thats why
jailbreak,not_removed,you should only have var and etc in that directory
jailbreak,not_removed,okay so the directory was created then thats a relief doesnt explain why new apps wont download now from the app store
jailbreak,not_removed,yep just etc and var at least on ios httpiimgurcomoydrnpxpng
jailbreak,not_removed,what method were you using to install the ipa
jailbreak,not_removed,ipa installerappsync unified but now it wont even install the regular way as well
jailbreak,not_removed,oh fuck the now i deleted the e folderwhich was empty and now my apps are gone does semi restore still work in this day and age i think i really fucked my phone but i dont wanna lose my jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,cydia eraser
jailbreak,not_removed,it deleted the pp untether app cant reload the app back on it with impactor due to the same reasons i cant install appis this is the end restoring to ios right now its a shame the signing of apple software is completely fucked me out of a jailbreak yet again happened when apple replaced my entire phone when i cracked my screen

jailbreak,not_removed,its a known issue on beta should be fixed for final
jailbreak,not_removed,probably its better to get vpn
jailbreak,not_removed,its not possible you cant shsh blobs are specific for any device
jailbreak,not_removed,its not possible as first of all shsh blobs are device specific i believe and second while the and may look the same from the outside they arent inside they use a different cpu so the os cant be ported over
jailbreak,not_removed,shsh blobs are very specific and restoring through itunes requires specific hardware strings you could probably find a on on ebay
jailbreak,not_removed,nope
jailbreak,not_removed,ok thanks for the concise answer appreciated
jailbreak,not_removed,ok thanks for the concise answer appreciated
jailbreak,not_removed,i have one tho
jailbreak,not_removed,oh my god you do realize that openssh doesnt work because dropbear is the better alternative already installed uninstall openssh and ssh over usb
jailbreak,not_removed,how do i go about with ssh over usb im on windows
jailbreak,not_removed,does dropbear is installed in yalu machportal which is used iphone or plus
jailbreak,not_removed,also how do i uninstall openssh if i cant see my installed in cydia

jailbreak,not_removed,do you english bruu dont you mean does it have dropbear installed the answer is no for machportal
jailbreak,not_removed,no need for sarcasm my dude im just asking on reddit because im looking for people who have had a similar problem and solved it easier than googling shit i dont understand hope you can kinda see where im coming from but thanks for the link anyway ill check it out and see if i can get it working 👍🏻

jailbreak,not_removed,yes you have to first chuck your nokia out the window
jailbreak,not_removed,im actually waiting for ios beta to drop hopefully it will come later today
jailbreak,not_removed,why people are still surprised by ios betas apple process seems to have standardized for quite some time you have betas and then general public release

jailbreak,not_removed,apple i really dont appreciate you shoving your cold hard black betas up my ass it hurts

jailbreak,not_removed,same riosbeta is having a heart attack waiting for

jailbreak,not_removed,why do people say jb is dead when there has been several months without jb people are impatient sometimes 🙄
jailbreak,not_removed,ios does not have a new file system yet afs is in a very early preview stage and not even available on macos sierra on primary drives
jailbreak,not_removed,we

jailbreak,not_removed,op of that post made his account mins ago its a fucking troll lmfao
jailbreak,not_removed,fake
jailbreak,not_removed,this place is the cancer of jailbreaking actually
jailbreak,not_removed,like who
jailbreak,not_removed,from what ios you on
jailbreak,not_removed,if you thought by reading the title that this is jailbreak announcementyousadlyare stupid my friend 😦
jailbreak,not_removed,how does it delay jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,its not like it was going to be released anyways
jailbreak,not_removed,didnt know this sub existed thanks for linking
jailbreak,not_removed,funny as shit
jailbreak,not_removed,how the heck do you even subscribe to that place edit seriously that place has the worst css its as bad as an ios beta
jailbreak,not_removed,im fucking done waiting for a jailbreak plus i could just sideload most of the tweaks and apps that i use im really excited on the betas rather than jailbreak now hahaha
jailbreak,not_removed,that seems to rule out quite a few numbers
jailbreak,not_removed,wow he actually tweeted that
jailbreak,not_removed,cant stand this guy
jailbreak,not_removed,the kid is mentally unstable i feel sorry for him
jailbreak,not_removed,because its more or less the reality there are nearly no new tweaks because devs arent on anymore and about half this sub is now not jailbroken the numbers dwindle as each day passes there are jailbreaks for newer versions but dont count on them ever going public
jailbreak,not_removed,ive been using it for about a week now sure it has some kinks and shit but i havent had any reason to downgrade yet
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i just saw it fuck it theres my hopes again
jailbreak,not_removed,icrackurdevice
jailbreak,not_removed,i was at work and i glanced
jailbreak,not_removed,lets hope your wrong 😉
jailbreak,not_removed,haha no problem
jailbreak,not_removed,know
jailbreak,not_removed,careful though the past hours its descended into essentially a circlejerk subreddit its stuffed
jailbreak,not_removed,rule if it exists there is a subreddit of it
jailbreak,not_removed,they also removed or hid the res use subreddit style checkbox and if you point that out to them they get angry at you they prioritize making the subreddit look as pretty as they want over the subreddit or its design actually being functional if all that wasnt enough to keep me away all this circlejerking about beta isnt helping one bit
jailbreak,not_removed,go to the sub and tap the arrow facing up on alien blues tab bar it has a subscribe option
jailbreak,not_removed,i kinda disagree but thats just me
jailbreak,not_removed,do you need a mac to sideload im not sure how to do it
jailbreak,not_removed,same i already jumped ship and am living on ios beta
jailbreak,not_removed,thats exactly what i did only apps i needed tweaked were instagram n snapchat since i side loaded them im satisfied
jailbreak,not_removed,ios had two betas and ios had betas so it should be in other words no standardization which is pretty normal for software releases
jailbreak,not_removed,you should see his article is even worse
jailbreak,not_removed,its his fucking haircut
jailbreak,not_removed,same thing people have said on ios when ios came out and boom ios jailbreak came out to same thing we just have to be patient
jailbreak,not_removed,another betaios released not any kind of glance can make you think that the thread having this title is actually a jailbreak announcement or release threadstrange 😦
jailbreak,not_removed,i hope im wrong too
jailbreak,not_removed,oops thank you edited
jailbreak,not_removed,what the fuck did you gained by correcting him fucking selfsatisfaction
jailbreak,not_removed,the checkbox from res i didnt even know that was possible
jailbreak,not_removed,the apps dont mess with css that is how i ended up doing it
jailbreak,not_removed,it looks nice but hovering over things and you are getting a link to every picture they have and no subscribe button bad internal formatting is all
jailbreak,not_removed,you can sideload using ipastore
jailbreak,not_removed,yes you need a mac to sideload ended up dual booting my laptop with el capitan and windows but theres like a paid version which you will just register your udid on some website but fuck it i will just do it free i just need to reinstall it every week
jailbreak,not_removed,or a virtual machine mac
jailbreak,not_removed,please tell me how to do this
jailbreak,not_removed,i didnt consider anything so ancient apple is a company and companies evolve policies now i have the feeling they want to get out betas as soon as possible and regularly my was based on recent ios and os x betas ios and are too ancient to be considered it has been years of changes including lot of developer portal policies etc now you can even develop on a device without a dev account which was unthinkable at the time of ios to do without a paid dev account
jailbreak,not_removed,holy fuck the ads
jailbreak,not_removed,two thirds of the voters there think that apple releases so many betas to delay the jb god the readers are even more stupid than icu
jailbreak,not_removed,the eyebrows though
jailbreak,not_removed,if only it was just that
jailbreak,not_removed,the problem is jailbreaking is becoming more and more outdated when compared to the rest of ioss progress even if a jailbreak came out today how long will it be until its patched a week a month two didnt last over two weeks ios will drop in the fall and many people will end up upgrading and regardless of what happens before that date people will want an ios jailbreak and not a one then
jailbreak,not_removed,yall really dont have anything better to do while waiting for a jailbreak do you lol
jailbreak,not_removed,gain
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont see whats wrong with him correcting me
jailbreak,not_removed,not everything is about gaining bud giving knowledge is just as important
jailbreak,not_removed,bit salty eyh
jailbreak,not_removed,holy hell im all for being direct but dam have some decency for what amounts to another human being on the other end
jailbreak,not_removed,yes slight typo sorry theyve managed to hide it completely i dont know if the checkbox is simply gone or if theyve done something like ratheism did a while back and covered it with something else to cosmetically hide it
jailbreak,not_removed,curious of how you go about dual booting el capitan on a windows laptop
jailbreak,not_removed,i could do this dual booting and see how slide loading works its the best ill get till jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,are sideloaded apps valid for days still
jailbreak,not_removed,more like eyebushes lmao
jailbreak,not_removed,haha you beat me to it
jailbreak,not_removed,lmao
jailbreak,not_removed,rakt
jailbreak,not_removed,gain get gud p
jailbreak,not_removed,eh
jailbreak,not_removed,thats crazy but at least ratheism uses a normal layout
jailbreak,not_removed,you could use virtual machine but actually dual booting osx and windows is pain in the ass i only do it because the performance on vm is significantly slower so i just dual booted so i have the full performance of the osx but keep in mind not all of pc and laptops are supported all lot of reading is required
jailbreak,not_removed,goodluck thats the best we could do right now to fill up our jailbreaking needs hahaha
jailbreak,not_removed,i havent heard otherwise so that would be annoying having to revalidate every week
jailbreak,not_removed,bruhh 💀💀💀
jailbreak,not_removed,there are literally dozens of us
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah im still on ios jailbreak and im happy where i am
jailbreak,not_removed,winter is coming
jailbreak,not_removed,i spoke for the majority how many people do you know on
jailbreak,not_removed,rekt
jailbreak,not_removed,git gud
jailbreak,not_removed,fair enough i have a laptop that is getting there in age but still mostly runs like a dream hp envy with a gen and intel hd graphics not sure if it would work where would i go to figure it all out and also does imessage and facetime work for you i could never get it to work in the vm
jailbreak,not_removed,dozens
jailbreak,not_removed,speak for yourself
jailbreak,not_removed,rakt
jailbreak,not_removed,the cpu and the integrated graphics fit in perfectly for a hackintoshvirtual machine
jailbreak,not_removed,imessage facetime handoff and continuity all take a bit of extra work changing udids contacting apple to have your device whitelisted and its a bunch of work there are huge threads about it over on though
jailbreak,not_removed,actually search on youtube some tutorials on how to dual boot or on installing the os is kinda easy to be honest as long as your hardware is supported which i think is fine some tweaks on the launch parameters is also needed incase the only thing that was pain in the ass is to get like to male the components work like wifisoundetc i hvent tested inessage and facetime yet because i only use the el capitan for sideloading apps goodluck
jailbreak,not_removed,hmm actually just looks like
jailbreak,not_removed,someone is salty no one is going to take your jailbreak relax
jailbreak,not_removed,is rakt wrecked
jailbreak,not_removed,dozens i tells ya
jailbreak,not_removed,only salt here is on my popcorn
jailbreak,not_removed,yas
jailbreak,not_removed,corrakt
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,heres the urban dictionary definition of when someone gets completely destroyed ella got rekt oh my days ella got annihilated rekt httpwwwredditcomrautourbanbotwikiindex summon urbanbot what is something
jailbreak,not_removed,🙄 rakt is a word just as much as yas is a word or rekt for that matter youll soon get the knack of it
jailbreak,not_removed,so youre just gonna ignore the mega thread and post this anyway okay then
jailbreak,not_removed,if a mod can move this to mega thread that would be appreciated
jailbreak,not_removed,i was forgotten
jailbreak,not_removed,use stashing for from coolstar repo search for the repo from sidebar
jailbreak,not_removed,yep its normal
jailbreak,not_removed,its safe to have both installed there were errors in the beginning but now its all good
jailbreak,not_removed,well its either that or having a very limited amount of tweaks your choice its been working perfectly for me
jailbreak,not_removed,im scared to update lel
jailbreak,not_removed,you should add the change log to this post side you tagged it as news
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i can confirm
jailbreak,not_removed,i wish i could downgrade because when i updated anemone it doesnt display a dock that came with the theme im using
jailbreak,not_removed,yes did it remove the themes you guys were using
jailbreak,not_removed,i have a problem with bytafont tweak mode
jailbreak,not_removed,it removes bytafont tweak mode
jailbreak,not_removed,iugh anemone now seriously why does anemone lags my iphone ios but winterboard does not i mean obviously winterboard is more outdated
jailbreak,not_removed,someone have anemone deb file i want to downgrade thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont recommend it for iphone plus users its not very well optimized everything works but it does have a noticeable impact in performance its a little better by disabling anemonecolors and anemoneeffects on icleaner but i would still recommend using winterboard
jailbreak,not_removed,it removes hmx nah jk downloading now though p
jailbreak,not_removed,no it didnt remove mine
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont personally see that as a bad thing
jailbreak,not_removed,jesus fucking christ leave users alone i dont care whos fault it is or who started it or why or how just leave us alone and let us tweak in peace
jailbreak,not_removed,now seriously why does anemone lags my iphone ios depends on which other tweaks you have and which themes you have enabled it doesnt lag on my iphone with here or even on my ipod touch with youll need to post more details
jailbreak,not_removed,you can do that with icleaner could u pls tell me how cos my plus lags horribly when switching from portrait to landscape mode on home screen
jailbreak,not_removed,noticeable impact in performance which other tweaks do you have installed and which themes do you have enabled performance depends on various factors
jailbreak,not_removed,so it didnt disappear
jailbreak,not_removed,so would you rather have it let you install both and have the combination crash
jailbreak,not_removed,open icleaner and click the on the bottom left then go to cydia substrate addons and you can disable whatever you need to be careful and make sure to hit apply when youre finished
jailbreak,not_removed,right now not many but i did run my tests with only the theming engines and core dependencies enabled using icleaner so there should be no interference i do know that this is a subjective result so i could be wrong is there a tweak or developer setting that would allow me to log animations fps so i could check more precisely i only use icons and a calendar theme its a mix between muze and lotus plus the android statusbar icons no masks or effects
jailbreak,not_removed,nah it didnt disappear at all
jailbreak,not_removed,coolstar yo i installed the update and seen theres support for images how do i use those alongside using large for regular icons
jailbreak,not_removed,no perhaps devs could put egos aside and communicate and not release updates that crash devices unless you remove each others tweaks another option would be to work with your tweak on your own so it doesnt either crash a device or remove another tweak i am not blaming you i dont care whos fault it is just recognize that the users are the ones that are suffering the consequences i personally just dont update certain tweaks anymore because they are no longer reliable per that discussion the bytafontanemone conflict was found days ago before the sophomoric drama of the last week even took place publicly
jailbreak,not_removed,for some reason theres no cydia substrate addons or anything else there anyway thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,🤔
jailbreak,not_removed,if large is used anemone autoresizes the large to all sizes including so the separate image is not required or used
jailbreak,not_removed,are you using icleaner pro i am and its there for me
jailbreak,not_removed,so basically i cant use if i use large correct that means in order to use those i should just use and then a right
jailbreak,not_removed,youll get buried just like i did and i didnt even say anything against him i actually agreed with him cool community here
jailbreak,not_removed,apparently i was using a different version of icleaner just got the icleaner pro and ur understood instructions thanks 👍🏻
jailbreak,not_removed,yes if you use large it uses large for all sizes and wont use if you dont use large it uses for the relevant icons
jailbreak,not_removed,cool thanks for the info man one more thing if you dont mind is it possible to set the calendar day centered i have it offeset to like to make it fit right but make it look uncentered
jailbreak,not_removed,ill take jailbreak over stock ios any day
jailbreak,not_removed,idk man im running ios and i love it
jailbreak,not_removed,why would you update your watch to watchos when the official ios isnt even there yet
jailbreak,not_removed,seriously man after waiting for so long for a jb i am never updating my se which is now lightening fast with
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackagecommarcosinghofnoslowanimations bigboss free tweaks speed up slow animations in ios bleep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,dont even mess with it put me into a boot loop and almost had to restore my jailbreak to get it to stop
jailbreak,not_removed,i used to use tinct on my previous jailbroken ioss and it worked as a temporary solution till nighmode got an update and currently tinct still works perfectly on ios you can pick dark colors for the huds keyboards cc notification center and app tints i would recommend it for now
jailbreak,not_removed,im with you on this one man night mode was the shit i hope the dev updates it soon
jailbreak,not_removed,the developer was pretty quick on updating to it was also a free upgrade for past purchasers i imagine it shouldnt be too long before a fix is under way
jailbreak,not_removed,im with you there while im using eclipse for the time being i much prefer the look of nightmode the dev hasnt posted anything on twitter in over days but i still sent them a message there anyway
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah see this is the same same issue i had i did get around it by holding the up and the powe button down soing a soft reset but i do indeed need this updated
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah the issue i see with this is its not editable to change the background of the settings and some other key features its def cool ive never seen something change the volume key colors pretty complex
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah same brother some of the devs just kinda took off if you know what i mean i hope someone if not him updates this its truley a gem and one of the main reasons for the jb
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i would love to use nightmode unfortunately not compatible rn
jailbreak,not_removed,how u solve this problem i installed night mode and im in loop right now i tried what u said but still no fix maybe i dont do it right can u explain plz
jailbreak,not_removed,im keeping my fingers crossed it gets added natively in ios
jailbreak,not_removed,what you need to do is probably boot ink nosubstrate mode to uninstall the tweak get rid of the process of any apps and turn off your phone rejailbreak but this time youll hold the volume button when booting into your jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,i had apple file conduit installed lucky me then went to raw file system to librarymobilesubstratedynamiclibraries and deleted i forget what the tweaks actual name was but you get the idea
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah failing an update this would be the next best thing ill take eclipse over the eyesearingly whiteness of stock ios any day though
jailbreak,not_removed,i thought that doesnt work no substrate mode is currently broken isnt it if i try to do this the device boots into normal mode instead
jailbreak,not_removed,i tried pressing volume up but didnt work i solve the problem by luck i think i rejailbreak the device then i went to cydia quickly after the device work and i deleted its strange how the device give me time before its restart again
jailbreak,not_removed,no substrate mode has been updated i installed and had the same problem im telling what i did that worked
jailbreak,not_removed,use cydia eraser amd start your phone from scratch it will run like new while keeping the same ios version in your case
jailbreak,not_removed,first of all i elected to stay on indefinitely because its really stable for me also you dont need to use the pp app anymore just go to jbmeqwertyoruiopcom to rejailbreak its much more reliable if you want to start fresh you can always use since its compatible with ios but not however if you really want to upgrade here are some more detailed answers yes you can prometheus is a little interesting to make work at first since you might have to work out some dependency issues it also only supports mac but it can be run on windows using a vm tutorial before following it check if your blobs are valid by uploading them to yes most reports say it is just as stable as yes however please dont use ifile anymore since it hasnt been updated in ages and may have some fatal bugs instead use if youre wondering about any other compatibility check the i really dont think imessage games are worth updating to ios and its crappy control center but you do you
jailbreak,not_removed,upgrade it to ios i did it on my iphone from ios via futurerestore and i dont regret it you will have rise to wake not on iphone raw photos shooting new imessages its running smooth you will love it
jailbreak,not_removed,only if the blobs are valid yes yes but see rule about localiap store if your blobs are valid
jailbreak,not_removed,stay at
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,dudei have a as wellall ill say is is super stable for meyalu is by far a better jailbreak than for meeverything about it is just sweet wipes droolfor memy own opinion and i have been jailbreaking since green poison as well so u can guage my experience from that if u can trust a strangerthen trust meupgrade boom boom boomu wont regret it
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackagecomsaurikimpactor cydiatelesphoreo free utilities specific utility to unjailbreak most devices filza could not find info about this tweaktheme hizinfiz is bae type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i also reply to pms i currently only work with default repos please do not reply to this comment reply to the one above me so it goes to their inbox httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot httpswwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobotwikieditingcomments
jailbreak,not_removed,cant agree more with the crappy control center on ios ill do anything for an ios cc tweak been looking for one for a while
jailbreak,not_removed,the main reason i want imessage upgrade is because im tired of all my messages saying this person liked this text fireworks and shit
jailbreak,not_removed,i wish i had save bobs now ill stay on
jailbreak,not_removed,how do you check if the blobs youve saved are valid
jailbreak,not_removed,i read the rules and didnt think i was violating rule but ive edited to be more compliant anyway thanks for your reply how can i check if my blobs are valid
jailbreak,not_removed,oh yeah i forgot about those i always laugh when i get spammed with this person liked the entire text recopied
jailbreak,not_removed,also for prometheus to work properly the currentlysigned sep must be compatible with the target ios version currently the sep for ios is definitely compatible with however ios just got released and while a few people reported its sep is also compatible with there are a few conflicting reports tldr prometheus definitely works right now but it might not in the future so if youre going to update you should do it now edit prometheus would still work fine indefinitely however touchid will be broken if the sep is not compatible
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,exactly its so damn annoying
jailbreak,not_removed,oh shit how can i make sure my touch id will work
jailbreak,not_removed,when you get to the part of the tutorial where it tells you do download the currentlysigned version of ios from ipswme and unpack it go get the buildmanifest and baseband files make sure you download ios and not will probably work too but since is still signed theres no reason to risk it the ios sep is guaranteed to not break touchid
jailbreak,not_removed,how much longer is going to be signed i know nobody knows for sure but rough estimate i dont want to do it tonight and was thinking tomorrow but if its really an urgent matter i can get it done tonight
jailbreak,not_removed,you probably have about days since was released just yesterday however as you mentioned no one knows and they could stop signing it tomorrow if they wanted
jailbreak,not_removed,to put it easily nope
jailbreak,not_removed,jailbreaking your ipad wont allow verizon on your ipad you need to unlock it either officially or with third party service
jailbreak,not_removed,sample of a lifted keyboard too high tho triggered by the pushability tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,stupid idea try pushquite hard the top right corner of the screen display edge all of the connections are based in the top right of the phone and it chance connect the adapters together if that is even the problem i know it is stupid but it could work to fix the display
jailbreak,not_removed,worst case scenario change the screen yourself wwwifixitcom or go to a non apple repair shop i have replaced a couple of screens myself and it is not to tricky the only important thing is that you need to swap the home button from old device to new device which requires a little tlc when separating the rubber membrane from the digitiser this would be the route i would be contemplating
jailbreak,not_removed,unfortunately you wont be able to boot into a jailbroken state without touching your screen go to a different apple store they have no right to refuse you service due to an unrelated cosmetic flaw
jailbreak,not_removed,i guess if a jail breaking like jailbreaakme was released you could use this methods to enter safari and download it but at this moment no
jailbreak,not_removed,wasnt there a tool that was recently leaked for breaking into ios devices i didnt read much about it so i have no idea what it can actually do or if its even legit however if it does work that at least means you have a chance of getting a backup can anyone with more info on this chime in
jailbreak,not_removed,what country are you in look up on consumer law and familiarise yourself with the basic points the cosmetic damage should not be enough for them to refuse you especially as it is still under warranty
jailbreak,not_removed,i thought they had no right either my warranty is up in a month and they even admitted that the scratch has absolutely no effect on whats causing the screen not to work so im confused on why they wont help me i even contacted a few different apple workers through the website and they said that since theres a scratch they cant give me a newdiscountedany friggen type at this point phone im a really tiny year old girl so in person and over the phone im not the best at voicing how annoyed it makes me thank you so much for your reply tho i appreciate it so much i think im gonna have to just live without backing it up
jailbreak,not_removed,you need a license key to use it and no one has yet cracked it
jailbreak,not_removed,can we see pictures of the damage they claim you have what im surprised about is apple has offered discounted replacement phones for people for years for various issues like water damage and frame bendage i dont get why there giving you a hard time now especially when your in warranty
jailbreak,not_removed,go to a different apple store in person just stating facts here youd be surprised how powerful it is being a girl in an apple store my sister gets a lot of free shit like a new phone when her phone breaks not just showered with free shit just go in and be nice and hopefully a nerdy little employee will cut you a break
jailbreak,not_removed,you could try ifunbox just as long as the device has been connected and synced to itunes before that saves some datanot all unfortunately
jailbreak,not_removed,what happens when the female employee comes to help instead
jailbreak,not_removed,again hopefully she gets a guy theres no guarantee
jailbreak,not_removed,its the same as erasing all content and settings
jailbreak,not_removed,problem is if you have a boot loop you wont be able to have the password screen at all the ssh method is the safest imo
jailbreak,not_removed,all it does is factory reset your phone same firmware
jailbreak,not_removed,try googling erase all content and settings iphone openssh
jailbreak,not_removed,lol
jailbreak,not_removed,i usually update first then update snapchat
jailbreak,not_removed,ok thanks any advice on watching for such updates
jailbreak,not_removed,simply put do not update whenever you find an update available wait a day or two then check this subreddit if anyone experienced something and youll be good to go
jailbreak,not_removed,cool thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,oml
jailbreak,not_removed,its not compatible i believe only bit devices were and only if you were jailbroken and have the blobs either saved manually or via tinyumbrella i havent used it since my iphone tbh
jailbreak,not_removed,the wasnt ever on so no even if you could downgrade you couldnt
jailbreak,not_removed,lol
jailbreak,not_removed,hello im removing this post because i think youre posting about possible jailbreak downgrade or upgrade options for ios latest jailbreak currently ios are jailbroken you can use httpenpanguio jailbreak ios is jailbreakable if you have a device you can use httpenpanguio or later jailbreak ios and are not jailbreakable with any tool there is no eta for the jailbreak and nobody knows when it will come downgradesupgrades it is not possible to downgrade or upgrade your device to ios should i upgrade to nobody knows which ios version is best to be on in preparation of any potential jailbreak it could come out for any version
jailbreak,not_removed,just dfu mode and restore
jailbreak,not_removed,dfu mode itunes is giving me error when downloading the new update
jailbreak,not_removed,download the ipsw manually from httpipswme
jailbreak,not_removed,make sure you read all of this go to this link and find the carrier file you need might take a while as there are a lot of files but the search function built in the browser should make it easy i dont think you can downgrade carrier bundles though like came with carrier bundle and ive tried downgrading to bundle and it just stays the same and they have to be bundles for that ios an ios carrier bundle will not work on ios and same goes for trying to use an ios bundle on ios it can cause a bootloop as ive read that somewhere make sure you activate carrier testing in itunes you may have to google how to do that because i dont remember off the top of my head httpaxphobosapplecomedgesuitenetwebobjectsmzstorewoawacomapplejingleappserverclientmzitunesclientcheckversion heres the link and im not responsible for what happens as it is your choice to do this
jailbreak,not_removed,exactly i just didnt know the right way to say it without missing any important info
jailbreak,not_removed,i just tried it eddie i downloaded the bundle unzipped it modified the carrierplist and added the allowsvoip string rezipped exactly as the original was loaded up the ipcc through itunes rebooted and still facetime wouldnt appear i believe jailbroken device is the requirements i still wanted to try for myself is there anything else
jailbreak,not_removed,i highly doubt it
jailbreak,not_removed,you cant update to ios so just jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,you cannot upgrade a phone to a firmware that isnt signed there is no way to get your to just jailbreak it where you are
jailbreak,not_removed,cant you just use that tweak to hide a folder with the apps u want to disappear cant remember the name of it but i remember i used to have a tweak that would hide my folder of all the stock apple shit i didnt want to see
jailbreak,not_removed,i have a one page setup too and use the first app in the folder becomes the springboard icon so you could dump all unwanted apps in what would become a hidden folder i also use so i can double tap the icon and go right into the app without opening the folder
jailbreak,not_removed,this would work but i wanted a one page setup currently all the icons are filled up for my page and adding an extra row to place the hidden folder would make the icon layout offcentered if i didnt add an extra row im left with a blank page if i swipe
jailbreak,not_removed,bigboss tweaks improves and extends ios folders httpcydiasaurikcompackagemequsictaptapfolder bigboss free tweaks single tap folder to open first app bleep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,but the folder would be hidden
jailbreak,not_removed,have you tried tweeting at them and asking them to incorporate this ive had some success via that method it took me about a month or two but i got them to fix the connectimmediate disconnect bug
jailbreak,not_removed,yassssss please
jailbreak,not_removed,and one that lets us mute channels seamlessly like without opening the app im imagining a cc button that when held allows you to drag through the list of servers and opens a new panel for channels upon release over the channelserver desired mute a mute toggle appears possibly with the extra types of mutesuppress mentions etc

jailbreak,not_removed,yes thats normal all it means is that your certificate has been replaced or removed
jailbreak,not_removed,not unless i use a different id every time
jailbreak,not_removed,i never have but thats probably because i always resign it before the day period is done
jailbreak,not_removed,its a good thing its apple freeing up your day cert so it can be reused on yalu
jailbreak,not_removed,not every time but sometimes not sure why
jailbreak,not_removed,dont use multiple computers and yeah apple has done it to me too even as a dev
jailbreak,not_removed,k thx guys
jailbreak,not_removed,did you run into issues being a developer or you still get the period 🙄🤔
jailbreak,not_removed,sometimes it would sign and then out of no where theyd revoke it if your using multiple computers using impactor that might be why there revoking it
jailbreak,not_removed,so if it gets revoked it means youll have to resign the ipa again 🤔 i suppose that means apple can randomly revoke the certificate whenever they want within that
jailbreak,not_removed,pretty much but depending on what you sign it might look more suspicious then others
jailbreak,not_removed,ill probably sign it from one or two computers just once anyway since i am not planning on restoring multiple times
jailbreak,not_removed,only use one computer to sign using impactor with an id if your use multiple using the same id theyll revoke it from my experience
jailbreak,not_removed,alrighty ill follow you advice then thanks a lot sir 👏🏻😊
jailbreak,not_removed,snapchat was down earlier today but theyre up again
jailbreak,not_removed,no issues here using snap
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont have any jailbreak or anything but snapchat wouldnt work for me around that that time either i think sc might have been down
jailbreak,not_removed,ah okay thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,how does snap work i read an article about it a few months ago but i dont have a mac anymore on
jailbreak,not_removed,i think its because you have the beta version of cydia
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i have beta maybe its because of that should i keep use it or delete it
jailbreak,not_removed,i downgrade because the crash was bothering me
jailbreak,not_removed,how did you do it
jailbreak,not_removed,install filza bigboss repo and then go to this link click open in filza click the file again and install it
jailbreak,not_removed,add it to a playlist on your computer then save it for offline then go on your phone and save the playlist for offline not sure if this is how you want to do it but it works
jailbreak,not_removed,also i believe that spotify uses their own music file type i could be wrong so you cant use bridge or any on device appstweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,i would highly recommend songshift app songshift by ucpdigitaldarkroom cpdigdarkroom this guys do things right with songshift you can transfer between apple music deezer spotify and tidal any way you like
jailbreak,not_removed,i cant find songshift on cpdigitaldark repo
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe he wants to accomplish that without spending money afaik thats a premium feature
jailbreak,not_removed,i remember being able to import a song to my music library and then being able to download through the local files playlist in spotify
jailbreak,not_removed,cool app
jailbreak,not_removed,ive tried exporting from apple music to spotify but it just sits on the processing screen and never finishes how do i fix this
jailbreak,not_removed,its on the appstore not cydia
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,not sure but a large library may take some time to be processed let me know if you managed or not
jailbreak,not_removed,even when trying to export song it doesnt work
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry bud i couldnt help you better ask dev to solve the issue
jailbreak,not_removed,theres a setting in phantom to report bugs to the developer
jailbreak,not_removed,this worked for me like a charm
jailbreak,not_removed,he just tweeted he is aware of the license bug and will deliver a fix asap question what version of snapchat are you running and what version of phantom lite
jailbreak,not_removed,interesting did you log in and all of that too
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah but also get
jailbreak,not_removed,uninstall snapchat and all snapchat tweaks reinstall snapchat open all messages and stories clear all messages close snapchat and open cydia install sac bypass and whatever snapchat tweak you use done source
jailbreak,not_removed,all i did was reinstall snap and ive been fine i didnt delete anything didnt download anything extra ive not had any issues
jailbreak,not_removed,all i ever got was the hr ban message and never got banned then i looked and the message was gone and ive had no issues since
jailbreak,not_removed,you dont have to install that tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,awesome one of those tiny but necessary tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for making this any chance we can set multiple alerts instead of just one
jailbreak,not_removed,confused as to how this isnt already a thing in stock ios
jailbreak,not_removed,im hoping for being able to set a daily limit apart from the total cellular data
jailbreak,not_removed,a daily limit would be good as well
jailbreak,not_removed,ios compatibleplease
jailbreak,not_removed,im not even jailbroken anymore but i have a suggestion would it be possible for you to set a limit daily and anything that you dont use on day can roll over to day and it keeps rolling over until it resets at the end of the month
jailbreak,not_removed,does the limit includes wifi and cellular data because i constantly changing between two because my wifi is unlimited and my data is only so can i distinguish between those two
jailbreak,not_removed,are you looking for this to be a simple request filler ie monitor cellular data once threshold is met warn or are you looking to add features like data tracking and limits with time vs data usage etc etc there was a wonderful app for ios called by mo ritz but its not compatible with ios and above and i have been wanting to find its replacement
jailbreak,not_removed,ily
jailbreak,not_removed,also useful would be multiple cutoff points one to firstdisable only lte data which would slow bandwidth then a hard cutoff no cellular data limit thanks looking forward to this tweak and will be donating once i have further details
jailbreak,not_removed,hello thanks for taking up the task for us all can i make a special request the billing cycle for me resets every days not monthly and it is to the minute for example at please thanks best of luck to you
jailbreak,not_removed,good luck dude
jailbreak,not_removed,this is a must have tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,oh sweet ok thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,sounds awesome thanks for the hard work
jailbreak,not_removed,question the internet provider im with has free internet data between and anyway you can add something like that into this app id love to try and manage my downloads for podcasts
jailbreak,not_removed,what about wifi usage and blocking
jailbreak,not_removed,activator integration would be great for example one could have many triggers that switch data on profile a and integration would make it easy to switch to profile b where the data action isnt included
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you so much only got on my contract so this will be a blessing
jailbreak,not_removed,i can finally turn on wifi assist since i wont have to worry about going over thanks for the great work
jailbreak,not_removed,so cool can you make it so you can have data cap per app for instance when instagram reaches freaking gb it disables
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you so much for this
jailbreak,not_removed,wow awesome
jailbreak,not_removed,would be nice if you could allow it to still permit some specific data functions automatically without going into the settings and turning off the limit like having to use maps or something
jailbreak,not_removed,can you implement a app filter function filter a specific apps data do not count it into the total amount data usage
jailbreak,not_removed,great idea hope it works out
jailbreak,not_removed,great idea im surprised apple doesnt have this already builtin the os then again we jailbreak for the reasons to make apple products perform the way we want maybe we are all control freaks jks
jailbreak,not_removed,how reliable will this be though my iphones data usage and my telcos data usage are never in sync and the telco is always right
jailbreak,not_removed,will the final version be on the big repos bigboss modmyi etc
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you for putting in the time to make this
jailbreak,not_removed,the one thing i loved about android was the ability to set this cap based on your billing cycle really a super simple setting but definitely a useful one im looking forward to this tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,any way of making it so certain apps are not tracked eg apple music because my phone carrier has no data limit on it
jailbreak,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit has anyone tested cellularmonitor on ios footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
jailbreak,not_removed,this already exists even on non jailbroken phones its called verizon s
jailbreak,not_removed,remindme week this is awesome news im looking for a tweak like that for a long time thank you very mich for your work i appreciate it
jailbreak,not_removed,activator support if so please add activator triggers i could switch between sim cards or turn off data and turn on wifi itd be a great help
jailbreak,not_removed,nice take a look at the android ui for this feature might inspire you
jailbreak,not_removed,is there a way you can put a meter in the status bar of the exact data usage that you can reset each month btw thanks for doing this you are awesome sir
jailbreak,not_removed,i think that this tweak should be free as it is a feature everyone should have i know from experience people can chew through data without knowing it
jailbreak,not_removed,i was aiming for alerts
jailbreak,not_removed,so cell phone providers can make more money
jailbreak,not_removed,should be golden i dont have a ios device but your welcome to test the open beta when it is on my repo
jailbreak,not_removed,only cellular data

jailbreak,not_removed,this could be made with and if he dont include it in his tweak 😉
jailbreak,not_removed,my service provider has data packs that last and days also complete customisation would be ideal as i imagine others will have day day and day limits too
jailbreak,not_removed,this will only monitor cellular data
jailbreak,not_removed,it will measure all incoming and outgoing data since the last reboot so it is as accurate as possible however as a trade off of that is it requires manual counter resets
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,lucky for you i just released the beta if you want to check it out
jailbreak,not_removed,i live in australia
jailbreak,not_removed,people on verizon can use this too they can set it to notify them at and data usage and if this tweak has it have lte shut off at or then have cellular data shut off at
jailbreak,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of week to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
jailbreak,not_removed,ew typical android look
jailbreak,not_removed,datameter does this if youre not currently using it
jailbreak,not_removed,youre my hero definitely gonna help me out sometimes im streaming music on the road and get a carrier text that ive used of my data and theres like weeks remaining till the next cycle lol
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks so much for making this hope it supports also pls all the best dev
jailbreak,not_removed,that sounds good what about ios support
jailbreak,not_removed,could you make it include wifi i use a hotspot that allows a day with an optional if you go over but a warning before that first would be really handy
jailbreak,not_removed,can you make a distinguish between the hours i have data packages one is only between unlimited and other is

jailbreak,not_removed,alright thanks for your work though but using cellular usually makes the iphone too hot and drains battery a lot unlike using wireless as it also gives better battery life too as well
jailbreak,not_removed,sweet ill try it out since lately ive been reaching my data limit a lot more
jailbreak,not_removed,should be golden i dont have a ios device but your welcome to test the open beta when it is on my repo
jailbreak,not_removed,yes this too forgot to mention it
jailbreak,not_removed,the point of this tweak is to disable cellular data if a limit is reached as unlike wifi cellular data plans have much less data than wifi and it is easy to go over
jailbreak,not_removed,wow thats pretty cool i have att at the moment but my contract is up will look into this
jailbreak,not_removed,alright man good luck with your work
jailbreak,not_removed,tmobile also has binge on which you can use to watch youtube netflix and some other services as much as you want and it doesnt count towards your data either
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,its probably a theme issue was your theme recently updated and what them wing engine are you using winterboardanemoneetc
jailbreak,not_removed,anemone and theme is ace iii newly released i messaged creator hoping to hear back
jailbreak,not_removed,ahh ace iii is pretty new probably just a bug
jailbreak,not_removed,itransmission is a good ios torrent client that allows you to download torrents and copy them to apps such as vlc in case of media files bridge is a cydia app that allows you to download files import them and edit their tags
jailbreak,not_removed,and bridge no pirating allowed
jailbreak,not_removed,i know easy way to transfer between different computers cant find my flash drive gonna use old iphone as a wireless one pcdropboxtorrentdrivephonemac but be able to use them on the phone
jailbreak,not_removed,ah well idk if any one will help since that sorta leads to piracy and thats not allowed here even though ppl do stuff thats just as bad and is the same thing lol
jailbreak,not_removed,well thanks anyway
jailbreak,not_removed,np sorry for not being much help not so much you can help with when its the rules of the sub
jailbreak,not_removed,atleast unify works for you this shit doesnt work for me
jailbreak,not_removed,every alarm safe mode crash this is annoying i cant wake up because of this i sent a crash log to his email no response i am posting here out of desperation i am tired if buying tweaks that dont work
jailbreak,not_removed,uspiritoflogic
jailbreak,not_removed,i havent had a single problem with unify yet i dont understand what everybodys complaining about i have a on and several other tweaks like noctis installed
jailbreak,not_removed,it crashs because of notics remove notics and youll be fine had the same issue and he said it is because of notics and hes working on it
jailbreak,not_removed,im using tinybar and unify and always using alarm monday to saturday working fine
jailbreak,not_removed,works perfectly fine for me
jailbreak,not_removed,works perfectly fine for me too
jailbreak,not_removed,its perfectly working so you must check your tweaklist for conflicts
jailbreak,not_removed,never even did its job for me like it wasnt even installed
jailbreak,not_removed,battery indicator tweak please
jailbreak,not_removed,what tweak did you use to get all the notifications together edit im a huge idiot 🤦‍♂️😐
jailbreak,not_removed,my crash reporter isnt working
jailbreak,not_removed,did you send the crash reports to the dev i had one crash with unify as the suspect weeks ago but nothing since
jailbreak,not_removed,lmao he wont reply hes made his money off you already have you not learned from every other tweak he released lol
jailbreak,not_removed,at least it worked with the crash reports
jailbreak,not_removed,and this dev had the nerve to get annoyed when people have him a hard time about charging for upgrades he charges a fortune for his tweakswhich is his call but if you do that at least support your customers
jailbreak,not_removed,im using unify i dont have too many other tweaks and alarms work
jailbreak,not_removed,how is the developer supposed to see this email them with this information and crash logs not post here where theyd have to actively search for this thread to know about it
jailbreak,not_removed,on which version of unify are you and did you officially purchased it
jailbreak,not_removed,if youre gonna complain then at least post your crash logs otherwise how do you expect anything to be done
jailbreak,not_removed,i concur and i regret
jailbreak,not_removed,same for me it sucks that such a useful tweak wont work for all of us
jailbreak,not_removed,did you officially purchased it
jailbreak,not_removed,i think you have some conflicting tweaks because i use unify and im using alarms every morning with no problem do you want me to send you my setup on unify maybe its a specific option that can help narrow it down for sol
jailbreak,not_removed,im sorry for issues but dev probably wont respond unless you offer him a few bucks for helping very driven by cash only
jailbreak,not_removed,do you have touchr installed
jailbreak,not_removed,ive seen lots of people have issues with unify back when it was first released as well personally i havent seen uspiritoflogic do anything about this besides a comment here or there but maybe hes working on a fix im sorry for issues but dev probably wont respond unless you offer him a few bucks for helping very driven by cash only
jailbreak,not_removed,lithium ion repo

jailbreak,not_removed,i did
jailbreak,not_removed,exactly
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah and followed the steps as well im done with it
jailbreak,not_removed,sure a tweak list would also help i want to see what you have and what i have so i can remove stuff
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah a real shame

jailbreak,not_removed,my apologies then i just dont see the point in these posts if youve already contacted the developer
jailbreak,not_removed,thats why i refuse to buy it itll get a few more updates maybe and then ill have to buy a new one in a year no thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,so tinybar was causing the alarm crash for me not unify
jailbreak,not_removed,ill add a tweaklist later
jailbreak,not_removed,might want to post your list so more people can cross off what they dont have
jailbreak,not_removed,i had the same problem but it was caused by touchr just an idea
jailbreak,not_removed,he isnt responding not trying to communicate with us this post is to spread awareness and maybe make him see that updates are needed for his broken tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,the dev doesnt care about anyone or anything besides the money he makes from people buying his tweaks imo hes one of the worst devs
jailbreak,not_removed,he never communicate im afraid that is why i dont buy unify even tho its so cool but the dev is just not helping others who bought the tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,thats more and more of a problem to all dev out there if a user takes the time to report to you a problem or suggest an improvement or a new feature to your tweak please take the time to respond this is customer support

jailbreak,not_removed,not quite what youre describing but i think setback can help you achieve that
jailbreak,not_removed,closest i found was pkgbackup save and restore different set ups backups though its not ideal you can save locally or on dropbox
jailbreak,not_removed,curious what setups are you trying to have
jailbreak,not_removed,this would be fantastic to find a solution to
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,well you could disable tweak and enable tweak via icleaner pro but it aint automatically so it would be more of and walkaround and not the perfect way to do it
jailbreak,not_removed,yes setback will work i use it mostly for themes but each snapshot has a lot of different tweaks disabled and it works great for that
jailbreak,not_removed,would i have to manually install all the tweaks i had
jailbreak,not_removed,just trying to expiriment with setups like this while still trying to keep my own personal setup on my phone and easily switch between different setups
jailbreak,not_removed,is there a free alternative
jailbreak,not_removed,is there a free alternative
jailbreak,not_removed,no
jailbreak,not_removed,i just installed it everytime i try to back up or press on settings within the app it crashes i have enabled it to scan cydia packages in the settings app anything else i need to do to stop it from crashing
jailbreak,not_removed,hmm working fine for me but only backing up cydia packages and only to local storage
jailbreak,not_removed,just in case you were trying out the app with a free cracked version in my experience with pkgbackup only the paid version works properly i know its and you always want to try a tweak that more that a couple dollars before you commit but as far as i k ow only the paid version actually works
jailbreak,not_removed,but when the phone is charging isnt it lying on a table covering the camera
jailbreak,not_removed,have you never used your phone while its chargin plus thats an option you can have it on at all times please like to get attention
jailbreak,not_removed,can anyone else confirm that pgcheck is safe and reliable
jailbreak,not_removed,im also wondering
jailbreak,not_removed,i have the same issue did you find a fix
jailbreak,not_removed,i just signed out of icloud and it fixed it no idea if thats the real reason
jailbreak,not_removed,a reboot of my ipad fixes the issue for me also restarted cydia impactor
jailbreak,not_removed,actually i did in the form of a redmond pie article addressing the issue but it was so long ago that i cant find it i started having it again a few days ago but i couldnt find the article so i just kept retrying till it worked i restarted my phone and revoked the certificate and that seemed to help this time
jailbreak,not_removed,tweak mode removes anemone which removes all of that
jailbreak,not_removed,bytafont conflicts with anemones optitheme daemon causing it to crash among other strange things mainly caused by bytafont stealing code from anemone
jailbreak,not_removed,because you dont know how to search
jailbreak,not_removed,i have anemone and bytafont tweak mode running together just fine soi dont know
jailbreak,not_removed,stfu
jailbreak,not_removed,then u havent updated them recently
jailbreak,not_removed,awe is baby going to cry 😂😂
jailbreak,not_removed,just checked now anemone has an update the last time i checked cydia for an update was over hours ago thats why i didnt know
jailbreak,not_removed,really it deleted tweak mode for me like a week ago during an update maybe you werent connecting to there repo for the last week or so
jailbreak,not_removed,what is going on
jailbreak,not_removed,this will help solve peoplegood thinking
jailbreak,not_removed,ive removed this post youre welcome to repost it without retarded in the title

jailbreak,not_removed,xmodgames
jailbreak,not_removed,xmods i bet ya
jailbreak,not_removed,unsure what xmodgames is but i certainly dont have it i dont play games on my phone really what i do know is i just unlocked my phone and it went from ma to on the springboard im unsure what an average ma usage is supposed to be but im pretty certain it should be half that or better im only using half screen brightness location and bluetooth off and am purposefully closing all apps to cut that out only at cycles on my battery
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone plus user here my discharge rate can be that high sometimes too with nothing running and wifi and bluetooth off is it a plus model
jailbreak,not_removed,it is a the thing is it wasnt doing this at all until recently its also clearly overheating while doing absolutely nothing im getting over if i leave it on the springboard or battery life if i actually do something like use safari it can go all the way to ma
jailbreak,not_removed,i just got my six plus replaced under warranty due to over heating and massive battery loss id give them a call and see what they can do for you
jailbreak,not_removed,you could use a modified extender
jailbreak,not_removed,i just love the way this sub deals with issues that are uhhhhmmm dis all lol three extender is amazing btw
jailbreak,not_removed,extender with the and use its auto sign feature its worked twice for me now already wake up in the morning to notifications that my cert expired but its been resigned 👌🏼
jailbreak,not_removed,where can i find that
jailbreak,not_removed,just asking do you need to trust it again or is it already trusted
jailbreak,not_removed,google extender but with the e being a
jailbreak,not_removed,no it does it all automagically you input your apple id and password in the settings pane
jailbreak,not_removed,e x t n d e r
jailbreak,not_removed,oh ya ik that lol i just wanted to know cause the way to test it makes you have to trust it again cause you know you have to delete the app to test lol
jailbreak,not_removed,hope he sees this before the mods do
jailbreak,not_removed,i didnt do that test i just let it run for the week and its worked twice now real world testing lol
jailbreak,not_removed,damn this makes me laugh so hard
jailbreak,not_removed,lol nice my only problem with it is you cant resign manually it seems you click on renew but nothing happens maybe a glitch
jailbreak,not_removed,just wait a long time i did and it ended up installing it
jailbreak,not_removed,oh so after i click renew button i just wait for awhile oh
jailbreak,not_removed,did you restore through itunes
jailbreak,not_removed,install cydia impactoreraser through cydia and run it to remove all traces of jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,if youre giving your phone back just dfu restore to ios
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont get your problem just do a fresh restore and update to
jailbreak,not_removed,verizon cares about one thing your bill and its payment they could give two shits but charge you for three about a jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,dfu mode restore threw itunes erase all contents and settings doesnt get rid of all jailbreak files
jailbreak,not_removed,google it
jailbreak,not_removed,i think you can turn off locationsiri suggestions etc to disable it but if you use flex try the following patch and report back if it works for you because i only tested it after two resprings
jailbreak,not_removed,manchester united haha try lockhtml you can customize your lockscreen
jailbreak,not_removed,lot of man u love nice to see
jailbreak,not_removed,man u 🙌
jailbreak,not_removed,hey let me take the opportunity to thank you for all the great effort you put into this
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah me too thanks for all the patches youve made
jailbreak,not_removed,youre welcome and thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,not done yet but i will have an upcoming tweak called hydrogen that is like my tweak only for the signal and wifi icons will have option to be able to combine the two into one icon with colors being the way to know what data your using will work with all current and future lithium ion themes as well youll see it on here when its coming
jailbreak,not_removed,bars changes it to bars

jailbreak,not_removed,yes of course
jailbreak,not_removed,is it possible to have this default when i pull down nc instead of swiping through today and notifications
jailbreak,not_removed,description requires ios not compatible with ipad ncapps allows you to quickly access an application from within a new notification center tab when first opened you will be presented with an option to select an app after an app is selected you can interact with it as you would if it were fully launched when closing the notification center ncapps will remember which app you last had open in its tab and reopen it next time you open it for quicker access if you do not want the app to be remembered close the app view before closing the notification center there is no extra battery consumption the app is not left running in the tab willy nilly when you close the notification center the app is backgrounded like it normally would be by the system no other options to configure
jailbreak,not_removed,any chance of having the option to select preferred apps scrolling through dozens of apps is not very appealing
jailbreak,not_removed,yes is back
jailbreak,not_removed,liking the tweak a lot however this doesnt work for me on locks screen is it possible to make this work on lock screen
jailbreak,not_removed,not working properly adds a number of apps it choosed random on nc and you cant change them
jailbreak,not_removed,oh theyre all there its sort of like an app drawer but on shuffle lol swipe the apps up they scroll
jailbreak,not_removed,scroll through the apps
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,op was obviously confused all user apps are available you just have to scroll through them
jailbreak,not_removed,lol really wtf cp is one of the few still contributing at this point
jailbreak,not_removed,nice job insulting one of the most talented and reliable tweak devs
jailbreak,not_removed,this jailbreak doesnt work on iphone its for bit devices only yours is bit
jailbreak,not_removed,you cannot jailbreak an iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,well boy doesnt that explain it thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,you can jailbreak the iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,the thread says
jailbreak,not_removed,hes wrong not surprisingly it pulls stats about your device so they can get paid why else release a jailbreak but it doesnt waste battery doing so
jailbreak,not_removed,okay guys so i saw icuid latest video and i know he is bs wrong hes bs allowing for his many many many duplicates if you want the cert its not a year see
jailbreak,not_removed,so is pp safer and in the end wont the enterprise cert get revoked its only a matter of time
jailbreak,not_removed,they are both equally safe the cert is already revoked but it employs some jailbreak fuckery to have the device inherently trust it anyway jus dont reverify it
jailbreak,not_removed,so everyone saying the english one is better id wrong should i keep my pp cert what cert you guys have sorry im just really paranoid about this
jailbreak,not_removed,if you have a day cert id keep that if you only have a day one you might as well use the english version
jailbreak,not_removed,total newbie how do i check cert i have i installed the chinese version activated on everything important and appleid doesnt share same credentials as anything important edit grammar
jailbreak,not_removed,did you keep the pp app the app store one
jailbreak,not_removed,go to settingsgeneralprofiles and check
jailbreak,not_removed,no i installed it and then deleted it it installs the day cert
jailbreak,not_removed,how did you install then delete
jailbreak,not_removed,just install it when you run the app for the first time then delete it through cydia
jailbreak,not_removed,symbolic links are kind of like special files but inside them their actual text tells you where the original actually is so if you look inside the symbolic link file you should be able to find where the actual folder got moved to if so then its a relatively simple matter to just move that folder back to where it originally was delete the symbolic link and then use the mv command or filza to move the folder back i mean thats my top of the head thinking about this definitely research to make sure that this is the right approach ive never done this before and im just thinking out loud but that being said it seems like this would solve it anyone more knowledgeable or experienced please chime in
jailbreak,not_removed,oh shit was it my advice
jailbreak,not_removed,this wouldnt work because my device has basically been restored but not completely restored user data has been cleared everything else you mentioned is correct though
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont remember whos it was one user provided me with his linguisticdata though so im checking if it works if i put these files in my linguisticdata folder
jailbreak,not_removed,you should note that itll take more space if youre moving it back
jailbreak,not_removed,i had to use the symbolic link still and place the linguistic data files where the symlink lead but now its all working after a reboot
jailbreak,not_removed,if i reset keyboard data would that help my system partition is at and my user partition is at i may actually link it back to systemlibrarylinguisticdata or i may just symlink it again ill let you know what i do and how it works out
jailbreak,not_removed,to my knowledge they do this from their side most likely not possible at least youre not having to pay extra and can still use the phone
jailbreak,not_removed,yah i had a feeling that would be the case thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,go to general battery and enable show battery percentage in status bar the battery and percentage is then also viewable in the status bar on the lockscreen with no tapping required
jailbreak,not_removed,i know that i use wink to hide my status bar so i only have to tap it when i want to see something
jailbreak,not_removed,swipeexpander maybe
jailbreak,not_removed,ikeywi
jailbreak,not_removed,i ikeywi for that extra row
jailbreak,not_removed,confirm
jailbreak,not_removed,ill check this out thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,everything you need comes preinstalled now security maybe icaughtu pro idk if its updated for ios but other than that youre fine
jailbreak,not_removed,did the time and date bug get fixed in that version if not brickdate on the bigboss repo
jailbreak,not_removed,if by security you mean malware just use the standard repos and ones you often see posted on here if by theft than you may want to check out icaughtu pro
jailbreak,not_removed,tweaks i use for securityprivacy reasons firewallip applocker minimal hosts blocker icaughtu pro protect my privacy brickingdate no pls recovery as long as this is installed restoring in itunes does not work dfumode does mikoto really helpful tool among other things it prevents accidentally pressing erase all content prevents someone other do this
jailbreak,not_removed,crash reporter
jailbreak,not_removed,did you downgrade by doing the shiftclick or optionclick update to ios from ios
jailbreak,not_removed,option click
jailbreak,not_removed,ok thats your problem when you downgrade from ios doing the optionclick update to ios method it causes some things to be corrupt like the music app so you only way to fix it is to preform a full restore through itunes
jailbreak,not_removed,you will need to go to cydia remove mobile substrate it will delete all your current tweaks and just simply reinstall it and you will have a fresh start then install icleaner pro if you want to clean some caches and junk files you had from your tweaks and itll clean your iphone overall
jailbreak,not_removed,how did you manage to get rid of the bootloop
jailbreak,not_removed,also download icleaner pro and delete all the deb files thatll make it work too
jailbreak,not_removed,semi on topic but what if per say someone wanted to competely delete cydia because they had errors that couldnt get fixed how would a person go about sideloading or using ssh or terminal or ifile to reinstall everything ive googled came up with unclear results on the process of wiping off cydia and reinstalling it after using the find my iphone trick and yes i know not a good method to use but lesson learned im just getting tired of seeing dpkg errors or unrar missing or gzip missing etc ill have to load a screen shot of what im experiencing but the whole deleting process began when i noticed stock apps and app store apps crashing non jailbreak detected apps at that anyways any help to fix cydia would be appreciated
jailbreak,not_removed,it kinda worked but i installed one tweak after i did what you said and all my previous tweaks came back in settings
jailbreak,not_removed,i used the find my iphone trick where you erase your phone through find my iphone then it restores to the firmware you had it on without updating it
jailbreak,not_removed,would you know how to do that
jailbreak,not_removed,so one possible way to clean this up would be if you knew exactly where those settings lived in the file system but thats not really such a great idea because other pieces of the tweaks could be lurking as well the cleanest way to deal with this situation i would think would be to install the two weeks that are showing up in settings and then deinstall them
jailbreak,not_removed,open icleaner click the plus button on button left delete preference files that will make the settings go away and do a clean up on the middle and make sure the cydia cydia sources and unused dependencies are checked that should fix your problem
jailbreak,not_removed,definitely go to ios
jailbreak,not_removed,there is a tool coming up soon to downgrade from to if i was you i would wait
jailbreak,not_removed,source
jailbreak,not_removed,source
jailbreak,not_removed,dont let this be the only reason to stay on because its highly unlikely it ever gets released to the public
jailbreak,not_removed,use photo organizer
jailbreak,not_removed,i cant answer most of the questions but as for question number i do recall reading about one tweak in particular sorry i dont remember its name that will allow you to exclude certain apps for showing up in the app switcher look around you should be able to find it good luck
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks my guy
jailbreak,not_removed,want this too
jailbreak,not_removed,took me seconds to find it on google ffs
jailbreak,not_removed,you want but i dont know if it works on ios

jailbreak,not_removed,my bad for not being so helpful tho
jailbreak,not_removed,we also got a telegram group if yall wanna join that too
jailbreak,not_removed,joined
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks emb the chat has been dead tbh
jailbreak,not_removed,can you join more than one slack group ive already joined one for my work would i have to have two separate instances of the app
jailbreak,not_removed,have you included this on rsideloaded sidebar
jailbreak,not_removed,any open slack groups available
jailbreak,not_removed,like upmmedickpictures said already a telegram channel with members but i guess always nice to have options
jailbreak,not_removed,isnt slack pretty much exactly the same thing as irc except with a shittier client
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks please spread the word so that more people can communicate through this chat
jailbreak,not_removed,yes you can hope to see you soon
jailbreak,not_removed,no because i wasnt sure if the other rsideloaded mods would have wanted to endorse the chat then again i never asked p
jailbreak,not_removed,you mean invites
jailbreak,not_removed,disagree on the shittier part slack is amazing
jailbreak,not_removed,its a closed source irc yup
jailbreak,not_removed,yes sir
jailbreak,not_removed,theres a telegram group as well i forgot to add it
jailbreak,not_removed,im talking about the clients specifically the windows client in particular is coded extremely badly almost like it was written in adobe air in fact while it was running in the background it appeared to jam up the fps of one of my games for seemingly no reason soon as i quit the client the game went back to irc at least has some decently written clients i like the plugin for miranda ng and apart from inline emoticons i honestly cant see the need to use slack at all over irc edit evidently the downvotes of my post must mean that the windows client is in fact coded splendidly my bad smh
jailbreak,not_removed,oh yeah i remember seeing the post for the sideloaded telegram group
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i wasnt terribly impressed by the mac client either but in browser and on iphone i cant complain which personally covers my needs
jailbreak,not_removed,by design the iphone will sync itunes content with one computer any attempt to sync such content with a second computer will result in all itunes content being first erased from your phone then replaced with the content from the second computer there are third party apps that get around this though for example touchcopy there are some other useful tips on how to get around this on apple support communites here
jailbreak,not_removed,good video helped me out a few weeks ago
jailbreak,not_removed,cool video i looked through it and couldnt find any fixes that apply to me you reckon you can help heres a description of my issue
jailbreak,not_removed,what about my case for instance i got read only cant install upgrade or remove tweaks httpmimgurcomqefmhgh and thanks for the tutorial video
jailbreak,not_removed,oh hey
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i did reboot went safe mode tried everything possible with no luck just want to know how to delete cydia if you dont mind
jailbreak,not_removed,remindme
jailbreak,not_removed,wow cool 👍🏼
jailbreak,not_removed,see boot loop not random reboots
jailbreak,not_removed,alright so ive look at your errors and it seems pretty serious i had this a little while back your filesystem has been corrupted either by tampering in the files or a tweaksource bad news is that video wont work for you because youre on ios but good news is you can backup and run cydia eraser which still works for ios that will completely reset everything except some tweak settings and make your phone like it was brand new use a backup to save your stuff i recommend itunes and restore it back after eraser is done working then once your stuff is back you can rejailbreak using pangu 😀 hope this helped
jailbreak,not_removed,i have the same problem
jailbreak,not_removed,strange it shouldnt be readonly since youre jailbroken assuming youve tried the rebooting rerunning yalu etc try the process in the vid at that should install a new cydia unfortunately your tweaks will be gone but you can reinstall those even rogue ones and fix that error
jailbreak,not_removed,you still got this issue
jailbreak,not_removed,try one more thing rejailbreak and hold down the vol plus button while rejailbreaking to boot into no substrate mode delete the tweak thats bothering u then reboot and dont hold any buttons to set how it worked out
jailbreak,not_removed,defaulted to one day i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
jailbreak,not_removed,hi thanks for the comment when i read in your youtube title all devices i interpreted that as any jailbroken phone didnt think of the ios version sorry good suggestion however i dont understand how i could install cydia eraser when all my sources are blank and i cant search for packages any advice thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,yes unfortunately
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for the help just forgot to mention that am running ios machportal when you jailbreak you already into no substrate mode it didnt work as well into no substrate mode
jailbreak,not_removed,hmm that is a problem id suspect you could patch it in with mterm but idk how that would go the fixability of the jb without eraser and cydia is virtually zero unless someone modified the pangu file like the yalu machportal files were
jailbreak,not_removed,my apologies i believe there is a way to delete cydia but i dont know where to find it😒
jailbreak,not_removed,thats fine thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,if you have terminal you can try running aptget remove purge cydia as root not sure if itll work but its worth a shot
jailbreak,not_removed,dont install since the jailbreak is in beta stashing will make it hard to update to the final when it comes out
jailbreak,not_removed,which version phantom lite you have
jailbreak,not_removed,works for me perfectly from his repo
jailbreak,not_removed,x activator make it so your passcode is bypassed when connected to specific wifi then icleaner wont ask for the passcode when it gets enabled by activator
jailbreak,not_removed,set activator to unlock phone before icleaner
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackagecomcpdigitaldarkroomsmartpass bigboss tweaks no passcode needed in certain situations beep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,stack the commands in activator you have it set to auto clean at so add a second pause or something and put wifi off switch on that same gesture
jailbreak,not_removed,nope in this case you probably need its activator action to bypass password
jailbreak,not_removed,let me know if this was what you needed
jailbreak,not_removed,glad i could be useful
jailbreak,not_removed,no
jailbreak,not_removed,no but i can find the offsets for you
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,can you download the bmssm app and go to the system tab in the bmssm app and tell me what model you have
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks because ipad wifi gsm and global arent documented which chip is in them that i could find im lazy there probably is
jailbreak,not_removed,i already found them thanks anyway i had no idea there were more offsets
jailbreak,not_removed,do they work
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i already did the jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,can you compare them to the ones i found i know the second to last one is probably wrong
jailbreak,not_removed,i used this ones
jailbreak,not_removed,found them here
jailbreak,not_removed,im still confused on how to get the second to last offset because its easy to find in ios but its different in ios and not described well by jk
jailbreak,not_removed,what disassembler are you using httpshopperappcom or httpswwwhexrayscomproductsida
jailbreak,not_removed,fixed it flex tweak that messed with my camera app
jailbreak,not_removed,what is your model ios version jailbroken status
jailbreak,not_removed,see if dictation works
jailbreak,not_removed,does it work ok in safe mode
jailbreak,not_removed,ios jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,hmm yeah its working in safe mode
jailbreak,not_removed,probably jailbreak related
jailbreak,not_removed,its jailbreak related try disabling tweaks by icleaner pro to see the tweak causing your problem
jailbreak,not_removed,aq
jailbreak,not_removed,yes and its working in safe mode
jailbreak,not_removed,datameter
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,you can usually call up your provider and ask them to put a cap on it i have and have done for years
jailbreak,not_removed,it might be cheaper for you to just get an unlimited data plan no i have it here in the uk and use about a week minimum
jailbreak,not_removed,ok guys this is a genuine request and a fair one too android has the ability to help limit data usage and set a hard cap while i dont know of any tweaks that can do this i think op deserves some genuine replies
jailbreak,not_removed,sounds like you need wifi an unlimited plan or
jailbreak,not_removed,unfortunately not unless someone else knows but your iphone has a nifty setting to limit data usage its called the off switch great for batterylife also
jailbreak,not_removed,im fairly certain theres a tweak that shuts off your data after a certain amount has been used but i cant tell you the name of it
jailbreak,not_removed,self control could not find info about this tweaktheme bleep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,directly directly from his twitter account actual exploit does nothing but give you readwriteinfoleak arbitrary js object primitives have fun what that means is beyond me
jailbreak,not_removed,hello thank you for your participation in rjailbreak however your submission was removed for the following reasons not jailbreak related if you have any questions about this removal please feel free to
jailbreak,not_removed,that means incompletion
jailbreak,not_removed,i like how youre thinking the idea of jailbreaking my and doing wild things with it sounds fun just like those things people do with their jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,the exploit allows people like u and me to make codes that can be executed another developer still needs to make the code able to do cool stuff like the substrate and tweak equivalent for the ps os
jailbreak,not_removed,or maybe a tweak that helps you filter out results on cydia based on comparability
jailbreak,not_removed,as we know in most cases the people who screw up this way is because they have installed pirated versions tweaks on default repos will give a warning stating your ios is not supported and thus prevent you from purchasing downloading the pirate repos do not provide the same restrictions and hence why some users get caught out
jailbreak,not_removed,no but us developers need to approve purchases on each ios update so you cant purchase something that isnt completely operational on the ios you are looking for depending on what changes happened in ios update the tweak might be fine theres some free tweaks from ios that work with ios perfectly finding which ones is the fun with jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,i mean im using tweaks for ios fine on my device running ios
jailbreak,not_removed,this
jailbreak,not_removed,this so much
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,finding which ones is the fun with jailbreak found the reason half this sub has lost their jailbreak just joking bro just joking youre very helpful to this sub
jailbreak,not_removed,you can
jailbreak,not_removed,from what ive found the process of updating patches changes some most of the files on your phone while leaving some partiallyjailbroken this has the potential to cause problems in the future because you arent cleaning up the mess the jailbreak causes on your phone whereas restoring completely removes all remnants of the jailbreak making your phone run more effectively in the longterm plus apple shouldnt be able to determine that youve ever jailbroken your phone which is nice for support requests nonetheless you can indeed update your phone to remove your jailbreak its just not recommended
jailbreak,not_removed,i feel like if i encounter any problems in the future then that is when ill restore i didnt really install too many tweaks that would mess things up
jailbreak,not_removed,certainly but is there any particular reason as to why youd want to update over restoring from an ipsw then your backup just like how much time it takes which can be a lot lol
jailbreak,not_removed,an itunes update flashes the system partition where the vast majority of a jailbreak lives including cydia with the traditional stashing of all previous jailbreaks updating would waste a few hundred mb of storage space but thats not the case with the latest pangu update away
jailbreak,not_removed,great thanks this was very helpful
jailbreak,not_removed,happened to me as well i couldnt find the reason
jailbreak,not_removed,i lost songs about a week ago still dont know how it happened
jailbreak,not_removed,happened to me all the time back on dont worry about re syncing
jailbreak,not_removed,have you used icleaner because back in ios i had songs in the music app and when i use it it deletes all of them since it hoards data and space thats the time i stopped using musicapp and used another app
jailbreak,not_removed,happened to me too today after updating uasharedtools
jailbreak,not_removed,happened to me last night i woke up went to play music and it was all gone i checked my storage i went from to i resprang and my music is back on the cloud but none of it is downloaded
jailbreak,not_removed,im thinking about unjailbreaking
jailbreak,not_removed,yea wtf im thinking about unjailbreaking
jailbreak,not_removed,i tried resyncing and nothing happened also the gigs of music i had before transferred into the other section
jailbreak,not_removed,what app do you use now
jailbreak,not_removed,yea wtf i still havent found a solution
jailbreak,not_removed,lol
jailbreak,not_removed,idl or idownloader its one of those normal downloading songs and stuff plus i dont use musicapp
jailbreak,not_removed,why why would you want too why is it so important cap whore
jailbreak,not_removed,theres a flex patch for this courtesy of usinfool solving the worlds problems one patch at a time if you dont use flex you should check it out beta is currently free on the devs repo httpgetdeltaco
jailbreak,not_removed,you could turn off app store notifications and just update apps individually
jailbreak,not_removed,looks like you could be using app admin so why dont you just block all updates for the app youre not looking to update
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for the mention
jailbreak,not_removed,really horseshoe glad i read this sorry to hear bro hope someone can help you people are currently testing downgrading from with prometheus so there is that
jailbreak,not_removed,did you install appsync
jailbreak,not_removed,unfortunately no the signing windows for is already closed edit you can restore to but you will lose your jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,then you can go ahead to restore to if its not detected to itunes bring the phone to recovery mode regrading downgrade thats the plan from the creator of the prometheus as long as you have blobs you will be able to downgrade however he is still working for a patch for it tldr you cant downgrade atm
jailbreak,not_removed,bring your iphone to recovery mode as mentioned previously it can be done by pressing power vol down for or power home button for older devices for seconds here is the method else you can check youtube for clearer demonstration good luck
jailbreak,not_removed,you can use but you wont get the latest version with that only one that can work on your ios version
jailbreak,not_removed,currently have an iphone on snapchat works perfectly fine for me as for instagram i dont think theres a way around it since it requires newer apis
jailbreak,not_removed,ugh this is so frustrating am i able to upgrade to a newer jailbreak ios jailbreak or i dont want to be on this anymore want newer version jailbrak
jailbreak,not_removed,if you cant download an app because its not compatible download the ipa through itunes use to extract the infoplist file move it to your iphone and open the file with ifile there you are supposed to find something like minimumosi dont remember change the value from xx to get the file back to your pc and use again to replace the original infoplist with yours install it profit it will not work if the app actually needs the ios frameworks
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackagecomunlimappsuaupdatetools bigboss free tweaks downgrade apps to any previous version no appsync needed hi mom type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,that doesnt always work what u can do is buy the app with itunes then go to appstore on your phone purchased and download it from the cloud from there its going to download the latest app that is compatible with your ios with out appadmin
jailbreak,not_removed,thats what im saying if it actually uses the ios frameworks it wont workbut i guess this could be useful if he wants to install an app which initial version needed ios
jailbreak,not_removed,u dont say someone else already posted that btw
jailbreak,not_removed,i didnt but i agree with him also i didnt say that i posted it
jailbreak,not_removed,i mean someone else on reddit posted this tweet
jailbreak,not_removed,taking a long time to drop a pencil
jailbreak,not_removed,loll
jailbreak,not_removed,they are the type of people to have to make their own pencil before they can drop it
jailbreak,not_removed,no you can not its been said on this subreddit
jailbreak,not_removed,what tweak did you use to set the background color in the first place
jailbreak,not_removed,i did unjb once before and rejbed now currrently i set every other nc background related tweaks offdefault i tried few tweaks one by one to change nc background colors and none worked i have nc colors and springtomize at the moment
jailbreak,not_removed,disable any tweak you think is causing the issue with the nc color via icleaner one by one to find out which one is causing it it has to be one of your current tweaks double check all your customization tweaks to make sure you forgot a setting somewhere
jailbreak,not_removed,do you know itunes do this automatically also i see many people dont know this trick to backup all ipa on ios without redownload them since with ios itunes dont backup installed app and need to redownload them on pc just upload all the app folder on your pc open itunes open your apps library then drag and drop the app folder into the itunes apps library windows and tadaa itunes make the ipa and add it directly in your library also you can save the ipa etc etc the only thing and i dont know why itunes dont pack the itunesartwork and itunesmetadataplist into the ipa you will not have the artwork on the icon app but its not a problem because it works without them personally if the plist is really needed for an app i restore it directly in the app folder or add it manually in the ipa with
jailbreak,not_removed,you went through the stress of getting the chinese characters in the title right gotta give you credit for that one
jailbreak,not_removed,this method seems to not save the purchase date and illustration itunes still says the application was purchased i used and sshed to the iphone ipainstaller b comazazdribbble created the file privatevarmobiledocumentspgdribbble comazazdribbble with this file itunes displays the illustration purchase date the complete title pg client a better client for dribbble developer name
jailbreak,not_removed,the app itself still in the apple server i just downloaded it a minute ago
jailbreak,not_removed,copytrans also has saving the ipa
jailbreak,not_removed,look my video and download my tool i put the pp ipa inside
jailbreak,not_removed,this method is useless u need to either appsync or impactor appsync is useless as well be unjailed after a reboot
jailbreak,not_removed,if you downloaded it two days ago from the appstore it will forever be in your purchase history anyway this post is not helping anyone edit downvote me all you like this method wont work if you used someone else account and if you downloaded it with your own it will be in your purchase history either way this post is useless and spreads misinformation at the time of this edit sheep already upvoted this shitpost this goes to show the level of stupid in this sub

jailbreak,not_removed,i cant find it
jailbreak,not_removed,if its from your phone with your icloud account you can sync it with itunes if its mikeys it wont work unless you log into mikeys account on itunes on your computer when you want to sync it
jailbreak,not_removed,apple can remove the app from their servers
jailbreak,not_removed,seems the level of stupid just rose a bit with your comment sheepy sheepy
jailbreak,not_removed,apple usually doesnt but actually can pull it from their servers the modmyi app is the one example that comes to mind immediately it was pulled due to its jailbreak related content and no longer in peoples purchased section personally i backed up the ipa but plenty of people who didnt are often asking about this in mmi forums why mmi doesnt at least upload it to their cydia repo is beyond me
jailbreak,not_removed,ive been wondering if after you enter the password for the first time to unlock the ipa file does that information get stored anywhere so we can back it up then after using cydia eraser later and rejailbreaking with impactor we can copy that data back and not have to use his password again or does it work some other way for example if you install a regular unencrypted ipa file with ifunbox from your friends account it will ask you for their apple id password only once from that point on you can update it along with your own apps where is that password stored
jailbreak,not_removed,lol go delete it from your device fully and try install it from itunes you will find that while you can put it on your phone it wont work it will just crash
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i dont doubt it but i spent hours yesterday trying to find a work around to backup the ipa i even tried modifying the files inside the app to tie it to my apple id i could get it to save to itunes and my desktop and i could even get it to install back on my phone however when you run it it just crashes it might be possible if you used your own apple id to grab it in the first place but if anyone used mikeybs login like me it wont work also mikeyb has closed and locked the account everyone used so yeah if anyone has found a way to do it i suggest they delete it fully from their phone then install it from itunes reboot to a non jailbroken state try running the app if it works which it wont unless they used their own apple id and get back to us like i said i spent the best part of yesterday trying to get around it to no avail
jailbreak,not_removed,no entering the apple id and pass in app wont work u need to login in app store with the same apple id and then install ipa thats how it works
jailbreak,not_removed,that sucks i did download it using my own account will back it up but wont likely ever use it unless my original pangu app fails for some reason personally i dont see what all the fuss is about since a year certificate is more than adequate for now and id imagine when the year is almost up pangu will provide another one im no expert on this stuff but if they have to come up with a new certificate once a year i cant see that being a problem
jailbreak,not_removed,not true i have two itunes accounts in different names when i install an app downloaded from one account onto the other phone and open the app a window comes up asking for the password for the apple id that downloaded it ive had those apps on the other phone for over a year and continue to update them while logged back into the other account and have never been asked since i also downloaded the pg client ipa file from mikeys account and copied it to other phones myself already and opened the app and entered the password and jailbroke the other phones so dont tell me thats not how it works install any app your friend bought using ifunbox then open the app and youll be asked to login to itunes type in your friends password and use the app go try it for yourself if you dont believe me i bought several games for myself on my girlfriends account a few years ago so we can both use them in fact i just updated one of hers thats still on my phone last week without being prompted for a password if you know where the data is stored speak up otherwise i dont care youre not going to convince me something doesnt work when i just did it edit
jailbreak,not_removed,dont worry mate you can also use the date trick if it comes to it come april simply set the date back a few days re trust the certificate run the jailbreak then after jailbroken set the date back to normal so there is no need for anyone to panic plus ios should have a jaikbreak by then too
jailbreak,not_removed,i ran into a problem at one point where i couldnt verify the pangu app but i reinstalled it made sure to follow every step more carefully think i mightve missed one the time around also installed a flex patch that supposedly solves certificate issues including one where year certs were failing to verify so hopefully that wont happen again i could still be on in a year but i dont see it being a problem if so usually i hesitate to jump on major updates in favor of more stable versions like staying on until released stayed at until so unless ios is undeniably stable and jailbroken i could be part of the minority who is still on in a year
jailbreak,not_removed,well i dont plan on locking my other account so i dont imagine it ever being a problem but if its not your account like i said the phone is already authorized to use the ipa so it wont ask for a password again just going on that fact im going to go with as long as you never delete the app youll be fine next time i see an update on my phone from the other account ill change the password first and see if im still able to update the app then ill let you know for sure have a nice day
jailbreak,not_removed,only problem with that it you cant run flex from a non jailbroken state if for some reason you needed a replacement device you wont be able to use it see what i mean if you get booted out of jailbroken mode and you are relying on a flex patch your gonna run into big troubles
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i really dont understand how the flex patch works and was skeptical that it would help but figured it couldnt hurt strange that it was under springboard too rather than systemwide or settings in any case i should be all set anyways since i followed every step exactly this time around i think the first time i didnt verify before opening the pangu app worst case scenario its easy enough to reinstall the app if both pangu and pg client fail which is extremely unlikely
jailbreak,not_removed,what ios are you on if your on ios theres is fixes for this just search the sub for lte fix for ios
jailbreak,not_removed,ios great ill look
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you so much for your help its fixed
jailbreak,not_removed,no problem youre welcome
jailbreak,not_removed,try leaving it on charge overnight then try a soft reset by holding both the power and home button for around seconds nothing worse than a grumpy misses man lol hope it works for you if you can get it to boot id be checking the battery capacity just in case it needs a new one
jailbreak,not_removed,could be storage issue some people on here have said that the phone will boot loop if the storage if completely full also i dont think you should take the blame for this people shouldnt be ignoring the storage almost full popups its there fault if they choose to dismiss the message and not do anything about it
jailbreak,not_removed,i had the same pop up a month ago panicked a bit but searching the web resulting in nothing i suppose it has to do with the pangu profile i already had a digit code and it had been the same for a time i changed it and since then my phone hasnt complained
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont have any pirated tweaks or repos on my phone but i did recently install reflectrix i didnt change my passcode though i just resprung and it went away
jailbreak,not_removed,thats apple trying you to change your password to a better one got one of this pop up even before i was jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,do you have tweak install my phone started doing that when i install that tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,i got this prompt after i was locking and unlocking my phone many times in succession i suspect the phone thinks someone is messing with it when all i was doing was trying different lock screen wallpapers
jailbreak,not_removed,my guess is a profile you installed under settingsgeneralprofilesdevice management mdm profiles usually cause this and ive experienced this on my school ipad too
jailbreak,not_removed,this
jailbreak,not_removed,its to do with a profile you have installed

jailbreak,not_removed,the only profile i have is the pangu one
jailbreak,not_removed,if your passcode is then change it to i think apple nerfed something idk could also be a scam from a phishing website clear history and data from safari if you can all i know is its not reflectrix
jailbreak,not_removed,yea i didnt think it could be reflectrix either but i did clear my safari and resprung which got rid of it

jailbreak,not_removed,patience young grasshopper we too are waiting for the mighty pangu to drop us the gift from the servers of the high heavens
jailbreak,not_removed,i crossed my fingers hoping my had it but wss bummed a bit when it had on it no big deal for a first time iphone user still a lot more stable than android was for me ill just stay patiently awaiting a jailbreak like others do its only smaller dislikes i have since i cant customise like i did before my main reason for thus phablet anyways was to browse the web comfortably without samsungs screens where i ended up with screen burn phones in a row while im thinking about it what ad blockers are you guys using just want to get rid of ads in safari and apps on android some websites could detect you using them and block you if you are using them is that still the case using iphone ad blockers
jailbreak,not_removed,tired of being nice i assume that this means your doing the work yourself instead of waiting for others to do it for you

jailbreak,not_removed,nobody knows when
jailbreak,not_removed,well thats very likely not true at all anyone who is working on a jailbreak or who is close to people working on a jailbreak would have a reasonable idea when i think you likely mean that you dont know when and most people dont
jailbreak,not_removed,well even people who are making it wouldnt as its not possible to work out what could go wrong theyd have a better idea than most people though however chance you wont get a reply from any of them
jailbreak,not_removed,well and thats kinda what i am getting at it seems like this time around there is just nothing no leaks no suggestions no indications nothing
jailbreak,not_removed,there never is real news though pangutaig just announce when the release and thats it

jailbreak,not_removed,no i got yesterday
jailbreak,not_removed,no honestly i only have about or
jailbreak,not_removed,delete it and see what happens
jailbreak,not_removed,i honestly couldnt live without this tweak it sets a small delay before you send a text so if you notice a typo before it sends you quickly fix it
jailbreak,not_removed,allows you to crop screenshots as you take them and move them around your screen such a good tweak that im not sure why apple hasnt implemented this into default ios
jailbreak,not_removed,free version of springtomize basically possibly has some extra features
jailbreak,not_removed,lets you swipe across your keyboard to move the text cursor by far my most missed tweak when i dont have a jailbroken device

jailbreak,not_removed,musicalkeyboard play music every time you type
jailbreak,not_removed,move the cursor with a swipe of the keyboard one finger not that two finger crap apple implemented the very first tweak i install after a new jb every single time
jailbreak,not_removed,from the bigboss repo shortens or eliminates ui animations for me its the single most important tweak that i use
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,why was this downvoted anyways the tweak name reswitch repo what it does swipe down any app card to relaunch the app why you should download it if an app for example pokemon go freezes you can easily relaunch it and you can use it to evolve more pokemon doing the evolution glitch
jailbreak,not_removed,hides pretty much any annoying ui element you can think of

jailbreak,not_removed,ok ok i couple i dont see yet flame make cydia yours customize cydia and allow copy paste options ect thats how i copied the tweak here httpcydiasaurikcompackagecomaditkamathflame preferenceorganizer organises your settings app into toggleable and renamable categories system apps social networking apps tweaks and app store apps httpcydiaangelxwindnet igotya basically icaughtupro but i tried both and this one works better u can download it free and try it for a week or two if u lose your phone or just have friends trying to break in it takes a picture of the person sends u the pic location and sends them a message httpilocaliscomrepo minimal hosts blocker this blocks countless ads for me i never get an ad on almost every app im on httpreddestdreamgithubio eclipse ios most people know about this but its my absolute fav tweak because it makes your phone look different from any stock iphone i think better then any other tweak traverse create custom actions for apps i used this to create touch shortcuts for the jailbreak subreddit as well as some others you can put a shortcut on any app these are just some i thought id mention which i use everyday
jailbreak,not_removed,messagecustomizer dark bubbles and white letters for sms and ims
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,adds at the top of the keyboard a fourth row of customizable keys a huge time saver for chatting specially for non english speakers that care about grammar
jailbreak,not_removed,saves me everyday it allows you to customize every alarm has activator actions to eneable all alarms for example and the best thing is that you can set the alarm to give you a calculation to stop the alarm you can choose the difficulty this makes the ios keyboard much more useful and it makes writing on the iphone so much faster these are my favorite tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,places a customisable assistivetouch button on the screen similar to the default version found in accessibility settings but with greater flexibility and allowing for faster use of toggles you can customise the toggles to include the actions or switches you need as well as change its appearance found it particularly useful on larger devices for toggling reachability taking screenshots or switching to the previous app

jailbreak,not_removed,i downloaded dim for free from bigboss
jailbreak,not_removed,what is it and dim is free btw
jailbreak,not_removed,this is the thing i miss most now that im on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,yup
jailbreak,not_removed,yup ive used it on and currently on
jailbreak,not_removed,i mean the delay is adjustable i dont think seconds is too long to wait
jailbreak,not_removed,you really shouldnt look at reddit for improvements in grammar fluent english speakers like myself fuck up their grammar a shit ton there are multiple ways to use commas but i dont think ops way is grammatically correct edit you dont need to use a coordinator after a semicolon as the semicolon takes its place
jailbreak,not_removed,are you talking about having it before basically because yes that is correct but only in certain circumstances a better way to write that sentence is basically a free version of springtomize
jailbreak,not_removed,long press
jailbreak,not_removed,actually correction it installs but not working atm i am pretty sure i had it working at one point my device has been buggy lately so that could be part of it
jailbreak,not_removed,not messages but ig and fb yes
jailbreak,not_removed,oh absolutely bloard is one of the first tweaks i download every time ive had it since ios
jailbreak,not_removed,that a euphemism
jailbreak,not_removed,i actually got crashes to safe mode from hidemex for ios when i tried it a few months ago have you ran into that
jailbreak,not_removed,may i ask what the purpose of this tweak is or why people like it not saying its bad just dont understand why the cursor lagging behind a little is something people want
jailbreak,not_removed,its nice to have a thread like this once in a while as it acts as a sort of refresher tweaks become outdated and are sometimes superseded as new ones are introduced
jailbreak,not_removed,i have one that plays coming home with a springboard dance to match when connected to wifi and when i drop my phone
jailbreak,not_removed,first download traverse go under my actions title your shortcut mine is called jailbreak next fill in the following the bundle id should be comredditreddit the url scheme should be redditredditcomrjailbreak you can replace jailbreak with any subreddit had to figure this out myself because it was not on the web leme know if you got it

jailbreak,not_removed,what is the repo
jailbreak,not_removed,i assume its a command you run in a terminal to have the same effect dim provides
jailbreak,not_removed,whoops my fault i was told it is a paid tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,sweet i appreciate the semicolon tip im constantly trying to find ways to not type like an idiot lol i know i shouldnt use reddit as a guide in grammar but this is one of the smarter forums i use
jailbreak,not_removed,that makes more sense to me i think i understand better now its little things like this that i should have learned in school
jailbreak,not_removed,nope latest hidemex for update from the developers repo works flawlessly on

jailbreak,not_removed,commas are difficult and they differ from britaincanada to us english my favourite comma is the oxford comma which is incorrect in canada my home country but proper in british english

jailbreak,not_removed,fyi oxford comma is placed prior to an and in a list ie the colours are red blue and green
jailbreak,not_removed,did you try icleaner also it looks like its not draining any battery at all so its nothing to worry about edited as i didnt finish reading before i typed laughed when i saw picture
jailbreak,not_removed,you even checked in cydia and your installed tweaks well if you did then just look around normal storage and all that and see if you can try to delete it from there edit oh and you know where to look for your apps in ifile right
jailbreak,not_removed,i tried icleaner that didnt clear it out i just noticed my battery started draining faster havent added any tweaks recently and this popped up saw it ate up of my battery so started trying to find out how to remove it since my daughters game is no longer on there lol
jailbreak,not_removed,yep checked all that ran out of ideas thats why i posted it on here seeing if anyone else had any ideas
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont think it should be draining anything really id recommend a reboot but im scared to lose jailbreak on mine so i try not to reboot at all
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah tried the reboot after i saw it hoping to see it eventually disappear if i could find it in ifile i would delete it just dont know where to look ive ran a search and even a search wont find it
jailbreak,not_removed,keep refreshing your sources you cleaned sources using icleaner
jailbreak,not_removed,same here happens from yesterday
jailbreak,not_removed,refresh and wait for them to be finished if that doesnt work try rebooting then refresh
jailbreak,not_removed,i had this issue turned out it was the new cydia had a bug install an earlier version from here httpaptsaurikcomdebs and downgrade cydia then when u get your debs showing again upgrade cydia installer deb from in cydia
jailbreak,not_removed,you need jailbreak and ifile installed to do this
jailbreak,not_removed,i have been refreshing them all morning and it has not fixed the issue anything else i can do
jailbreak,not_removed,trust me ive done this multiple times throughout the day and still have not worked thank you for your input though
jailbreak,not_removed,could you explain to me how i would go about doing this sorry for late response thanks for your help
jailbreak,not_removed,there is currently no alternative to cfa afaik it uses btstack because it cant use the regular bt connection the issue is that btstack cant be on at the same time as regular bt so keeping a watch connected is impossible you should be able to reconnect the watch after btstack switches off and regular bt kicks back in but that process has been unstable for awhile now
jailbreak,not_removed,cfa works fine with my jailbreak using a pro rather than a controller though
jailbreak,not_removed,me too i wanted to know this as well have you tried btstack
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i know found out the hard way even after i force off btstack and go into settings and manually connect to the apple watch it says connected the watch refuses to acknowledge the phone i have to enter unjailbroken mode and fully erase and re setup the watch all over again every time then it works and emulators forget about it the emulator opens and stutters at roughly fps and is completely unplayable and when you close the game bang respring straight into safe mode every time i wish the dev would fix cfa or btstack whichever is the culprit the only game ive found that runs with a controller is gta and even then connection from the remote is like hit miss
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah it comes as part of the cfa installation i dont believe cfa can run without it but not sure if cfa or btstack is causing the conflicts one of these two tweaks is causing havoc with my phone and renders the apple watch useless even when you try force these tweaks off the phone wont talk to watch properly with them installed also emulators that run perfectly fine run like shit when i enable cfa and then causes a respring when i close out of the emulator or mfi enabled app like gta
jailbreak,not_removed,commcenter crashes for me sometimes iphone completely unresponsive hard reset rejailbreak is the only thing that i know that works
jailbreak,not_removed,i have this problem phone wont respond to power on for around mins then the screen will pop on with the power down view i was out of data so i thought it was probably a tweak with drm trying to phone home sometimes the phone will respring after this aswell i did uninstall itouchsecure and photoalbums not sure if the issue was fixed or not by doing this
jailbreak,not_removed,anyone else have lockhtml maybe that could be it
jailbreak,not_removed,got precisely the same ive tried disabling many tweaks but to no avail
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,lockhtml definitely caused problems for me when i did have it installed theres a beta repo with newer versions you could try httprepolockhtmlcom
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont have that tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,same
jailbreak,not_removed,happened to me too

jailbreak,not_removed,you arent the only one
jailbreak,not_removed,ios jailbreak should come out before ios jailbreak but the only people who know what will happen are the jailbreak development teams not us users follow twitter panguteam taigjailbreak obviously the second a jailbreak is released rjailbreak will have a post about it no reason to ask a its not secretly released this is why i posted this the other day
jailbreak,not_removed,ios is far more likely to be jailbroken as the jailbreak teams are now focussing on ios as its the latest major ios version
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you for the response this is pretty much the exact answer i was looking for im still new to this sub so i apologize for the misuse of thanks again for your reply
jailbreak,not_removed,this but we have learned in the past when pangu released that it is always best to stay on the lowest firmware possible
jailbreak,not_removed,are you suggesting i stay with my current os im interested to hear your opinion
jailbreak,not_removed,when everyone was waiting for the jailbreak i was still on and everyone was saying stay as low as possible so thats what i did and in march a jailbreak came out just for so i was very lucky in my experience its always best to stay on the lowest firmware
jailbreak,not_removed,you cannot pair without ios if it is watchos if it is the oldest release it works with ios but most likely you have a later one you will have to update
jailbreak,not_removed,dont update i did the same shit for my apple watch i took it back the next day and am now not jailbroken it blows
jailbreak,not_removed,update its worth it a working apple watch is better than a jailbreak in my personal opinion
jailbreak,not_removed,can i downgrade the watch firmware
jailbreak,not_removed,until your crack the screen ofc happened to me in april never wearing it again so much for my jailbreak lost it on dec
jailbreak,not_removed,no you cant even dfu it
jailbreak,not_removed,how do you manage to crack a sapphire screen of something that only sits on your wrist
jailbreak,not_removed,it was the sport which has crappier screen material you could bash the screen drop it whilst putting it on personally i was taking it downstairs when i dropped it
jailbreak,not_removed,its day i didnt think it would happen to me but thats what they always think the worst of the withdrawals is over i hope being subscribed to riosthemes was torture but i didnt have the willpower to look away with every new setup post that i scrolled upon a single teardrop crawled down my left cheek its salt reminding me of the emptiness i continue to endure as the days go by without any sign of moving forward
jailbreak,not_removed,username checks out
jailbreak,not_removed,the firmware is pretty stable and honestly stability wise there is nothing to complain about however the withdrawals for a jailbreak is tense i miss jail breaking my device and using my device to the fullest still checking rjailbreak everyday
jailbreak,not_removed,horrible i can barely cellphone
jailbreak,not_removed,its been boring as hell man stock os is plain and dull but hey at least its stable right ugh
jailbreak,not_removed,it sounds like a drug withdrawal to me you guys need some help from the devs
jailbreak,not_removed,well on my camera app was working only of the time my phone had very laggy animations safari crashing constantly now its very smooth i was really surprised with the difference i do miss a lot though stock ios just isnt enough
jailbreak,not_removed,fucking shitty as hell
jailbreak,not_removed,i would be dying if i didnt have activator let alone any other tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,asked and answered yesterday
jailbreak,not_removed,first big thank you to pangu and all tweak developers i fully support i would not be an iphone user if it was not for jailbreaking i have rocked my for over two years and am ready and excited to get the new fancy but i refuse to get it until i can jb it for me the single thing i cannot live without is i have used it since ios i have a legacy unlimited data plan from verizon and jb for tethering for work i did the math once and that alone pays for a brand new device in months verizon wants something like extra per month for tethering and then a bazillion more so i can get enough bandwidth for work i often work remotely on the road at cafes and hotels and prefer to never use public wifi i use anywhere from to gb monthly the useability things i dont have to have but i dont want to live without are i have many usability and connivence actions i simply cannot live without turn that treble down any other device feels painfully slow i refuse to go back i block adds on my laptop so naturally also on my phone i can block hide app store updates and use older flex patches that still work various flipswitches such as i love this tweak and refuse to live without customizing my control center fixes older apps i use for work that dont expand to the height of my screen because my only has and im often at large marketing events without anyway to transfer media to clear up space i also have disabled many boot daemons i dont use unlock straight to my most used apps love this update rootmobile passwords for security and use my laptops filezilla to manage my file system as i store my own manually organized in my own folders and use filza file manager to play all my music because screw itunes and the default music player and my device changing all my file names i not only use this to search google from anywhere but it works as a nice place to transcribe text from the screen to then copy to clipboard for use elsewhere the best these greatly helped me type this reply the home button on my old died so i use virtualhome to lightly tap my button to cut down on the number of cycles of the button also great for ninja purposes download work product demonstration videos and show them to customers while out in remote locations without cell service additional send videos to my parents on how to use their idevices easier on my eyes for countless reasons including hiding apps i dont use such as the music player mentioned above because its a mess in there sometimes i dont want a flash but need a bit more light faster browsing experience no more unannoying volume changes this one doesnt work perfectly did one of the many solutions finally get updated for smaller notifications i resize halfway between my and a resolution for more screen realestate without being too hard to see load a few websites the way i want ive got another dozen or so but i can live without them as they are cosmeticappearance related i have fully paid for all tweaks as i greatly appreciate the improvement to my device that these developers have provided i have money in my bank account ready for a i will go straight to my local apple store the moment is jailbroken edit added doublelinebreaks for readability
jailbreak,not_removed,i use it to customise my homescreen and add widgets add another column of icons add more icons to my dock just a lot of theming in general but i also use tweaks like asphaleia swipeexpander swipeselection and other functional tweaks so adding features and theming essentially
jailbreak,not_removed,getting features available on android getting straight up jailbreakonly features getting features from newer iphones on my improving existing apps themes being able to trick spotify into thinking my phone is an ipad so im not limited to shuffle play
jailbreak,not_removed,for
jailbreak,not_removed,i hate the stock control center polus is a big reason for low power mode and location services in it and harbor betterfivecolumnhomescreen bioprotect anchor youtube speedintensifer swipeselection to name a few aesthetic and functional ones i really like
jailbreak,not_removed,more than anything else removing the icon labels haha
jailbreak,not_removed,for tweaks like callbar messages for ios n and lockbrowser i also enjoy visual stuff so i will always install anemone as well and ive gotten addicted to having weather on my ls so i have lockpluslockhtml and forecast for the animations
jailbreak,not_removed,ive posted this before my main reasons to not update besides aesthetic control because map links still open in apple maps no thanks i prefer google maps because i hate getting notifications for obvious stuff like airplane mode being on when i go to safari or mail making it so that the camera and screenshot never makes a shutter sound because my keyboard still gets stuck open sometimes with no way to make it go away feature to kill all apps or to turn on low power mode theres a lot of other apps and features i really like but its these little things that drive me crazy

jailbreak,not_removed,what do those tweaks do im assuming the app blocker isnt for safari but iads
jailbreak,not_removed,just all ads in general
jailbreak,not_removed,change the ipsw extension to zip unzip the file and then youre going to be able to browse the contents to find it edit heres the one i extracted when the beta went up httpiimgurcompfvwuaijpg
jailbreak,not_removed,you can just download it with internet explorer if you dont feel like changing it to zip yes ie is so bad that it wont even download ipsws correctly
jailbreak,not_removed,whenever i extract it only find disk image files inside it do i need to mount these
jailbreak,not_removed,yikes it doesnt even keep the ipsw
jailbreak,not_removed,yup inside of that will look a lot like the filesystem on your device
jailbreak,not_removed,what tool do i use to mount it ive tried poweriso with no luck
jailbreak,not_removed,ok so i was able to get in using transmac in which directory are the wallpapers stores
jailbreak,not_removed,i cant log on since the update dropped
jailbreak,not_removed,no but when i try to log in it says the servers are undergoing maintenance i checked to see if the servers are down and theyre not
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i did get an option saying to sign out at first and then relogged back in without problems i do see that servers are slow though
jailbreak,not_removed,works fine for me
jailbreak,not_removed,when you launch the game does it prompt you to make a new account ive seen other posts with that also
jailbreak,not_removed,im on and its working smoothly for me which im extra appreciative of since its been a while since ive jailbroken a device edit by smoothly i mean no random reboots or resprings and cydia has crashed maybe twice since i updated from packages load fine and compatible tweaks ive installed work fine so far
jailbreak,not_removed,im updating to the latest beta every time one is released so im on now and it works perfect
jailbreak,not_removed,im on on can i jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,im on running using beta with cydia beta and dam my phone is great battery has improved as well no random resprings or reboots no glitches no slowness nothing i have a few stuff installed but im staying away from the major stuff icleaner pro filza wifi booster tetherme
jailbreak,not_removed,can you list what you have installed im running cydia installs tweaks but seems like it reboots instead of respring also when i launch into safe mode it reboots as soon as i unlock my screen
jailbreak,not_removed,list of what you have installed
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont actually know somebody has probably asked that already
jailbreak,not_removed,can i just move down to beta after moving from beta to is when all the random reboots starting happening
jailbreak,not_removed,whats the easiest way to get a list of tweaks cos i have alot installed
jailbreak,not_removed,i cant be sure if it was me i would delete the jailbreak sideload the beta and see what happens then im not updating to beta since the beta is smooth for me also if you do downgrade dont forget to update cydia to beta
jailbreak,not_removed,ive just screenshot them and link to imgur
jailbreak,not_removed,did luca remove all the downloads for the betas off his site i cant find any besides beta
jailbreak,not_removed,here you go
jailbreak,not_removed,just remove cydia substrate not cydia installer this will remove all your tweaks then you can start over theres no need to break out the nukes when a simple hammer will do
jailbreak,not_removed,possibly about a day
jailbreak,not_removed,are you positive this works i want to try it
jailbreak,not_removed,if youve deleted odd files
jailbreak,not_removed,as long as you havent messed around with systems files removing cydia substrate is the best method to start over udegens
jailbreak,not_removed,yes its also much safer than eraser
jailbreak,not_removed,i guess a lot longer if erasor needs to repair more i actually only have used the old cydia impactor a year ago
jailbreak,not_removed,did u install xmodgames or iapcrazy
jailbreak,not_removed,dont know but that chick looks completely blasted
jailbreak,not_removed,nope its the apps itself and i always get these ads when i use the app
jailbreak,not_removed,if you have no file explorer installe like ifile or filza its possible through ssh but easier to make a fresh restore with itunes and jailbreak again sometimes restoring from old jailbroken devices can cause this
jailbreak,not_removed,yep i fixed it a while ago through updating to the same firmware a bit tedious but worth it
jailbreak,not_removed,i had icleaner and app tweak but i deleted them and my cydia says loading and it gets stuck on that i uninstalled icleaner because it wouldnt restart it just told me it was gonna respring and there was a loading wheel that lasted for eternity
jailbreak,not_removed,okay im in no substrate so do i install icleaner or something
jailbreak,not_removed,does it do it in safe mode also have you tried logging out of icloudapp store from the device turn off the device sign back in
jailbreak,not_removed,im new to jailbreak how do i access safe mode
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry safe mode is when something crashes in the device like maybe a tweak caused it and then the device takes you to safe mode but whats your ios version
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,oh yeah its in the title 😂😭😭😭 but um do you use the pangu app or the website i dont know if it does the same for the website or if if its the same for semi untethered jailbreaks but just sign out the app store turn phone on sign in and see if the error goes away if not then go to no substrate mode before pressing go or whatever it is to start it hold volume up the whole time the device will reboot and it will look like stock ios but cydia should be able to open

jailbreak,not_removed,that needs to be a sticky thread lol
jailbreak,not_removed,lol thats what i said in the comments of another post p
jailbreak,not_removed,wat
jailbreak,not_removed,here come dat boi
jailbreak,not_removed,i know thats why i did this
jailbreak,not_removed,what the hell is this dam son httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubot
jailbreak,not_removed,oh shit waddup
jailbreak,not_removed,well im honored xd
jailbreak,not_removed,does anyone have problems with the flash light toggle i press it and it takes a while for it to turn on
jailbreak,not_removed,horseshoe noctis flipcontrolcenter
jailbreak,not_removed,httpsstreamablecomfactn recorded by me
jailbreak,not_removed,this is horseshoeswiping up on the main section brings up the configuration options for the tweak which is what youre seeig
jailbreak,not_removed,how did you blur your cc like that
jailbreak,not_removed,what it is if you havent been answered already is you slide up in your control center there slide up again like you are trying to pull up another cc hope this helped
jailbreak,not_removed,theme is nice what is it
jailbreak,not_removed,temporary fix after toggling the flash light on which doesnt turn on obviously hold the bluetooth icon in cc
jailbreak,not_removed,also temp fix slide down cc that should actually turn it on
jailbreak,not_removed,same i think this is a known issue annoying as fuck
jailbreak,not_removed,same
jailbreak,not_removed,its horseshoe just slide up on the screen once you open the control center and itll be normal again
jailbreak,not_removed,its horseshoe just pull it up so that the cc is a little above the bottom now a configure button should appear just let de cc slide down and you are good to go again
jailbreak,not_removed,may i know the repository for horseshoe
jailbreak,not_removed,hi when i swipe up theres no option to configure any ideas
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks 🙏
jailbreak,not_removed,i thought it was just me lol
jailbreak,not_removed,i just respringed i also have another question when i enable the flashlight it turns on when i slide down on the cc is this a bug
jailbreak,not_removed,cost money but just look up horseshoe on this subreddit it will tell you
jailbreak,not_removed,make sure horsehoe is updated latest release
jailbreak,not_removed,happy to help
jailbreak,not_removed,never encountered that before i have the exact same tweak that you have
jailbreak,not_removed,same
jailbreak,not_removed,this happens to me too guessing its a bug with horseshoe uatwiiks
jailbreak,not_removed,no its a feature that allows you to reorder sections just swipe up and youll see configure show up keep swiping and itll go back to cc
jailbreak,not_removed,same
jailbreak,not_removed,same
jailbreak,not_removed,any way to downgrade to the old horseshoe like the one we all used before he upgraded to this one havent seemed to find a way bc the flashlight thing is pretty annoying thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,strange
jailbreak,not_removed,this happened to me no idea why
jailbreak,not_removed,have you got disabled installed the tweak that stops your phone being disabled after too many wrong password attempts
jailbreak,not_removed,i had this problem as well and made a post about it nobody had ever heard of it if you could make a tweak list and people that have this problem can check to see what tweaks we have in common we could probably narrow the problem down and contact the devs
jailbreak,not_removed,did you guys use someone elses account to download an app and forget to sign out when you were done
jailbreak,not_removed,i had this problem after installing a tweak similar to icaughtu dont remember the exact name of it
jailbreak,not_removed,its pegasus 😂 im joking though
jailbreak,not_removed,no dont get it its not compatible and causes issues very similar to one youre talking about haha
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont think lockplus is updated to work with
jailbreak,not_removed,i understand that youre excited but you should understand that this is a shitpost and no one cares
jailbreak,not_removed,lucky ive been stuck on no jailbreak for months
jailbreak,not_removed,umm be more butthurt edit can see your point didnt mean to brag hopefully gsteam pulls through
jailbreak,not_removed,trust me dudeit took me a long time to get this
jailbreak,not_removed,u wamt to tell me u can know the iphone date so iphone firmware
jailbreak,not_removed,use this site and enter the serial number httpwwwchipmunknlklantenserviceapplemodelhtml and if the production date is week or even in some cases belowstrong chance it will be ios to and jail breakable
jailbreak,not_removed,lol 😂
jailbreak,not_removed,congrats man lucky i would say but about the blur use the stock photo editor and use the black marker that will hide it better than a blur its actually still possible to see it if looking a bit
jailbreak,not_removed,fbm does this i believe
jailbreak,not_removed,lockscreen read
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks i guess
jailbreak,not_removed,theres a flex patch that does this lockscreen no slide to passcode screen
jailbreak,not_removed,would you remember the name by chance
jailbreak,not_removed,e never mind found it under ls no auto slide to passcode screen on failed touchid attempt
jailbreak,not_removed,i just updated the comment above youre too quick
jailbreak,not_removed,httpsimgurcomapnuyv search the cloud for ls no passcode view on failed touchid attempts
jailbreak,not_removed,you rock thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,ahhh you posted right before my edit thanks again
jailbreak,not_removed,usinfool rocks 🤘🏾 i was just the messenger enjoy
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for the mention
jailbreak,not_removed,set up if you can i dont know if banking apps have been reported as hacked i dont think so
jailbreak,not_removed,what if the pc app never asked me for an apple id and jailbroke worked fine but i have my card on my current apple id on my phone
jailbreak,not_removed,can you tell exactly how is set up id like to do this as well tia
jailbreak,not_removed,once you login to paypal click the setting cog and select security you will see the option for security key select it and it will take you thru the process if you dont receive a text its because you have some sort of blocking on your texting from your mobile service
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you ive taken care of it

jailbreak,not_removed,tactful partially works touch to peek and pop inside the app work however icon touch doesnt work unfortunately
jailbreak,not_removed,im using a flex patch to resolve that issue if you use flex theres a custom cursor patch under systemwide that allows you to change your cursor color to whatever you want itll apply everywhere though not just safari but personally i dont mind that
jailbreak,not_removed,i try flex but it only change in the apps that is not enable eclips uu

jailbreak,not_removed,hold volume after you press go delete latest tweaks and reboot
jailbreak,not_removed,it will enter in no substrate mode so you can fix
jailbreak,not_removed,to enter in no substrate mode press go on yalu and hold volume till you see lockscreen
jailbreak,not_removed,activator if its really a restriction inside the app you can just add to the volume again whenever you open that app
jailbreak,not_removed,try changing the track and then changing it back
jailbreak,not_removed,its been talked about several times now dont know if its gonna happen
jailbreak,not_removed,you cant u can only upgrade to on any phone
jailbreak,not_removed,so the watch follows the same signing window like regular ios updates
jailbreak,not_removed,no matter what the signing window is you couldnt push any specific update to the watch
jailbreak,not_removed,i know that but if im already on a different version it should update to the highest version of that phone thats what i thought
jailbreak,not_removed,interesting theory i dont think it works like that though i think it will still update to the latest version then then either stop working on the phone or stop working when you unpair it and try to pair it again this will and it sucks anyhow try to go to the watch app and try to update it it will download it but you dont have to install it them you you can use i cleaner to delete it
jailbreak,not_removed,the app is only supposed to show the version thats compatible with your phone problem is it doesnt show any updates available
jailbreak,not_removed,yea cause none are comp with your phone that are being signed
jailbreak,not_removed,try clicking one of the bottom bar sections times
jailbreak,not_removed,having this same problem
jailbreak,not_removed,reboot your phone and try installing or update any app you want and see if it works if it is then rejailbreak and try again in jailbreak mode
jailbreak,not_removed,anytime mate and glad it worked
jailbreak,not_removed,use vpn or delete app admin
jailbreak,not_removed,you learn something new every day
jailbreak,not_removed,heh i just did that about five minutes ago almost accidentally updated p but now its fixed thanks anyway your solution either way helped
jailbreak,not_removed,did it fix your problem
jailbreak,not_removed,sadly no
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry bro
jailbreak,not_removed,help pls
jailbreak,not_removed,its literally on the front page of rjailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,httpaptsaurikcomdebs
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,release jailbreak you probably just set off about a thousand devices
jailbreak,not_removed,god damn it if
jailbreak,not_removed,you should add the im on ios x can i downgrade to ios x so i can have a jb
jailbreak,not_removed,no point if the dude wants to ask his question hes gonna also icloud bypass shit man why not simply state they cant other than being against this subs rules it really rustles my jimmies when an antitheft method is tackled its unethical and if something doesnt work for them they are gonna ask here anyway the other thing i raised my eyebrow at is the i want to unjailbreak method ive restored numerous jailbroken backups to jailbroken devices the jailbreak is not going away the way to unjailbreak is to restore via itunes a backup cannot magically unstash a filesystem especially if its coming from an already jailbroken device now dont get me wrong i dont want you to remove this but it needs fixes
jailbreak,not_removed,cool another resource for countless people to ignore
jailbreak,not_removed,not trying to rain on your parade but we had a faq at jailbreakqa guess how many people didnt read it p
jailbreak,not_removed,not like ppl will actually use it most answers can be found by a quick search on google and ppl still come asking the same questions weekly
jailbreak,not_removed,it is useful and can be place on the sidebar keep it up dude
jailbreak,not_removed,is this website made with bootstrap
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt start well when the first link of the page is a dead one
jailbreak,not_removed,pretty cool and basic should be stickied
jailbreak,not_removed,looks sweet definitely willing to spend for this
jailbreak,not_removed,you should add how do i sell my phonetablet with a jailbreak todo remove the tweak from angelxwind if installed then reset all settings saves times instead of doing it with ituntes the website looks cool you could add a favicon and make it more organized
jailbreak,not_removed,shit didnt even think about that sorry
jailbreak,not_removed,great idea will do
jailbreak,not_removed,the icloud bypass one was defiantly nothing to try and help people it was more to stop people downloading random viruss im either going to remove the what works section and make it all about what doesnt or remove it completely im not supporting it in anyway at all and your right about the unjailbreak section too this really is just a rough version of the site i plan on refining everything tonight and adding new info this isnt a one of page i want to continually update it so that it has the newestbest inofrmation possible thanks for the feedback i appreciate it
jailbreak,not_removed,its actually about what does and doesnt work its not a tutorial or anything the point of it is to stop people downloading junk trying to bypass icloud locks
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe the mods can make a sticky link that says new users here
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah
jailbreak,not_removed,its not
jailbreak,not_removed,isnt that the one that introduced the more secure kpp s
jailbreak,not_removed,its free and always will be no point trying to charge for something like this anyway and it would kinda defeat the point but i appreciate the comment
jailbreak,not_removed,oh gawd
jailbreak,not_removed,rjailbreak likes to downvote people who postes multiple comments saying the same thing delete the other two comments
jailbreak,not_removed,im happy you dont see this feedback as bashing on you since that wasnt my intention no matter what your intention is with any sorts of guides to remove icloud if youre so keen on people not downloading wacky malware then put out a text saying no its not possible please dont download any icloud unlocker software for your own safety and there you have it and the people who do steal phones and unlock their icloud might as well just download some cancerware because they deserve it as for the unjailbreak section you should replace the current text with a short introduction of cydia impactor describing briefly how it works and what are the risks especially on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,would you be willing to sticky this once its refined
jailbreak,not_removed,pretty cool im making a website too right now and its incredible how fast its done but very clean and good looking
jailbreak,not_removed,httpscanijailbreakcom says is unavailable
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah thats right
jailbreak,not_removed,reddit app bugged out not my intention fixed
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i dont have any sympathy for people who steal phones but i know people who have bought phones on ebay only to have them show up icloud locked i have myself i just didnt want those people to download malware ill replace it with a bunch of info about contacting ebay and getting your money back and make it much better also for the unjailbreak section ill do a much more detailed rewrite when im home fixing the other stuff
jailbreak,not_removed,i think you should ask him that once its refined
jailbreak,not_removed,its not illegal to talk about what works and what doesnt edit just realised its against the sub rules if the mods want ill remove that section of the site
jailbreak,not_removed,it doesnt teach but im happy to delete it
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah its really easy to get something good looking fast be sure to send me a link
jailbreak,not_removed,working fine on my end
jailbreak,not_removed,i know it wasnt your intention i hope they fix that bug soon
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i bought one on ebay found out it was icloud locke and sold it to some girl she didnt know what icloud was so she sent it back and i gave her a refund and used it for parts
jailbreak,not_removed,thats much better that way you cant display the information just for legitimate buyers who got tricked to be honest every country on this planet should have local buying or selling sites you can always find used phones around you which means you can actually meet the seller and check out the phone for yourself as for new ones they are never that much cheaper in price to make it worth the wait and the risk especially because tax and other extra fees add up so buying a phone from ebay is pretty dumb i think i dont say people who buy there deserve the icloud lock but there should be a warning against buying phones online edit another thing to note if this redirects to your blog anyway then just make this little menu thingy a sidebar in your blog no need for this to be a separate site
jailbreak,not_removed,ah ok i understood your comment my bad lol
jailbreak,not_removed,that is weird i get this web page is not available errsslversionorciphermismatch hide details a secure connection cannot be established because this site uses an unsupported protocol

jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work for yalu

jailbreak,not_removed,oh do you know why 😓
jailbreak,not_removed,immortal tweak tweaks dont work when youre not jailbroken itll keep it sign but only when youre jailbroken but then you wouldnt need yalu so yea
jailbreak,not_removed,well thats kinda obvious feel like an idiot now 😖 thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,the problem with pirate repos apart from the moral issues is that they dont know how to configure their repos properly remove the pirate repos and try again

jailbreak,not_removed,safe mode is broken so if you install an uncompatible tweak it will put you into safe mode then it will crash then your phone will get into no substrate mode you can delete the tweak there respring and things should be just fine
jailbreak,not_removed,this happened to me yesterday but after the automatic respring after safe mode i just went into cydia and uninstalled tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,substrate safe mode
jailbreak,not_removed,yesterday i restore my device cause this problem so if i install an uncompatible tweak can i use this step
jailbreak,not_removed,compatible w ios partial
jailbreak,not_removed,this is not really a step safe mode is supposed to crash and then your phone should boot into no substrate mode at least thats what my phone did last time i installed an incompatible tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,ahh okay yesterday it was my fault cause idk if safe mode is crash
jailbreak,not_removed,also if you had any activator actions set it is risky with guestmode tip use activator and password events to be safe wrong password a change activator profile b disable quickdo so all activator triggers get disabled while in guest mode right password back to default profile enable quickdo
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackageorgthebigbossguestmode bigboss tweaks customizable guest experience that keeps you in charge praise grate god™ type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,does guest mode support ios
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,how did you guys get night shift mode
jailbreak,not_removed,creatix isnt answering our one question about it being what does it meean p
jailbreak,not_removed,uioscreatix what version of ios is your phone in the video
jailbreak,not_removed,does using a winterboard theme along with this tweak affect the tweak at all
jailbreak,not_removed,funny how you guys both have night shift and the newappinstalledbadge for cydia all of the elements that point to a jailbreak 😛
jailbreak,not_removed,love big and rich
jailbreak,not_removed,i know a lot of people dont use apple music i hope it has support for deezer and spotify thanks for the great work
jailbreak,not_removed,or are they trolling us with a tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,looks kinda like little apple watch apps on your homescreen looking forward to it
jailbreak,not_removed,looks good i hate teases though
jailbreak,not_removed,such a great song
jailbreak,not_removed,is it compatible with the tweak cylinder
jailbreak,not_removed,cant wait to try it i have to get my cydia to workopen again though and no idea how to do that
jailbreak,not_removed,compatibility i never updated to the versions to keep my jb and because i fear my might get really slow with newer versions
jailbreak,not_removed,this is now one of the main reasons i need this jailbreak great work
jailbreak,not_removed,how much wip is this still edit thanks for the downvotes i guess just asking a sincere question
jailbreak,not_removed,how does the camera block work
jailbreak,not_removed,i remember your first post a few years ago really nice to see this again its always been my favorite tweak idea
jailbreak,not_removed,nice work fantastic design as well hope the battery doesnt drain too much looks like its worth the download
jailbreak,not_removed,awesome will you make it compatible with anchor
jailbreak,not_removed,i cant wait to try this too bad ill have to wait until next jailbreak is here
jailbreak,not_removed,neat
jailbreak,not_removed,awesome
jailbreak,not_removed,kinda looks like you are using touch i hope its just a long touch to use it but then what about movingdeleting apps dont get me wrong though it looks great cant wait to try it if there is a jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,ill be buying this one
jailbreak,not_removed,uioscreatix do you know how this tweak will impact our iphones batteries since its like a widget will it use up quite a lot thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,just awesome mate now i really want a jb haha damn this looks so good it better be ripped off for ios if there wont came any jb
jailbreak,not_removed,ew country😒 jk
jailbreak,not_removed,so this is a ripoff of cpdigitaldarkrooms idea i still like it tho
jailbreak,not_removed,nightshift toggle for flux this toggle is a flux flipswitch that works like the nightshift toggle on ios source i have it installed
jailbreak,not_removed,yes it will
jailbreak,not_removed,and in this case they are teasing a tweak and an ios jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,you shouldve grabbed my iphone works beautifully jailbroken on it
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,these are not the same devs
jailbreak,not_removed,shouldnt drain the battery
jailbreak,not_removed,pinching to open and close editing is not effected
jailbreak,not_removed,um this project started years ago
jailbreak,not_removed,not a ripoff i believe he worked on this project too
jailbreak,not_removed,and how did he get the pop up from nightshift flux doesnt do that
jailbreak,not_removed,or is it
jailbreak,not_removed,yea but the toggles are smaller you cant currently do that
jailbreak,not_removed,not sayings its a jailbreak but afaik that flipswitch toggle doesnt show the popup nor the white update text like when you turn onoff night shift on
jailbreak,not_removed,what repo is the toggle on
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah how do you have that pop up
jailbreak,not_removed,or is it
jailbreak,not_removed,whats the official repo for flux
jailbreak,not_removed,how did he make bottom row toggles smaller
jailbreak,not_removed,its not hes jailbroke on i guarantee it they wouldnt fuck around and install a flex patch to make it look jailbroken its not worth the hassle of all the questions hes not an attention seeker just a dev with a new tweak for when the new tool drops
jailbreak,not_removed,amazon prizme please
jailbreak,not_removed,but what about the popup i think the tweak cant do that
jailbreak,not_removed,awesome
jailbreak,not_removed,is this video demonstrated on ios trying to understand the night shift toggle and night shift pop up
jailbreak,not_removed,that is truly neat im excited
jailbreak,not_removed,super sexy it made my girlfriend slightly wet
jailbreak,not_removed,oh well then
jailbreak,not_removed,oh thats good keep up the great work
jailbreak,not_removed,hold this l for me
jailbreak,not_removed,oh ok i thought the incendows matchstick cpdigitaldarkrooms iosblocks was about years old archiveorg just told me it wasntt humm sry
jailbreak,not_removed,wat
jailbreak,not_removed,add repolaughingquollnet directly to cydia then install flipswitch nightshift toggle for flux and flipcontrolcenter polus also works then simply add the nightshift toggle to enabled in active switches for the bottom shelf and set switches per page to in either flipcontrolcenter or polus settings
jailbreak,not_removed,httpjustgetfluxcomcydia googling is hard
jailbreak,not_removed,lol just joking that maybe he has a jb
jailbreak,not_removed,use your shsh blobs to downgrade your plane ticket
jailbreak,not_removed,i dunno ive gone the past two and spoke at both i feel its kinda pointless to spend a ticket on it id rather spend the money on a hotel room and just meet up with the people i usually hang out with most of the talks are from people that will talk with you on other mediums slack irc email etc so youre not really missing out on content that you could personally talk to them about its a community meetup its not on the level of wwdc because thats an impeccable standard to meet which i feel like it tries to be but fails if it goes through this year ill probably buy a ticket out of respect to saurik and flawless and their work done to put it together but ill probably do what i did the last two years give a short talk and ditch to get some badass food and explore san francisco just my opinion and thoughts others share experiences
jailbreak,not_removed,jailbreak is literally dead xd
jailbreak,not_removed,😭😭😭😭😭
jailbreak,not_removed,udjmannyd seems to have posted about it last maybe he can help

jailbreak,not_removed,xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd
jailbreak,not_removed,tru dat
jailbreak,not_removed,wot
jailbreak,not_removed,what
jailbreak,not_removed,i didnt make that comparison at all flawless youre insinuating that i am though which makes me feel like youve got a bit triggered by the consideration that the egos of those who run the event are those equal to that of apples even though theyre really quite a small community and youre right about it not making any money because in past saurik has been kind enough to buy extra tickets to help pay for expenses knowing that i cant make the comparison on budget but rather stance and attempted appearance of the event see what ive done there cheeky

jailbreak,not_removed,what
jailbreak,not_removed,what
jailbreak,not_removed,stop
jailbreak,not_removed,i actually have had this same issue recently unfortunately i havent found a solution to it could you post a list of tweak you are using update it was album art center causing the issue
jailbreak,not_removed,sound like you downloaded an incompatible tweak go into cydia and look at your recent tweaks delete those that have anything to do with sound or audio
jailbreak,not_removed,nice glad you got out of that pickle
jailbreak,not_removed,mine was spin but i got it to work i think it was that and another that caused the crash
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i found out what was wrong it was a tweak called spin so i deleted curia substrate and started over good thing my phone still had all the config files
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah
jailbreak,not_removed,irrelevant comment i personally like the ui of tutus version more so than pokemongo only things i like about s would be the built in iv checker and pokemon pop up map scan i wonder if its possible to get a standalone tweak of tutus dpad and geo coordinate spoofing hack also you didnt ask your question
jailbreak,not_removed,sidenote although compared to other hacks this is more fair kinda even though it totally really isnt please dont use hacks all it does is ruin the point of the game and make us who want to play legitimately have an unfair time
jailbreak,not_removed,days later and i just realized i never asked the question lol
jailbreak,not_removed,open cydia let cydia load fully remove icleaner respring open cydia and let it load fully again and then install icleaner again
jailbreak,not_removed,reboot rejailbreak viola and next time use search bar
jailbreak,not_removed,didnt work
jailbreak,not_removed,which icleaner do you have what repo and what version
jailbreak,not_removed,i tried one from ivano bilenchi on version and the pro version but theyre both crashing
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,braille skateboarding 🙌
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,statusvol
jailbreak,not_removed,volumebar can be set to do that
jailbreak,not_removed,sonus works but its missing the speaker icons free tweak that does almost what i want but well enough thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,instavolume by httpwwwwizagescomcydia
jailbreak,not_removed,all the existing status volume tweaks look crap and doesnt have the smooth transition effect upon volume change
jailbreak,not_removed,statusbarvolume
jailbreak,not_removed,httpshimynameisubikgithubio
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i heard sonus is pretty dope
jailbreak,not_removed,sonus could not find info about this tweaktheme designed with crayons built with legos type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,im getting good at identifying what rjailbreak watches now lol
jailbreak,not_removed,👌👌👌👌👌👍
jailbreak,not_removed,both statusvol and statusvol x contain some bugs that were never fixed i tried them both for quite some time you better go with sonus or amalthea
jailbreak,not_removed,i found that weird also sometimes it does display the speaker icons and other times it doesnt
jailbreak,not_removed,turn on indicators in settings media volume will then show speakers
jailbreak,not_removed,have you tried sonus
jailbreak,not_removed,oops thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,the latest update is slightly buggy as far as animations but i absolutely love your work
jailbreak,not_removed,i like sonus but it crashes me into safe mode when i change volume up and down quickly
jailbreak,not_removed,really never experienced any bugs but im on
jailbreak,not_removed,its that way on purpose they will only show when you change your media volume
jailbreak,not_removed,indicators are only displayed on media volume
jailbreak,not_removed,trying it right now doesnt have the volume indicator and transition upon volume change isnt smooth
jailbreak,not_removed,whats buggy with the animationsd thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,never heard of that sorry might want to check if you have any statusbar tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,sweet somebody understands it
jailbreak,not_removed,turn on indicators and then media volume will show the speakers what do you mean by the animation is not smooth
jailbreak,not_removed,when blur is enabled in the latest version it flickers an odd color without showing the volume bar heres a video so you can better understand
jailbreak,not_removed,the only status bar tweaks i have are date in status bar and hidemex to hide the carrier
jailbreak,not_removed,indicators is turned on i even resprung my device but the volume icons are not showing up by smooth animation when you turn the volume up or down the bar smoothly adjust youtube it glides
jailbreak,not_removed,youre totally correct i must have missed testing that since i personally dont use blur will fix asap
jailbreak,not_removed,updated
jailbreak,not_removed,hmm thats really strange every version or just the latest i can go crazy on changing volume up and down nothing happens
jailbreak,not_removed,if you have media playing video music whatever it sill show the speakers ah i see dont know if i can do that
jailbreak,not_removed,noted
jailbreak,not_removed,works perfectly again thank you so much you are the best
jailbreak,not_removed,it tried it a few days ago i just tried the new version and i havent had any crashes so far if i do ill send you the crash log
jailbreak,not_removed,cheers man
jailbreak,not_removed,not legitimate as far as i know
jailbreak,not_removed,download it and check it out only way to truely know
jailbreak,not_removed,from the looks of it you have pirate repos so im guessing a pirate repo have just repacked it with the number uninstall your pirate repos and see if it still comes up
jailbreak,not_removed,due to not being jailbreak related this would be best posted in rios only thing i can suggest is to restore to again and set up as new
jailbreak,not_removed,no one has provided any direct evidence of a hack associated with the jailbreak just speculation and fearmongering
jailbreak,not_removed,dope man btw for the future httprjailbreakcomflair
jailbreak,not_removed,i agree i understand the ops excitement but it would be nice if people didnt post just to post as far as i can see theres no real discussion to be had and there are already plenty of posts discussing the ios versions being sold or replaced instore
jailbreak,not_removed,so basically you lied cheated and made shit up just so you could jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,why do people seriously think they gotta share this
jailbreak,not_removed,just did thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,exactly
jailbreak,not_removed,then go in its still not important for a post its stupid
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you very much you just made my night this was needed to repair a bonehead move where i stashed with yucca forgot about it and wiped through settings
jailbreak,not_removed,not an issue glad i could help if you need anything else feel free to let me know
jailbreak,not_removed,will do you should have reddit gold now btw idk if it told you
jailbreak,not_removed,oh i just seen that thanks a lot first time getting it haha happy new years
jailbreak,not_removed,if its from the appstore theres a high chance it could be not legitimate
jailbreak,not_removed,ya idk then im not an expert on this stuff
jailbreak,not_removed,mine was at at cycles with battery life you probably just have a good battery
jailbreak,not_removed,mine is capacity cycles
jailbreak,not_removed,what app is this
jailbreak,not_removed,after cycles
jailbreak,not_removed,i got cycles and
jailbreak,not_removed,some people just got lucky with the battery from what i know you must prevent your phone to heat too much like above degrees
jailbreak,not_removed,lithiumion man theyre incredible batteries when they work properly ive had my since release and im at cant check cycles as dont have battery life side loaded atm
jailbreak,not_removed,its the app thats from the same developer as the jb version but im not sure if its as accurate
jailbreak,not_removed,is that a thing are some stock batteries just better out of the box
jailbreak,not_removed,mines at with cycles apple told me its within spec 👎
jailbreak,not_removed,battery life httpsappstorecazebbabi
jailbreak,not_removed,good luck with that nearly every day here in australia is that temp or above in the shade during summer god forbid you jump in your car after leaving it parked in the sun
jailbreak,not_removed,it gives the same answers at the jb version but it takes the app store version about seconds to a minute to get an updated capacity measurement that matches the measurement that you get from the jb version mine is at after cycles if your battery had a slightly higher capacity to begin with it could still be working its way down to the advertised mark the circuit that calculates capacity will not report a capacity larger than even if it is above that so you probably just got lucky on the battery enjoy also if you do a recalibrate where you let it drain all the way til it shuts off then wait an hour then plug it in and let it charge for at least hour after it finishes charging you may get a different answer youre supposed to let it run all the way down about once per month anyway
jailbreak,not_removed,what is your iphone model
jailbreak,not_removed,under is a replacement
jailbreak,not_removed,the last part is very not true that is only for really old batteries do not let it run dry
jailbreak,not_removed,its a
jailbreak,not_removed,that was their guidance as recently as a year ago it looks like that is no longer the case as it is no longer published
jailbreak,not_removed,seems the is not so lucky given examples i have seen anyway you only know for sure the real capacity when its fully charged try again that way
jailbreak,not_removed,okay

jailbreak,not_removed,mind telling where to find yaluinstalledx the directory
jailbreak,not_removed,plus
jailbreak,not_removed,so then ur not jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,main directory
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah yalu does not work with the as stated on the website for all ios bit devices except you can only use beta machportal scroll down on the website
jailbreak,not_removed,anemone usually uses the springboard preview of what your icons look like in no substrate mode so if you dont have any icons on your dock or your first page thats why the preview is blank instead of full of icons
jailbreak,not_removed,did you try installing some apps
jailbreak,not_removed,do you have something related to an opw installed

jailbreak,not_removed,how much more literal can this get
jailbreak,not_removed,common bug
jailbreak,not_removed,how do you get your cc to look like that
jailbreak,not_removed,temporary fix after toggling the flash light on which doesnt turn on obviously hold the bluetooth icon in cc
jailbreak,not_removed,yes rip flash light youll be missed
jailbreak,not_removed,lucky you can update dont remmeber my password on the authenticatethingy havent got any answer from atwiiks in days
jailbreak,not_removed,same problem here hope get an update to fix this
jailbreak,not_removed,what do u mean no flashlight its bottom left
jailbreak,not_removed,latest horseshoe update and flipcontrolcenter with the stately theme enabled in anemone
jailbreak,not_removed,or you can just pull the cc down after toggling it on and itll activate the flashlight
jailbreak,not_removed,i have the same problem and that actually works
jailbreak,not_removed,when enabled it does not turn on lol
jailbreak,not_removed,lmao that work xd
jailbreak,not_removed,oh lol have u tried icleaner
jailbreak,not_removed,i used duet display for about minutes no way are you going to be able to game
jailbreak,not_removed,oh well maybe one day there will be some sort of option do you think its because i dont have usb or is it just not possibility in general i cant wait till monitors are wireless the protocols are already invented but the spectrum and the methods are just not available to consumers yet
jailbreak,not_removed,do you think you could inform me if you use usb versus
jailbreak,not_removed,its just not a possibility in general the app isnt meant for playing video games just using as a second screen for work related stuff and i dont have any usb ports on my computer
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i get that but it has less lag then the moonlight app and tweak and moonlight is for games regardless it would seem that the technology is just not there yet for minimal lag
jailbreak,not_removed,install liblocation in cydia problem solved
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you very much ill give it a try once i install the english pangu app
jailbreak,not_removed,not possible thats some sorcery shit
jailbreak,not_removed,hes right even if you have a jailbreak for your ipod there are no public keys and iv necessary for kloader since dual booting or downgrade on devices require kloader youre pretty much sol either way

jailbreak,not_removed,try protect my privacy from the bigboss repo it works great for me on
jailbreak,not_removed,not sure what ios youre on but this feature is available in the debug mode of maps completely free so basically its used for ios devs and so its implemented by apple and works in the native maps app
jailbreak,not_removed,search cydia for anywhere
jailbreak,not_removed,i use fakemylocation but it costs money i believe what ios version are you running and device
jailbreak,not_removed,locationfaker
jailbreak,not_removed,pmp has also been updated for ios the update took forever but it happened and it works though i havent tried out its location faking edit yup pmps location faker works on ios google maps now thinks im safely in the middle of the atlantic ocean
jailbreak,not_removed,i have the same issue i dont know what causing it
jailbreak,not_removed,you need to enter nosubstrate mode to do this on ios you need to open the yalu app and then hold down the volume up button while simultaneously pressing the go button you need to hold the volume up button until you see the spinning wheel once you get to the lockscreen and unlock your device you can open cydia to uninstall whichever new tweaks you think caused the issue or you can open icleaner pro and disable tweaks to find which ones are causing problems after disabling or deleting tweaks you need to reboot and then rejailbreak the normal way
jailbreak,not_removed,they are competitors with snap vs phantom
jailbreak,not_removed,that was one boring phone call
jailbreak,not_removed,fuck all that noise theres nothing wrong with unlimapps
jailbreak,not_removed,im so sick of this guy claiming unlimapps are malicious and deceiving yet hes given literally proof or evidence to back himself up he just seems salty that unlimapps release better tweaks than him ¯ツ¯
jailbreak,not_removed,cokepoke is a kid scared of competition that has superior products also some racist tweets on his feed so ill gladly see him go down
jailbreak,not_removed,i do find it funny when i used one their facebook app to remove ads only to have them replaced with their own
jailbreak,not_removed,any proofs of that
jailbreak,not_removed,the dev of cercube told me that they used most of cercube code to make youtube so i guess cokepokes is onto something
jailbreak,not_removed,unlimapps outsources of the tweaks on his repo you can look at some of his tweaks and they say like thanks to couldnt have done it without them they did a lot of the work his code has also has shown that snap was not using ads to take users away and attract them and revealed he was going to implement ads once he took cokes users away and his tremendous lack of unoriginality and ideas is what grinds his gears using or and not even changing the original name and not being entirely groundbreaking when it comes to tweaks like snapchat facebook instagram etc tweaks have been made for all of them and hes just swooping by and creating alternatives and rather inferior products just to make a quick buck wouldnt be surprised if he left the original developer tag in his code ¯ツ¯ just my input on why coke would be upset
jailbreak,not_removed,i use unlimappss tweaks for years and everything is perfect seems like hes just talking shit so ppl would get his tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,if you want to see something interesting regarding the rivalry do a search in this sub for snap crash and note the number of results then do a search for phantom crash and yet he still doesnt seem to understand why people switch
jailbreak,not_removed,ive been usin unlimapps tweaks since like ios so i dont think theres anything wrong in there
jailbreak,not_removed,does anyone know if there will be phantom for people with nonjailbreak phones upcoming
jailbreak,not_removed,just because of this im switching to snap who is he to say theyre malicious based on no evidence
jailbreak,not_removed,phantom is so much better than snap its ridiculous i heard about this update before i updated it myself so im still safe
jailbreak,not_removed,since where kind of related to phantom i always try installing it and succeeds but when opening snapchat with phantom installed it crashes instantly ive got snap removed
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah but why does he have to say malicious just because theyre competitors afaik they didnt do anything wrong they just made a similar tweak when he used malicious that must mean theyre trying to do something that will hurt users
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont like phantom tho
jailbreak,not_removed,anyone thats been in the jb community for atleast years knows how childish cokepokes is hes a great developer but very childish when it comes to competition hes made fun of unlimapps multiple times in the past because apparently he stole my tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,hes a known manchild but that doesnt mean hes not a great coder which also makes better tweaks than unlimapps unlimapps have more choice for me but phantom is way ahead of snap
jailbreak,not_removed,your opinion
jailbreak,not_removed,proof of racist tweets
jailbreak,not_removed,he blocked me when i pointed out that black lives matter isnt a bullshit cause and black people arent all thugs
jailbreak,not_removed,i have never seen anything bout this on reddit if that was true it would be blasted on the front page for a long time so i honestly cant believe him at all
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,to have this guy ¯ツ¯ look correctly on reddit you have to wrote him like this ¯ツ¯
jailbreak,not_removed,he is it seems and by searching this sub on this cokepoke guy he seems sorta like a dick
jailbreak,not_removed,am i lucky that i like never get any crashes because i have only experienced one
jailbreak,not_removed,no it doesnt but im sure you read the post about that like everyone else according to the developer it only needed that info because he had an ad network which forces it to say it uses that info if you have the non ad version this service isnt even loaded and your information is not being taken
jailbreak,not_removed,the screenshot youre replying to might help
jailbreak,not_removed,all i can say is try to remove everything and reinstallsnapchat and the tweak usually with the latest version of snapchat it will work fine unless snapchat has been updated and the tweak developer has not made necessary changes
jailbreak,not_removed,hes banned i thought he just deleted his account
jailbreak,not_removed,i remember when i had to side load snap the ui was the same basically and the settings was so unorganized
jailbreak,not_removed,im going to guess its cokepokes way of scaring people from using their tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,he is unnecessarily mean to people on twitter if they even bring up unlimapps or any tweak made by them
jailbreak,not_removed,he means it takes your email and sends it to ad people also unlimiapp me already stated on there twitter that they are doing this and its in the terms of service
jailbreak,not_removed,malicious isnt strictly regarding software perhaps theyve had some harsh encounters and he feels they are being malicious and vindictive towards him
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,i didnt want to get involved and i dont really care but wasnt it just last month someone found out unlimapps uses our information without a way to remove it for ads
jailbreak,not_removed,malicious doesnt necessarily mean bad software or deceptive practices i think he just wanted to state that he doesnt like them
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah back when ios jailbreak came out the dev made snap which got cokepokes mad because at the time he was the only one who had a tweak for snapchat i also think he doesnt like competition i think dont quote me on that
jailbreak,not_removed,still doesnt justify him calling it malicious thats just plain false
jailbreak,not_removed,i think hes also annoyed that the dev uses the app name in the tweak name you mean like
jailbreak,not_removed,hes childish because hes in his teens or early twenties i think as are most developers in the scene i know thats no excuse for his actions but you can kinda understand why hes acting like a child then
jailbreak,not_removed,who do you think has a better snapchat platform i think that phantom looks more uniform than the large icons and ununiform settings i think that phantom looks more appealing to my eyes what do you think
jailbreak,not_removed,um youre not supposed to put to make people say something else eg would you change this design is not just what it looks like and feels like design is how it works to this design is not just how it works i dont think so
jailbreak,not_removed,all lives matter and people need to stop being twats and killing each other
jailbreak,not_removed,this isnt deceptive i had that issue with other repos too
jailbreak,not_removed,how do you avoid your information from being taken
jailbreak,not_removed,he did delete his account
jailbreak,not_removed,i can deal with unorganized settings for stability and frequent updates
jailbreak,not_removed,hes just unnecessarily mean to anyone on twitter no matter what huge manchild
jailbreak,not_removed,this is the correct answer hard to see it though with all the i think this and probably that unlimapps adds extra code in their tweaks to track the fuck out of you specifically it sends some of your information to ad servers the dev claims to not really know what all information thats collected he just says that the ad servers take care of that its adware and in my book its malicious edit fuck all of you and shame on you for supporting adware tweaks bane of jailbreaking
jailbreak,not_removed,that was a year ago catch up
jailbreak,not_removed,all apps with banner ads do
jailbreak,not_removed,malicious means intentionally hurtful
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah back when ios jailbreak came out the dev made snap which got cokepokes mad because at the time he was the only one who had a tweak for snapchat i also think he doesnt like competition imo dont quote me on that uxphantomlordx
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackagecomcokepokesphantom bigboss tweaks break nearly all of snapchats limits bleep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,i think hes or but he acts like hes
jailbreak,not_removed,currently i have phantom downloaded and installed i like phantom because its simplistic and very nice
jailbreak,not_removed,phantomsnap really any tweak with a is just lazy
jailbreak,not_removed,pretty sure he did that on purpose
jailbreak,not_removed,all lives do matter but you cant deny that there are some cops that are prejudiced not their fault completely because black people do make up a majority of the population in poverty which means they are more likely to commit violent crimes because of this prejudice the blm cause is valid we do need to stop killing each other this does not mean that all black people are thugs
jailbreak,not_removed,oh so when people say why does he say malicious and i provide an example for what cokepokes is talking about and i get downvoted for providing it lmao this sub is full of fucks
jailbreak,not_removed,so when did he get banned
jailbreak,not_removed,true politifact hehe
jailbreak,not_removed,greg put the tinfoil hat back on your balls r going green again
jailbreak,not_removed,my lord youre so fucking stupid
jailbreak,not_removed,no it doesnt stop spreading lies
jailbreak,not_removed,and not even a justified accusation as the fault wasnt at unlim
jailbreak,not_removed,oh so when people say why does he say malicious and i provide an example for what cokepokes is talking about and i get downvoted for providing it lmao this sub is full of fucks
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe because unlim knew that he had a snapchat project running and still decided to make their own and therewith intentionally hurt him but what do i know about life anyways
jailbreak,not_removed,haha i forgot about this bot
jailbreak,not_removed,i like it too it doesnt look ui cluttered like snap but i hate the ads and i am and dont have a paypal i hate the ads 😞
jailbreak,not_removed,not really
jailbreak,not_removed,never said black people are thugs just simply everyones lives matter and that everyone needs to stop making dumb decisions
jailbreak,not_removed,i never heard of him getting banned only when he deleted his account
jailbreak,not_removed,and do those fucking apps have root privilege
jailbreak,not_removed,exactly i guess this sub is full of fucks is the right phrase after all
jailbreak,not_removed,dont you think there is a reason the mods have changed the flair of this post to misleading title i dont think you bothered to read the comments and that you just took the first relevant post saying unlimapps
jailbreak,not_removed,in no world is making a competing tweak malicious lmao
jailbreak,not_removed,haha i forgot about this bot dont quote me on that
jailbreak,not_removed,see theres where the lying comes in
jailbreak,not_removed,ah got ya i thought so i think he deleted his account after a user said he was showing others emails or something and he got very pissed off or whatever i was reading it in one of the posts
jailbreak,not_removed,hes right unlimapps code doesnt do anything normal apps dont when it comes to its ad service it has nothing to do with root privilege his code has been checked and hes even said if requested he will remove any of that data in no way does he actual steal your information
jailbreak,not_removed,look the thing is i linked to it because i remember this drama happening here coke pokes is clearly their competition so hell even if its not malicious what they were doing hes gonna hold it over them as propaganda of sorts in not siding with anyone here he just asked for a source and i provided it
jailbreak,not_removed,malicious means intentionally hurtful
jailbreak,not_removed,haha i forgot about this bot dont quote me on that ujaspergreenham
jailbreak,not_removed,hey now haha
jailbreak,not_removed,what do you mean
jailbreak,not_removed,i also dont side with anyone i just replied because i dont think pokecokes isare dumb enough to confuse a cydia bug for something malicious so it has to be something else thats probably the reason for the downvotes
jailbreak,not_removed,this is dumb
jailbreak,not_removed,people usually lie about their age to get onto things theyre not supposed to
jailbreak,not_removed,there were other things like their data collection policies
jailbreak,not_removed,that is malicious
jailbreak,not_removed,the thing is i am being absolutely honest i am cant have a card is there still a way i could purchase it
jailbreak,not_removed,but absolutely not in that post did you paste the wrong link i think there is a misunderstanding
jailbreak,not_removed,make the account and have someone send you money from their paypal you dont need a card just balance
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i think the wrong link for copied i did copy the wrong link at first and corrected it maybe there was an edit error not sure
jailbreak,not_removed,procam lets you use it manually thats an actual app not a tweak tho
jailbreak,not_removed,i use procam sometimes but i like live photos as well thats where this tweak would come handy
jailbreak,not_removed,should be nothing as long as it doesnt happen after every reboot
jailbreak,not_removed,i got that pop up also after updating new version of anemone i just reinstalled it and it works well now
jailbreak,not_removed,i am getting this problem after every reboot
jailbreak,not_removed,reboot and open a lot of apps about or more should work pretty much every time
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you so much bro cant believe that worked
jailbreak,not_removed,np man and ya thats what i thought at first as well i was always getting annoyed cause of random reboots then i had to retry the jb like times lol
jailbreak,not_removed,its working perfectly
jailbreak,not_removed,i just updated and theres a little yellow triangle with a in it is that a problem i have vexxilliumi think thats how its spelled and the deadpool boot logo along with
jailbreak,not_removed,those are legacy themes thats all that triangle means its a warning as its a legacy theme and if i remember ucoolstarorg had said that in the future anemone might not support legacy themes anymore and that its a warning to get them compatible or something like that it doesnt affect current functionality but in the future it might
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you dude
jailbreak,not_removed,stashing from coolstars repo
jailbreak,not_removed,ive read couple of weeks ago that with the cydia update stashing is no longer relevant do i really need to install it again
jailbreak,not_removed,substrate only stashed afew things coolstars tweak stashes way things install it and u will see u have to delete afew tweaks to make room for stashing tho but u will be able to install them back right after installing stashing
jailbreak,not_removed,i installed stashing but i only gained space do i need to uninstall then reinstall my tweaks again
jailbreak,not_removed,also try doing an icleaner cleaning you could also have a lot of cached files
jailbreak,not_removed,hooks into springboard to disable app signing and let you install whatever you want
jailbreak,not_removed,did you reboot while it was disabled in icleaner then tried the pangu app to go into jb mode
jailbreak,not_removed,i was asking myself the same question today still disanke and no side effects
jailbreak,not_removed,pangus jailbreak also installs it
jailbreak,not_removed,search
jailbreak,not_removed,i installed the jailbreak but it says something about apple driver has not been found
jailbreak,not_removed,how would i uninstall and downgrade
jailbreak,not_removed,damn i hate redmond pie p always redirecting me within themselves gotta bear through it though haha
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks d i did it and my jailbreak is up and running now
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for letting us know you deserve a medal
jailbreak,not_removed,new version of app admin is crashing the app store any ideas
jailbreak,not_removed,let us know when appsync gets updated d
jailbreak,not_removed,is it not normal if i say that appadmin work with me in and from the first bete of yalu jailbrreak
jailbreak,not_removed,dude use the right tag
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks paji
jailbreak,not_removed,when i try to down grade snapchat it just exits and goes back to home screen help
jailbreak,not_removed,repo
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work downloads only the most recent version of an app on
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks do we need appsync to install an old version of any given app
jailbreak,not_removed,👍🏼
jailbreak,not_removed,🥇
jailbreak,not_removed,ok👍🏼
jailbreak,not_removed,use the httpsbetaunlimappscom repo to update app admin then i blocked the apps updates and downgraded worked for spotify
jailbreak,not_removed,httpsbetaunlimappscom
jailbreak,not_removed,try refreshing your cydia and install the latest version it works like charm to me
jailbreak,not_removed,same
jailbreak,not_removed,no dont even try installing appsync rn or else you will be stuck ina reboot loop
jailbreak,not_removed,why was he downvoted
jailbreak,not_removed,im on ipad pro when i click the old version of app it just force closed
jailbreak,not_removed,surely no i wont install appsync i just used app admin to downgrade messenger and im not seeing any results thanks anyway
jailbreak,not_removed,cause thats all rjailbreak can do aside from annoy the shit out of luck
jailbreak,not_removed,all you had to do was delete a tweak or two to free up space for coolstash then reinstall what you deleted id recommend asking ucoolstarorg for help
jailbreak,not_removed,you could find out what files cydia moves when it stashes and move them back maybe
jailbreak,not_removed,op did you ever figure this out i made a similar post yesterday and havent even gotten an unhelpful reply let alone a helpful one
jailbreak,not_removed,there is an alternative to cydia eraser but i cant remember the name
jailbreak,not_removed,too didnt long read
jailbreak,not_removed,but will it work
jailbreak,not_removed,semirestore doesnt work past
jailbreak,not_removed,ah shit sorry mate

jailbreak,not_removed,you can already scrobble your friends music with lastfm
jailbreak,not_removed,something you dont have s
jailbreak,not_removed,any more info on this
jailbreak,not_removed,not all your friends on spotify using lastfm unfortunately
jailbreak,not_removed,like what it was literally a port of the desktop friend feed to the iphone app however it was an idea that sounded good in theory but in execution it just didnt belong on mobile the advantage of the desktop app friend feed is that its always there it takes less than a second to glance at on mobile you have to actually make the extra bit of effort to swipe it in and times out of youre not going to see anything you care about which means no one would use it
jailbreak,not_removed,is there anywhere i could download that version id use it haha
jailbreak,not_removed,hidemex does it

jailbreak,not_removed,oh dang didnt notice that thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe you shouldnt have made it a link that downloads a bmp file
jailbreak,not_removed,which deviceios version
jailbreak,not_removed,where did you even find a copy of ilex rat
jailbreak,not_removed,what do you mean
jailbreak,not_removed,ilex rat can do that if and only if you didnt have find my iphone enabled you could be signed in to icloud but fmi could be disabled
jailbreak,not_removed,my mum sent me her iphone on and she forgot her apple id password and the email it was attached to was long gone but because the phone was able to get to the lock screen i was able to glitch it and turn off find my iphone and then delete here apple id and replace it with my own i couldnt believe it worked found the method on youtube replicated it twice my kids mother sent my youngest fella over with his iphone and wanted me to jailbreak it for him i told the silly cow to make sure find my iphone was turned off and she had removed her apple id of course when i got the boys back to my house i went to jailbreak it and found find my iphone was onused the same method to glitch it off and replaced it with my apple id
jailbreak,not_removed,no it didnt icloud lock persists not even a possibility that this happened the way you said it happened if find my iphone is on apple id is needed after restore whatever the chosen method of the time
jailbreak,not_removed,use this to restore your phones from now on cydia restore restore and reset ios and cydia httpcydiarestorecom
jailbreak,not_removed,ios iphone tested also on ios same phone
jailbreak,not_removed,i used ilex rat tweak to wipe my data without need of upgrade and it wiped icloud account from phones so i could bypass activation screen and log into any icloud i want
jailbreak,not_removed,no you didnt
jailbreak,not_removed,did u even watch the video he diddnt restore anything
jailbreak,not_removed,activation lock isnt active on ios edit on ios i mean so wiping an iphone on ios wont lock it if find my iphone is enabled
jailbreak,not_removed,use this to restore your phone from now on but dont use mobile terminal ssh from your computer cydia restore restore and reset ios and cydia httpcydiarestorecom
jailbreak,not_removed,so youre saying it turned off find my iphone are you sure you had it on
jailbreak,not_removed,hang on what how do you install a tweak on a icloud locked device can you explain a bit further
jailbreak,not_removed,i beg your pardon
jailbreak,not_removed,op said he used ilex icloud lock doesnt magically go away
jailbreak,not_removed,actually it can be back when activation lock was first introduced i got curious i have an iphone with full blobs from to so i turned on find my iphone put it in dfu and downgraded to ios activation lock was active same with ios activation lock is serverside so this makes sense you just cant enable it preios
jailbreak,not_removed,icloud lock exits on ios and up
jailbreak,not_removed,no
jailbreak,not_removed,im not really sure about that im sure tho that they had icloud accounts assigned
jailbreak,not_removed,i meant that after restore you could just easily activate phone and sign into any icloud account you want
jailbreak,not_removed,both phones had find my iphone on and access to the homescreen they werent icloud locked im not claiming for a second to be able to work magic and bypass icloud activation what im saying is you can glitch find my iphone off on the iphone running ios in settings without the apple id password then you can enter your new apple id then you can simply delete the itunes account that was previously on the iphone and put in the new one ive done it twice like i said once with my mums old hand me down and once with my youngest sons iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,til thanks for confirming i never knew this could be the case with activation lock preios
jailbreak,not_removed,no it was introduced after ios
jailbreak,not_removed,it really works
jailbreak,not_removed,icloud doesnt matter the deciding factor is fmi if that was off before you ran ilex then thats normal if it was on youre going to need to show some proof p
jailbreak,not_removed,i have two here tell me exactly how to do this im very skeptical
jailbreak,not_removed,this was the video i used
jailbreak,not_removed,no you didnt why even lie you think rjailbreak will think you are awesome or something
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah it surprised me too probably wouldnt have believed it if i hadnt watched it happen p
jailbreak,not_removed,happy bday sir
jailbreak,not_removed,i will try checking it in a free time will update it later
jailbreak,not_removed,ok ill help you out dm me edit ive dmed you
jailbreak,not_removed,i dunno why u doubt the guy i just tried this on my wifes and i did it on the fifth try
jailbreak,not_removed,ah the good ol days
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you for clarifying that im not a liar as that other sob implied i let him get to me i know i shouldnt have but one thing i wont be called is a liar by some ill informed wanker who thinks he knows it all like you said all he has to do is try it out himself on a device running that firmware but no he sits there with his se and just straight out calls you and i liars good on you for taking the time to reply with this vindicating comment
jailbreak,not_removed,no you didnt
jailbreak,not_removed,k
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,ya it was pretty duechey of him to just say that without even looking into it
jailbreak,not_removed,why even keep icloud on if you are going to never use the device again or keep a outdated email did she just forget
jailbreak,not_removed,if youre so fucking skeptical why dont you try it yourself ive done this method on an iphone on ios as well
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah shes old man shes and not real tech savvy
jailbreak,not_removed,no you didnt
jailbreak,not_removed,ah i see well i would not know i dont use icloud since i only have my ipad and i really dont need it super protected lol
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,she did know the password at one stage but she made it years and years ago and she just forgot it to add to that the email account was also deactivated many years ago didnt bother her as she only used the phone for basically phone calls and messages but then she bought a new and asked me if my son wanted her old phone so when i got it i took to youtube to work out how to get around the problem and i was super happy when i found the work around
jailbreak,not_removed,that is cool i always thought icloud was just to lock the account not keep you from ever using the phone again idk if that is a great idea or a bad one well i guess even the email went away you could still log in if you know the password but still i would not fuck with that xd
jailbreak,not_removed,if its not a public jailbreak then its not a jailbreak because no one sees it so hence no jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,than
jailbreak,not_removed,it is easier to jailbreak ios than ios gonna need a source on that
jailbreak,not_removed,yeh but its not public so i get its his jailbreak but it could be crashing just after video its not stable so hence its not a full jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,shittt i saw the image before title and got excited why you do dis edit also we do have a jailbreak for ios just not a public one
jailbreak,not_removed,who said it would be easier all it needs is for a couple of exploits to be patched then its a competent different jailbreak required
jailbreak,not_removed,look at qwertyoruiopzs twitter hes posted videos pictures and is always talking about tech related things including jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,f the private jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,haha me to
jailbreak,not_removed,may i ask why

jailbreak,not_removed,completely opposite help by keeping location services off and only turns them on for specific set apps
jailbreak,not_removed,jailbreak does not effect itunes capability to sync music to a device
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,im sure there is a rule number that says that discussion about forgottenlost passwords is not allowed
jailbreak,not_removed,you cant thats a lie there is no way to remove the passcode the keychain file stores all app pass codes and email passcode but the phone passcode is encrypted
jailbreak,not_removed,even still if it werent possible to remove the passcode the file is still in
jailbreak,not_removed,thats a lie that was back in the old days i bet you googled that check the date pre ios days
jailbreak,not_removed,i just did some research and according to the file on my jailbroken ipod touch running ios it doesnt appear to mention anything about about where the passcode is in keys then under the agrp section the reason i said what i said was because i had noted down not too long ago at the start of the year round about upon an article the i had discovered about where the passcode was said to be stored yes now i do realise that this not up to date and in fact yes it is of an ios tutorial apologies but i am still interested as to how it is stored on devices i have a knack that its in the secure element for newer devices but i do know yes the password is wrapped with the generated gid key that the processor only knows and its encrypted with from the processor which makes it basically impossible to encoverdecrypt but say if it were to be in the secure element that just lessens your chances of getting the passcode removed so not really doable at all edit the passcode is entangled with the devices uid so bruteforce attempts must be performed on the device under attack — apple security guide

jailbreak,not_removed,it is in the main bigboss repo however in their webpage they say they made an update for ios compatibility i dont know if it is that one or if the update is in another repo should be in the main repos according to their webpage please advise if you find any solution to the main mac spoof problem so that other users know what works
jailbreak,not_removed,better than a broken device though
jailbreak,not_removed,aw come on lol jk
jailbreak,not_removed,well purpose was to spoof the mac so when using certain wifi networks it wouldnt restrict your access ie xfinity
jailbreak,not_removed,i see
jailbreak,not_removed,i followed the exact video and my repository works just fine httplacertosusrepogithubio try restarting
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks i guess thats what i have to do now
jailbreak,not_removed,try using the appstore jailbrake app pgloader
jailbreak,not_removed,good bye
jailbreak,not_removed,its not there
jailbreak,not_removed,those down votes 😬😬😬
jailbreak,not_removed,lol
jailbreak,not_removed,mine has crashed a few times over the last hours i dont have either of the tweaks you mentioned
jailbreak,not_removed,it may also be infostats or groovylib
jailbreak,not_removed,did you update to the latest anemone
jailbreak,not_removed,i reverted all my recent tweaks and it wasnt fixed confused
jailbreak,not_removed,wait people arent using it to mean their phone is now a paperweight or in other words brick if thats the case im with you people need to stop using it that way bricked means useless and cannot be restored without serious intervention
jailbreak,not_removed,bricked you cant restore at all dfu mode doesnt work itunes is also uncooperative and you need a new iphone not bricked dfu itunes working device even if jb is lost learn the difference not doing so will cost you lots of money
jailbreak,not_removed,a viable alternative softbricked
jailbreak,not_removed,what if i drop a brick on my phone can i say it was bricked
jailbreak,not_removed,normally you would use soft brick for a recoverable state and hard brick for a completely nonrecoverable state this is accepted terminology for other devices including android phones i used that terminology here until i got into an argument with a mod who insisted on not using the word brick at all they wanted to use bootloop for everything which i detest since theres no distinction between a bootloop you can use no substrate mode to fix and a bootloop that requires a restore so because people here arent used to the idea of different brick states you get confusion like this yes im still a bit salty
jailbreak,not_removed,you will never win this battle you might as well try to except the fact that people call it bricked every time they mess up a device and it cant get on snapchat
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you its been triggering me so hard every time i see that bricking means it is literally a paper weight no one has actually bricked their phones as of yet it doesnt help that luca used that language in his release notes either but im pretty sure he meant it in the correct way
jailbreak,not_removed,remember when we did crazy things like flashing the baseband bricked certainly wasnt a term we used lightly
jailbreak,not_removed,what if it bricks my phone s
jailbreak,not_removed,non jailbroken iphone bricked
jailbreak,not_removed,ibrickapples new revolutionary product in
jailbreak,not_removed,i have an iphone that cant be restored i tried everything now thats bricked
jailbreak,not_removed,apparently if someone says its bricked they dont know it can be restored smart
jailbreak,not_removed,softbrick is the term i use
jailbreak,not_removed,well a non jailbroken iphone is pretty much unusable so yeah if youre forced to update and lose your jailbreak i feel for you but youve got a point instead of saying i bricked my phone when youre forced to update just say shit now i have to use my android instead
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,more like a sponge if anything or drying cement maybe evenwait for it lets call it putty
jailbreak,not_removed,i know we can call it clayed because for there to be a brick you have to bake the clay as in make it worse
jailbreak,not_removed,autism
jailbreak,not_removed,no if the phone can be restored its called a softbrick however at the time of that phone not being restored its bricked a phone that is not able to be restored is a hardbrick its always dead
jailbreak,not_removed,good luck with that
jailbreak,not_removed,dammit dude first correct the other dude and now you go ranting on reddit again fuck man or woman xd
jailbreak,not_removed,stop complaining about word choice let people say what they want to say especially when the common definition of bricked for iphones now is a soft brick
jailbreak,not_removed,we use bricked for a restorable device because usually the only way to properly brick an iphone is to physically destroy it and then we have a better term destroyed
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont understand people use this word because they dont know any better the terms are hard every country interpretates it different its like hacker and cheater people confuse them all the time but to be honest its not their fault it just gets used wrongly everywhere
jailbreak,not_removed,i disagree theres pretty much no way to actually brick an iphone except by dropping it in water and brick is a simple descriptive known word that means incapacitated do you have an alternative
jailbreak,not_removed,i guess people think bootloopbricked now a days and its not you said it right if it was bricked it would be a paperweight
jailbreak,not_removed,great explanation
jailbreak,not_removed,and bricked rarely happens an itunes restore works most of the time i only bricked my iphone once and that was a hardware issue
jailbreak,not_removed,its a good term to use for jailbreaking tho because if your jail cell is bricked your stuck but if you unbrick it then your jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,sounds good to me it is a software problem soft brick makes sense
jailbreak,not_removed,the community refers to bricks as hard bricks and soft bricks
jailbreak,not_removed,ive been using hardbricked and softbricked for decades now but you could also say that you hardbricked an ethernet router when you can still jtag it up and reflash the firmware to get it back running which technically wouldnt make it a hardbrick in the first placejust a pain in the ass to reflash and requires a usbjtag cable and maybe a tftp executable
jailbreak,not_removed,not bricked but yeah you say that your phone got fucked
jailbreak,not_removed,so am i do you guys ever go out or watch tv shows bricked is commonly used to refer to any nonfunctional state distinctions can be made using hard or soft brick thats just how the word is used today regardless of the definition when it was created they can cry as much as they want about it i doubt there is a way to go back now popular shows like westworld use bricked you wont suddenly convert thousands of people when someone then comes here with a question and the first thing he is told is that he wrongly uses the word bricked it makes us look smug
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i did brick a baseband with on time it sucked no fixing that
jailbreak,not_removed,then it makes a great paperweight
jailbreak,not_removed,then your processor memory chip baseband etc has failed and you need a new phonelogic board
jailbreak,not_removed,and this guy is trying to get people to understand what they mean so they dont get used wrongly everywhere
jailbreak,not_removed,softbrick there have been methods in the past to actually brick iphones but i dont think there are any at the moment
jailbreak,not_removed,yea well i mean you can still use it as a paper weight even if its not bricked in its true definition it would just be a paperweight with a screen and a shit ton of features
jailbreak,not_removed,yes as far as im aware iphones are unbrickable software wise which is why they are better than android
jailbreak,not_removed,bricking though has already been esablished as your device not working at all no need to change that consensus
jailbreak,not_removed,use in a sentence i had shots of patrón last night and got soft bricked
jailbreak,not_removed,playdoh
jailbreak,not_removed,and i thought i was hackerman with my ddwrt nighthawk router lol
jailbreak,not_removed,in the psp community it was a brick and a semibrick because the semibricks required a second psp to fix well the first time anyway never really have to undo a pandora battery if you dont want
jailbreak,not_removed,in what world is livable a synonym for viable
jailbreak,not_removed,right the terminology is commonly used in outside communities so theres no getting away from the word either way i came from an android phone that i rootedunlock bootloaderflash custom recovery etc in those communities it was very important to distinguish between soft and hard bricks ive soft bricked many android devices on accident by messing with system files and you just use custom recovery to flash a new firmware but when youre installing a custom recovery menumessing with the kernel you need to know that screwing up can result in a hard brick and unusable phone this is a smartphone subreddit its not so unreasonable to think that many of us might be coming from android people are gonna use the word brick and rather than invent new and confusing terminology we should just use whats already commonly accepted and understood even if youre not familiar with the term im pretty sure people can guess the difference between soft and hard bricking
jailbreak,not_removed,i think youre right that its already gone too far to actually change but its still frustrating theres actually no point in having the term bricked at this point if its used to represent such a widely defined set of conditions it loses its purpose as a useful descriptive term but thats just me complaining
jailbreak,not_removed,i mean i use my fully functional as a paperweight all the time
jailbreak,not_removed,yes as far as im aware iphones are unbrickable software wise why they are better than android they are brickable changing the nvram will brick it for instance
jailbreak,not_removed,can confirm
jailbreak,not_removed,when you can do some watchdog shit then youre a true hacker
jailbreak,not_removed,absolutely back in the days there even was a method to downgrade it requiring you to brick it first by pulling the cord while updating it just doesnt make sense to not acknowledge that this is how the word is used
jailbreak,not_removed,exactly
jailbreak,not_removed,it used to brick it now it doesnt after ios itunes can restore a device like that
jailbreak,not_removed,like changing its mac addresses sounds like a good thing to leave alone
jailbreak,not_removed,i think there are certain iboot things that could completely break iboot accessible from a normal jb
jailbreak,not_removed,so in better terms its impossible to brick unless you try and brick it
jailbreak,not_removed,what if i hacked the cybernet mainframe with my neural network gui interface through the secret government intranet to shut down the internet to stop isis from recruiting mexicans in america am i hackerman then
jailbreak,not_removed,exactly
jailbreak,not_removed,no but youre definitely a hero in certain peoples eyes
jailbreak,not_removed,awesome tweaks you got there i like the simple ideas already added the repo hope you make greater tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,your repo is empty
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks glad you like it
jailbreak,not_removed,nope try refreshing it
jailbreak,not_removed,can you add wifi mac address and wifi frequency or and signal strength to wijoin this eliminates the need to install other tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,i can look into that ill get back to you if i cant and if i can expect an update around friday
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,hey just as a feedback probably not going to be able to release the update up to friday but i think those features are going to be possible to implement
jailbreak,not_removed,ok ill be looking forward to your update
jailbreak,not_removed,heres as far as ive gotten with it any help would be appreciated httpiimgurcomxgnmqicjpg httpiimgurcomzkznhudjpg
jailbreak,not_removed,did you apply the emoji backup through bytafont
jailbreak,not_removed,make sure you also install the ios emoji font from cydia
jailbreak,not_removed,im also stuck here with the same shapes and letters
jailbreak,not_removed,and did you get the version for bytafont and not bytafont
jailbreak,not_removed,yes and still looks the same
jailbreak,not_removed,i think i found what your problem is you have the ios backup downloaded what you need for it to work is emoji ios backup d ios works on all versions compatible with bytafont
jailbreak,not_removed,amalthea is my favorite compatible one its as close as it gets to statusvol which was my all time favorite on ios another great but different volume tweak is volume mixer
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,volume mixer
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,statusvol x

jailbreak,not_removed,sure no problem glad to help
jailbreak,not_removed,seems a problem with virtual home service going to deep sleep after a while just my guess btw same thing has been asked several times already a quick search would have found the answer much faster xd
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah its been buggy for me too make sure you dont xmodgames that will forsure be a problem
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah mine too i asked this before no results
jailbreak,not_removed,many people says xmod was the problem i didnt believed it because i even hadnt the tweak anymore but all indicates it was recently xmod decide to upload popular fake tweaks in their repo causing some instability issues one of those i suppose was messing up with virtual home what you need to do is delete the repo of xmod i wasnt aware i still had it even when i didnt had the tweak anymore downgrade apps that it could update you need to check them out in my case were winterboard flux and bytafont until this step i still has issues with vh often forcing me to respring then i did the following get ifile or filza and delete xmhelperdylib and xmhelperplist from librarymobilesubstratedynamiclibraries that did the trick until now the issue is gone hope that helps
jailbreak,not_removed,seems to bee another tweak that was recently updated that is causing this seen a few people complaining about this issue
jailbreak,not_removed,same here
jailbreak,not_removed,the only thing i have updated recently is flux any others have also it was working fine before
jailbreak,not_removed,mine has intermittenly done this since plenty of people have said to respring or restart which is fine i have activator set up where i double tap the status bar to bring up the app switcher i found out that if vh stops working i just activate the app switcher via activator and switch to a different app times and vh will start to work again
jailbreak,not_removed,i have the same problem never installed xmod
jailbreak,not_removed,delete xmod downgrade bytafont and delete the files but the issue still persist anyone can help
jailbreak,not_removed,i had same issue solved by removing xmod game repo and all the tweak update due to that repo also deleting xmhelperdylib and xmhelperplist in librarymobilesubstratedynamiclibraries
jailbreak,not_removed,effort though
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont have it installed
jailbreak,not_removed,this fixed it in my case i only rolled back winterboard i did the remaining steps as well and it has been working for now
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for the suggestion ill try this and report back
jailbreak,not_removed,just wanted to say thanks this seems to have helped before i deleted the xmod repo you can go into that source and see which tweaks it upgraded itself i took a screen shot removed the repo and proceeded to your step i hope that more people like me this was happening to can find this post good luck
jailbreak,not_removed,which tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,i have the same problem but i dont have flex at all
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you very much youve solved my problem regards ♥
jailbreak,not_removed,then youll need to manually deactivate tweaks to find out the culprit if the problem occurred recently then i suggest you to start with the most updated tweaks recent tab on cydia
jailbreak,not_removed,read below looks like some fake updates got released on the xmods repo perhaps you updated using on of those fake tweaks sorry not sure which tweaks this entails
jailbreak,not_removed,this was even before the xmod stuff happened p i dont have xmod thats why i was asking so that i can get rid of what causing the issue xd
jailbreak,not_removed,nobody is sure your best bet is using icleaner pro to disable tweaks till you find the culprit and you didnt need xmods installed to have the issue only the repo
jailbreak,not_removed,alright no repo and no xmod but its not like its always not working sometimes it just doesnt until respring there is no fixed time when it stops working so its hard to find the culprit thanks for your tips i am on jailbreak since d i can find the issue but not enough time to test as i got plenty of tweaks p time is not on my side as i have said behavior is random sometimes virtualhome works for days without a problem so yeah xd quick respring through control center is good for time being d
jailbreak,not_removed,try deleting the pirated repo
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry bud but no piracy allowed here cant help you
jailbreak,not_removed,how much space do you have left in you might be running out of space in
jailbreak,not_removed,we hate piracy bro
jailbreak,not_removed,honestly stay on your untethered until this jailbreak gets sorted out there are so many more errors that usual and its just not worth the time and effort it would take to fix when it breaks with lots of reports of loss of battery life and slow connections after jailbreaking give it a month or so until these problems get cleared up
jailbreak,not_removed,id say update to the latest ios has made my come back to alive and if you jailbreak wait dont do it now just see what is gonna happen with security
jailbreak,not_removed,the only disadvantage at this point is that you wont have latest ios but it is up to you if you like latest features or not in the matter of jailbreak itself id say that upgrading is not a good idea most of tweaks are now supported for previous jailbreak and untether is way more stable
jailbreak,not_removed,you have a you even have a device on jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,bug fixes and security fixes your reasons tweaks are being updated not like that takes long
jailbreak,not_removed,id tell him to stay too my has no issues not a fan of semitethered or all this certificate uncertainty
jailbreak,not_removed,yes thats what i also meant by latest features d anyway for now i would stay on more stable version than having many issues with outdated tweaks that semiuntether thing is not that big problem but still it is not that stable now
jailbreak,not_removed,its not semi tether like the old days you needed a pc to boot people need to get over that stigma if tapping an app and locking the screen is too hard for a semi tether the world is getting to a sad state
jailbreak,not_removed,its not stable when people try to install stuff that hasnt been updated but they do it anyway like someone asked if bite works on yesterday they be stuck unner a rock yo some jailbreak then queue up tweaks at once some load up on the piracy tools then they whine its theres many of us running stable as can be that install stuff slowly and test moral instability is usually operator error aka pebcak
jailbreak,not_removed,semiuntethered point if you had the option would you honestly chose this over a regular untethered also not having to worry if pp is sketchy
jailbreak,not_removed,oh god dude please stop telling people to update is it user error that the pp app wont reapply the jailbreak is it user error that tweaks stop working at night while still in a jailbroken state the jailbreak is unstable at the moment and needs work like every new jailbreak and advising anyone its perfectly stable is just straight out untruthful
jailbreak,not_removed,chicken and the egg argument there wont be an untether as there is issues defeating kpp if you had read up you would know this method works around kpp regarding pp and sketchy too many with the tin foil hats on overly tight no evidence speculation and fearmongering and it worked cause you are afraid of it
jailbreak,not_removed,most of the reason to update is the tiff exploit not a jailbreak exploit can be used for bad things and wasnt patched till
jailbreak,not_removed,i have its why it has to be side loaded with sketchy certificates its not so much being afraid as it is that my current version works flawlessly without extra steps or any worrieshonestly you could defend this method all you want but to me it feels like a rushed product that still needs time to smooth out while my current version works imo better so no need to upgradeyet
jailbreak,not_removed,the tiff bug that we have a fix for already no big problem there oh just a fyi its a tiff bug very common mistake see you have a bugor whatever they call it and then you write an exploit to make it useful the exploit is not the mistake in coding but the thing you write to make that bug useful to make it shorter you dont find exploits you find bugs and then you exploit the bugs
jailbreak,not_removed,its not sketchy its pangus enterprise cert the same kind ibm or walmart would pay for lemme sned you a bad tiff file that should be enough motivation to go to but if not enjoy buggy and the wish i woulda upgraded feeling when isnt current anymore and you are back to stuck waiting
jailbreak,not_removed,lol no apples code doesnt check length allowing a buffer overflow and code execution the way you put it everything has a bug the exploit just hasnt been created
jailbreak,not_removed,damn i love when someone doesnt know but will argue anyway httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiexploitcomputersecurity that should explain it cause i really thought i explained it good enough we find a bug and write something to exploit it limerain was a dfu exploit that attacked a bug in dfu
jailbreak,not_removed,its broke its been broke for awhile now from what ive heard
jailbreak,not_removed,mine isnt working too and hasnt for a while
jailbreak,not_removed,its been broken for a long time i wish saurik would fix it
jailbreak,not_removed,only thing you can do is wait on saurik to fix it
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah unfortunately broke there was the alternative but seems to be broke as well
jailbreak,not_removed,im not happy either paid cydia nothing works no free apps what the hell is going on sending emails not received anything i want my that i contributed back
jailbreak,not_removed,ya know big s is to politics nowadayshe has no time to maintain or improve cydia to keep the user experience fresh
jailbreak,not_removed,tweak hub could not find info about this tweaktheme bleep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot

jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i noticed that too you have to buy everything not trying to buy tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,i have the same problem
jailbreak,not_removed,youre gonna wanna backup your itunes library file itunes libraryitl downgrade and then copy that itunes library back again and see if that works make sure to make a backup of this file just in case
jailbreak,not_removed,tried that it says that it cant read libraries created by newer versions of itunes
jailbreak,not_removed,an update will be pushed to the bigboss repo soon to correct this issue if youre impatient you can download the latest icleaner pro beta from my beta repository httpibsoftnetcydiabeta
jailbreak,not_removed,have you tried rebooting your phone
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks so much for your reply
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah ive rebooted redone the jb after reboot and still nothing im puzzled
jailbreak,not_removed,if you see connect to itunes thats recovery mode you should be able to just restore it normally with itunes or attempt to update it if you want to try and pull data off
jailbreak,not_removed,even if no pls recovery was on you could still go into dfu mode to restore it i assume you are simply not doing dfu mode right man take it slow if you need a step by step ill be happy to explain how i do it
jailbreak,not_removed,when i try to the computer says extracting software which completes then it says preparing iphone for software update which is interrupted almost immediately with an error reading the iphone iphone could not be updated an unknown error occurred
jailbreak,not_removed,would you be willing to thank you so far i think its like this hold power for seconds hold both power and home for then hold just home for do i start that process from recovery mode or does the phones screen have to be black
jailbreak,not_removed,if you have another computer try using it to restore your phone instead make sure you have the latest version of itunes your firewallantivirus is disabled and make sure you dont have an apple entries in your hosts file assuming youve ever made any changes to it otherwise follow apples instructions
jailbreak,not_removed,ok plug the phone in the computer and this is what i do i press the power button but the moment i press it i then press the home button and i count to even when the screen goes black i keep counting once i hit i let go of the power button and i keep holding the home button then itunes will say you are in recovery mode then just simply restore
jailbreak,not_removed,i did that and everything was working like you said but it gave me error this time thoughts
jailbreak,not_removed,error huh mm try using a ipsw instead
jailbreak,not_removed,how im on a mac
jailbreak,not_removed,do you have the ipsw installed if you dont go on ipswnet look for ios or ios for youre phone model then once its done place it some where you can remember then go on itunes and control click the restore button i think its control click on mac then you look for the ipsw click on it and it will start the restore
jailbreak,not_removed,ipsw is downloading ill update you when i do the next step thank you for your help
jailbreak,not_removed,np hope it works
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah still getting error i am sort of lost as to what to do i was planning on taking the phone into the apple store anyway if i take it in now wont they know that its been jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,mm maybe not if you put it in dfu mode and say it wont restore also i read it could be the pc or the port or even the charger
jailbreak,not_removed,im going to try tinyumbrella and see if that works thanks for your time man
jailbreak,not_removed,np man sorry for not being much help
jailbreak,not_removed,funny how you buy a phone and yet the manufacturer feels the need to tell you how and where you can use it nonsense patent the feature would be a gimmick like many of the ios features and at the end of the day it would just be more harm than good when and if it makes it to the market
jailbreak,not_removed,drm for your camera
jailbreak,not_removed,this takes it too far if this is true
jailbreak,not_removed,this has already been in the news about years ago and been speculated for the iphone dont worry it wont hapen
jailbreak,not_removed,this patent was submitted and approved over years ago
jailbreak,not_removed,this is really old news
jailbreak,not_removed,even if this made it anywhere now old patent like stated by many others we have real cameras still you dont need your phone to be a camera
jailbreak,not_removed,so what turn off your location services so that way apple doesnt know where u are and you can film the event
jailbreak,not_removed,the post stated that it would use infrared signals from the stageobject being recorded and that would apply a watermark or disable the phones camera in general location services had nothing to do with the post
jailbreak,not_removed,i agree with you i dont let app store auto update either
jailbreak,not_removed,neither do i ill update most app store apps without thought unless its one that has a tweak appliedlike youtube etc
jailbreak,not_removed,i havent upgraded my instagram yet hate the new icon thank god i can apply them now atleast
jailbreak,not_removed,what
jailbreak,not_removed,wot
jailbreak,not_removed,im trying to see if i can recreate the exploit the was inspired by jailbreakme but i dont have a updated cydia file to do this nevermind found it
jailbreak,not_removed,in da but
jailbreak,not_removed,best comment of the day
jailbreak,not_removed,wasnt aware that had been updated since this could be why try contacting the dev via cydia
jailbreak,not_removed,its says that it might not for properlyit works for some not allit worked for me but kinda laggy so i use medusa instead
jailbreak,not_removed,it works perfectly for me except for whatsapp though i can type and send messages through the whatsapp head but those messages dont get delivered remain inside whatsapp app with red error icon and also even if you turn off whatsapp from settings of message heads the whatsapp head pops when a message is received
jailbreak,not_removed,idk about you but i never use rotation especially if your on a plus unless its for taking pictures for me i can watch videos play games etc and works fine its only for pictures but i click the disable rotation boom i can take pictures landscape style idk its your choice is using your phone in landscape mode that important for me my priorities are quick reply not rotation everyones different
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackageorgthebigbossmessageheads bigboss tweaks chat heads for messages ¯ツ¯ type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,with no rotation systemwide
jailbreak,not_removed,you can mirror your phone to your pcmac and then mirror that to chromecast lol
jailbreak,not_removed,it would require hardware to mirror it to a tv like an apple tv tvs only display video signals not grab them out of the air mirroring your device best thing to do is hook your computer up to the tv and mirror it to your computer a free tweak on a virtual store wont do it by itself its simply not possible sorry for the disappointment
jailbreak,not_removed,easily possible for free provided you have a computer hooked to your tv and a wireless network
jailbreak,not_removed,op might be asking to mirror to the chrome cast im not sure tho as it wasnt very clear
jailbreak,not_removed,well thats on chromecast unless someone does some fuckery with how chromecast sees a youtube stream then jack the source with the ios mirror sounds sketchy as frig but someone might be able to do it i dont have enough time or skill on my hands thats for sure
jailbreak,not_removed,fuckin i wish canuckistan land of the canadian peso your best bet is to get an apple tv buy one used for like if youre cheap and you are home free waiting for some tweak takes more than person to want it in the first place then you have to get someone with a big enough noggin to figure it out for ya
jailbreak,not_removed,no unless you have shsh blobs saved from before
jailbreak,not_removed,look and see if coolbooter will let you i dont know if an iphone is bit or not if it is it should work as i have downgraded my iphone with no blobs it allows having both firmwares fyi
jailbreak,not_removed,you can use coolbooter i did it on my on ios and i dual booted to ios coolbooter requires ios as the minimum so youre good just make sure you have enough space in your device i did a semi restore before running and the second partition is only and in the ios partition
jailbreak,not_removed,coolbooter allows you to dualboot into ios as for actually downgrading to it theres nothing much you can do
jailbreak,not_removed,awww i never knew about that
jailbreak,not_removed,great thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone is
jailbreak,not_removed,ok thanks im just waiting for my to turn on
jailbreak,not_removed,can you also post if it works for you
jailbreak,not_removed,if i could only have jailbreak tweak it would be gridswitcher without question but it looks like the dev has stopped work on it unconfirmed theory as it was last updated in jan and was made free griddy looks to be extremely similar and alympus by tweaks is a mashup of gridswitcher and auxo unfortunately they both dont work on yet afaik apparently cpdigitaldarkroom has been working on something similar too but i dont know much about it
jailbreak,not_removed,yes id used gridswitcher that is the most lovely switcher tweaks i think until yesterday but well ill wait for update and release
jailbreak,not_removed,a full ios with a computer not a restore from backup not an update not a reset all content and settings on the device will remove cydia itll also put you on the latest ios so if you want to jailbreak in the near future dont do it
jailbreak,not_removed,whats your ios version and device
jailbreak,not_removed,cydia crashes because you need to resign with impactor the yalu app if you want to restore put your iphone into dfu and force it to restore
jailbreak,not_removed,do you have managing accounts locked in restrictions because if so then thatll disable making any changes to that just the first thought that popped up in my head though im not sure
jailbreak,not_removed,had the same problem i was able to log in through the appstore app itself at the very bottom of the featured tab
jailbreak,not_removed,do you have app admin if you have it remove it
jailbreak,not_removed,do you have any restriction locks enabled
jailbreak,not_removed,try to disable low power mode and try again
jailbreak,not_removed,had a similar problem restart your phone it will open again
jailbreak,not_removed,you tried to sign into one of those accounts that is locked do a reboot
jailbreak,not_removed,well i just got my plus last week and it came with got it at bestbuy upgraded from plus
jailbreak,not_removed,i ordered a jet black iphone from applecom directly on the it came in yesterday and it had if you can go to a brick and mortar store you can ask for one with a serial number that guarantees you you have to find the thread someone had a certain serial number thing you had to look for
jailbreak,not_removed,relatively high because ios has just been stopped about a week ago
jailbreak,not_removed,its limited for bit devices which are iphone and newer
jailbreak,not_removed,follow httpiphonedevwikinetindexphpsshoverusb and download an sftp client such as httpscyberduckiolen open an sftp connection to your device navigate to systemlibrary onidevice copy the linguisticdata folder to your computer delete the linguisticdata folder from your idevice navigate to varmobile onidevice copy the linguisticdata from your computer into varmobile delete the linguisticdata folder from your computer open cydia upgrade all packages that need to be upgraded install cydia substrate
jailbreak,not_removed,you dont have enough space on system partition you need stashing
jailbreak,not_removed,by the way this is completely safe it will just disable autocorrect until you either free up some space another way and move the folder back or just symlink it back also if you plan on using you must move it back
jailbreak,not_removed,im now getting the error that i cannot delete linguisticdata
jailbreak,not_removed,i cant even install that that gives me the errors as well

jailbreak,not_removed,were you able to open an sftp connection to your device with the ssh over usb tutorial
jailbreak,not_removed,send screenshots
jailbreak,not_removed,httpimgurcomfxeuaqb
jailbreak,not_removed,get and you should get hacks you need
jailbreak,not_removed,are you talking about the imessage ball cause i need that tweak in my life
jailbreak,not_removed,no mini clip ball pool
jailbreak,not_removed,lol is broken and bad
jailbreak,not_removed,fled is working fine on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,ive heard otherwise
jailbreak,not_removed,its been updated for iso and works perfectly
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiaupdatesnetpkgcydia download the latest deb from here and install with either filza ifile or terminal if you have them installed
jailbreak,not_removed,deleted
jailbreak,not_removed,just run it once after first jailbreaking afterwards no more need to fix the cellular data issues
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont think so you can recursively chmod using the command chmod r path
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks a lot for quick help much appreciately do you also know whether i can revert the permission on the folder back to its original after imessage facetime is activated
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks not exactly what i was asking i am trying not to chmod everything wondering what is the minimal thing that requires
jailbreak,not_removed,i left it as be after doing it whats your reason for reverting the permissions
jailbreak,not_removed,im pretty sure the tutorial links to a tweet by luca describing exactly which directories need to be to chmodded
jailbreak,not_removed,ever notice how junkies are the best people when theres plenty of drugs
jailbreak,not_removed,theres wonderful people out there who offer their expertise and go above and beyond to help a person and then theres assholes who instead of helping out they put in their non irrelevant ass opinion
jailbreak,not_removed,was a good hit
jailbreak,not_removed,there are a lot of people who offer their best guess too im all for helping out anyone with any issues i get upset when supposed expert opinions are given when its just something someone heard about and hasnt tested or know if it is actually helping i wouldnt have my glorious crashfree relatively jailbreak without the help of more experienced smarter developers packages installed at last count if you dont know dont post a response rjailbreak is about more than karma does down voting this comment mean im wrong lol kids will be kids
jailbreak,not_removed,yup couldnt agree more lots of fake facts going around lately its irresponsible really but unfortunately seems like theres no stopping it
jailbreak,not_removed,manually install the deb for ifile and change your plist file back to your original ios version thats why it isnt smart to change it
jailbreak,not_removed,if you have apple file counduit and itoolsifunbox you could use a pcmac to browse your root system files and change back the ios version do not attempt to reboot your phone before change it back or you will end up in a boot loop and next time think carefully about doing stuff like this one if you want to keep your jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,and how do i do that please send me a pm if you can explaining me
jailbreak,not_removed,so if i dont have afc im pretty much fucked
jailbreak,not_removed,you would either need apple file conduit installed or openssh if you dont you are out of luck
jailbreak,not_removed,is there a way to re jailbreak without updating the phone then
jailbreak,not_removed,not that i know of but try to search this sub searching will also show you the dangers of changing your system version
jailbreak,not_removed,he changes his mac address
jailbreak,not_removed,just reinstall it with the app on your pc
jailbreak,not_removed,enpanguio
jailbreak,not_removed,this plug the phone in and click the middle one in the row of the one the looks like the app on the phone
jailbreak,not_removed,ios latest version of phantom lite from cokepokes beta repo snap from unlimapps has never had the issue only phantom any help is appreciated
jailbreak,not_removed,you have a signed app if you want the its not a year see
jailbreak,not_removed,may i ask what dark mode tweak is this that you are using on your device thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for the quick reply however i used the chinese version of the pp jailbreak i thought that one was the month one
jailbreak,not_removed,its just set to midnight
jailbreak,not_removed,if you dont see a profile there it means you have a free dev account signed ipa free ones disappear enterprise doesnt
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you just follow that tutorial and i now have that profile listed thanks for the help it means a lot
jailbreak,not_removed,no problem enjoy
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,you cant use the latest if youre on t mobile on ios it will bootloop your device only way to use it is to update
jailbreak,not_removed,so what is the latest bundle for ios thats available
jailbreak,not_removed,the latest for sprint is also for ios
jailbreak,not_removed,from what i see the latest bundle for ios is
jailbreak,not_removed,on ios dp beta it is sprint
jailbreak,not_removed,you might be able to by finding the directory of the audio file and replacing it with your own using filzaifile
jailbreak,not_removed,create a theme with a folder uisounds copy the naming structure of systemlibraryaudiouisounds
jailbreak,not_removed,how is this jailbreak related
jailbreak,not_removed,mmm you cant change it if youre not jailbroken you cant get ifile or filza without jb
jailbreak,not_removed,im jailbroken i did it before on ios jailbreak i believe with ifile but idk how to do it using filza on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,when you manage to access system files without being jailbroken thats when this wont be
jailbreak,not_removed,im jailbroken i did it before on ios jailbreak i believe with ifile but idk how to do it using filza on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,im pretty sure you can change it in sounds tab in settings app
jailbreak,not_removed,im afraid you are wrong
jailbreak,not_removed,no you cant
jailbreak,not_removed,it has to do with launch deamons i reinstall mobile substrate and rocketbootstrap and then enable substrate it enables it more reliably
jailbreak,not_removed,usrlibexecsubstrate killall springboard
jailbreak,not_removed,there is a fix command you could make to automatically type the things from above if you search youll surely find it
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt seem to like it any ideas edit tried to su and run this again but its not accepting my password fml lol
jailbreak,not_removed,i have one setup but it doesnt cover this scenario have searched but maybe im not using the right search terms tried the command posted here but it freaks out
jailbreak,not_removed,hidemex theres some tweaks where you can color it too p check flex
jailbreak,not_removed,the reddit app on my iphone already has infinite scrolling what are you talking about
jailbreak,not_removed,uh what
jailbreak,not_removed,if you go to the main page of reddit where all the subs are and keep scrolling down you will come to a point where it wont load any further content
jailbreak,not_removed,same as facebook go to your facebook page your news feed to be precise and if you keep scrolling you will reach a point where the same thing happens i could make a video of it if you dont know wha my i mean
jailbreak,not_removed,i better re word this post and try again
jailbreak,not_removed,is this stickied to the bottom cuz nothing will load underneath it
jailbreak,not_removed,whats that mate i deleted the post and tried to reword it better
jailbreak,not_removed,on the front page of the reddit app i cant scroll any further back than a story that was posted hours ago it has a picture of a revolver style handgun i cant scroll any further back than that are you saying you can
jailbreak,not_removed,try these words is it possible to enable infinite scrolling on fbreddit apps
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i can i just tested down to stories days old it does pause at a bottom before it loads more stories and the bottom is no longer the bottom this repeats as it only loads more when you scroll down as you scroll down
jailbreak,not_removed,i discovered that it was because i had reddit set on top stories and changing it to something else let me go back a lot further however i just tested facebook again and i can hit that limit on the newsfeed by scrolling quickly for about two minutes solid i get a dot at the bottom of the page under the last post and when i try and scroll the dot turns into a scroll wheel for a second then just reverts back to a dot would you mind testing your fb app on the news feed to see if its just my phone mate
jailbreak,not_removed,i wouldnt mind except i dont have the facebook app that app is a god damn virus what in gods name are you trying to find that takes more than minutes of hyper scrolling to reach
jailbreak,not_removed,lol that was just the easiest way to explain it it takes me ages of normal reading and browsing to reach that point but when i do in like why the fuck does it randomly stop here
jailbreak,not_removed,there isnt one pangu is responsible for the only tool
jailbreak,not_removed,what device if its an iphone you can use and then install the pangu untether via cydia pangu is down possibly for good not sure when this current jailbreak dropped so did pangus server for jailbreaks
jailbreak,not_removed,and its currently down xd
jailbreak,not_removed,which app
jailbreak,not_removed,that looks a lot like slader a cheaters favorite app
jailbreak,not_removed,hopefully covering everything from but we shall see im honestly not expecting anything but that is just me i have plenty of other things to keep me busy in the mean time let the down votes come for me speaking my mind
jailbreak,not_removed,im a bit behind whats going on
jailbreak,not_removed,and why july
jailbreak,not_removed,theyre going to talk about a hardware exploit for apple cameras there has not been any confirmation on them releasing a jailbreak and i wouldnt expect them to do so
jailbreak,not_removed,would this camera exploit along with the gas gauge exploit and the webkit exploit be enough to make a jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,im not expecting a jailbreak on that day specifically do they usually release one on such conferences but maybe in a week or so d
jailbreak,not_removed,up vote for speaking your mind
jailbreak,not_removed,pangu is giving a talk that day
jailbreak,not_removed,canada day special
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks friend lol
jailbreak,not_removed,they will give a talk but they might not release a tool they never actually release one in the mosec
jailbreak,not_removed,oh sweet zombie jesus let it be true
jailbreak,not_removed,i think you are out of luck by the moment and you cant use itunes anymore you may need to wait for prometheus tool to be available source

jailbreak,not_removed,as i understand downgrading isnt possible indeed but upgrading from jb to with working touch id should be possible by following this comprehensive tutorial
jailbreak,not_removed,i saved my blobs for

jailbreak,not_removed,thanks but does it work on
jailbreak,not_removed,it is legit keep trying until it works
jailbreak,not_removed,no need to do the date truck just enable airplane mode when status showing installing under the app
jailbreak,not_removed,mine is surprisingly on i can do anything
jailbreak,not_removed,by the way someone said he was doing a jailbreak tools called trident maybe blablai dont think it is true its fake and it made many fake news spreading in chinait is just a root access tool with trident exploit god bless the guy who lied
jailbreak,not_removed,just did this from to will post easy tutorial soon gotta go to supermarket to get something for new years first
jailbreak,not_removed,really wish it was for since thats where most users are
jailbreak,not_removed,heres some bad code for it with a few extra kernel patches you can skip the need for idevicediagnostics
jailbreak,not_removed,anyone able to download these and upload them to mediafire or mega i dont understand the language so i cant make a login to download the file
jailbreak,not_removed,ipad
jailbreak,not_removed,ipad is also working
jailbreak,not_removed,can the ipad do this same cpu
jailbreak,not_removed,can this be done with devices other than
jailbreak,not_removed,can i use this on iphone for coolbooter installation
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,nice work very clever chinese people
jailbreak,not_removed,download link
jailbreak,not_removed,can i try downgrading my iphone from ios to ios
jailbreak,not_removed,i have an ip in i think i can do the trident root but i dont know if ill can use odysseusota to downgrade it i read the model have problems if i cant use it ill wait the full jailbreak and use beehind someine can help me with more info thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks a bunch this is exactly what i am looking for
jailbreak,not_removed,so can you downgrade to ios on iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work on
jailbreak,not_removed,this is so unclear
jailbreak,not_removed,does it work with ipad plzzzz answer
jailbreak,not_removed,do not listen to this man it is fake i just went through all this shitty chinese website looking for anything and there is nothing do not believe this man and just wait for trident to be compatible with your device if it is not yet
jailbreak,not_removed,do you need to be jailbroken to start
jailbreak,not_removed,yesyou can
jailbreak,not_removed,did you use an device waiting for your tutorial but first make your purchases
jailbreak,not_removed,if you could make a tutorial that will be awesome i have no idea how to load the ipa with cydia impactor take your time cheers
jailbreak,not_removed,looking forward to your tutorial i been waiting to downgrade for a long time
jailbreak,not_removed,i think user would better waiting the jailbreak from friedappleteamyou can follow their twitter
jailbreak,not_removed,the trident jb relies on the pegasus exploit that was patched on
jailbreak,not_removed,my understanding is that i run this on my device then use odysseus
jailbreak,not_removed,hiyou are the man who help many people downgrade their on twitteri know you and i was asked for your helpbut i have no macosso i cant downgrade my can you help us add support for itthanks
jailbreak,not_removed,the guy who made tridentkloaderipa is a high school student from chinahe also made a dualboot for and released it earlier than your coolbooter i think you too can be friend and communit with some technology or something elsehe called himself
jailbreak,not_removed,i can vist some chinese forbidden websitewhich one i can upload the files maybe i can try it after my workabout four hours later
jailbreak,not_removed,if trident and odysseus support your device i think it will work
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,you can try what worked for me here
jailbreak,not_removed,may be you better to look the trident project in githubmade by some guy named benjaminprobably this name
jailbreak,not_removed,you can try what worked for me here
jailbreak,not_removed,absolutely
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe also can worki think
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont think sobecause this is not a jaibreakit just make your device entry some special mode
jailbreak,not_removed,you can already pangu jailbreak and downgrade
jailbreak,not_removed,but the trident and kloader is the important thing
jailbreak,not_removed,i have heard if your iphone was and upon when you buy itor and laterthen may not work
jailbreak,not_removed,i cant because my device is and trident has not support my device yet
jailbreak,not_removed,may you want look my another post
jailbreak,not_removed,sorrybut i can not translate the tutorial very clearbecause i dont know some special words in english the whole process is almost like what i said
jailbreak,not_removed,someone must understand it immediately when they seeing that thread
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe you should check the trident project on github by benjamin
jailbreak,not_removed,you can try what worked for me here
jailbreak,not_removed,do you know what hehe means in chinese
jailbreak,not_removed,silly baby
jailbreak,not_removed,do u even know chinese？ stop spamming brainless arguments before really trying it wimpy kid
jailbreak,not_removed,you can downgrade without jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,have shouldnt make any difference though tutorial at
jailbreak,not_removed,tutorial at
jailbreak,not_removed,tutorial at
jailbreak,not_removed,it was patched in ios i think
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,why are we drooling over tethered untethered
jailbreak,not_removed,i got the files now but i cant seem to get it to go into deep sleep mode on iphone ios
jailbreak,not_removed,you a fraud give me a legit download link or a video tutorial and i will believe you
jailbreak,not_removed,waoiphone gengeneral master
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you so much i followed the instructions stepbystep with no error on windows worked perfectly you have no idea how much i missed on my old iphone cant believe how smooth and fast it is while was laggy as hell now i just need to download tool to jb and thats it cheers happy new year d
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah accidentally typed thanks for correcting me
jailbreak,not_removed,no according author saidthe new version will show a tips like waiting for deep sleep modethen you need use odysseus and one tool named idevicediagnosticstype a command in terminal or cmd to make your device entry deep sleep modeplease look the thread that i post macos and windows has different command
jailbreak,not_removed,then go back to and enjoy the smooth
jailbreak,not_removed,this is a video tutorial in chinese
jailbreak,not_removed,i am not fraudand i come here for ask helpbecause my on
jailbreak,not_removed,got it working now im back on ios on iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,wow that helps so much
jailbreak,not_removed,how did you do it
jailbreak,not_removed,its pretty difficult understanding chinese can you help me
jailbreak,not_removed,congratulations
jailbreak,not_removed,i think i can do it when i go homeabout three hours later
jailbreak,not_removed,i think you may say something to me
jailbreak,not_removed,its probably emojis google the emojis on ios and and bytafont to install
jailbreak,not_removed,all emojis or just some
jailbreak,not_removed,just some on ios edit is there anyway to fix this problem
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i posted the deb file for you the best way to test if its a tweak or not messing you up is boot into no substrate or stock ios and send a few test messages worse comes to worse reset network settings turn on airplane mode turn off imessage if its on reboot enter jb mode then turn off airplane mode and try again
jailbreak,not_removed,yes to which one
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,i posted the link
jailbreak,not_removed,no
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you so much this one works
jailbreak,not_removed,no

jailbreak,not_removed,im trying to go from this is the command that i used futurerestore t b p buildmanifestplist s m buildmanifestplist w however ive been told that this non jb method only works for iphone so i just stopped trying and i cant get the jb method working as it said failed to get kernel base address while trying to use the nonceenabler
jailbreak,not_removed,looks just like my input then again you are on a very different device with mine being so much newer may i ask where you got your futurerestore program from ps i have an iphone on and unfortunately i jailbroke with pp back then but from my understanding rejailbreaking with taig should enable on the jailbreak maybe you could look into that to get the nonceenabler method working on your device
jailbreak,not_removed,i got it from as i got seg fault with the original one yeah i feel you as i forgot which tool i used to jailbreak edit if you got any dependencies issue check the replies i got mine fixed
jailbreak,not_removed,i see thats the same version i am using too makes it even stranger it works on yours but not mine good luck
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe it just doesnt work on ipad pro
jailbreak,not_removed,are you using phantom or any snap tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,this is a known issue with the jailbreak and the camera there has never been a fix or a true reason as to why it happens but its just something you have to live with if youd like to continue using a jailbroken device small price to pay i say
jailbreak,not_removed,this happened to be with phantom lite on but it works fine now
jailbreak,not_removed,none at all substrate is killed to make sure of that
jailbreak,not_removed,aw man

jailbreak,not_removed,https tor paid vpn as blockers all combat this this morning i installed a tweak called to delete location history not sure if its working since it hasnt been updated in a long while there are steps to help protect yourself and im sure there will be tweaks like httpseverywhere that will be used as a plugin on ios soon or a standalone tweak just give it time until then research a good subscription to a vpn and have a good adblocker like mine which blocks government spyware etc etc
jailbreak,not_removed,so its only unencryptedhttp data didnt know that
jailbreak,not_removed,canadamasterrace
jailbreak,not_removed,i use adblock by futuremind appstore and my own host blocker
jailbreak,not_removed,how about tunnelbear
jailbreak,not_removed,what is the adblocker you are using
jailbreak,not_removed,brave browser and endless browser both have a httpseverywhere addon installed those are the only two ios apps that im aware of that have the addon brave browser also has addons for blocking fingerprinting phishing scripts and adstrackers endless browser is definitely a good privacy focused browser too but it just has the httpseverywhere addon by default tho it appears that it may be tweakable its a very lightweight browser app very minimal which is good but brave is wonderful and has a much more polished ui
jailbreak,not_removed,it does have that feature and a flipswitch on ios for httpsonly would be great
jailbreak,not_removed,yep thats my understanding of it atleast httpsyoutubebdvkkrmjeem does a pretty good job of explaining the concept just substitute the word hacker for isp and youve got basically the same thing
jailbreak,not_removed,no its both but https brings more privacy in the sense that they wont know what specific content you load from a given server theyll know youre on pornhub but not the kind of porn youre watching basically
jailbreak,not_removed,ya id not be shocked no matter what you do internet data will be collected
jailbreak,not_removed,openvpn connect is great for installing ovpn files thru itunes then brave browser and endless both have httpseverywhere but i agree it would be great if there was a universal switch for it the brave browser ios app also has switches for blocking adstrackers scripts phishing and fingerprint protection
jailbreak,not_removed,i agree that canada is better than the us but you also cant act like this bill doesnt set a precedent for other countries if this does get signed by trump we can probably expect other countries to introduce similar legislation
jailbreak,not_removed,minnesotamasterrace
jailbreak,not_removed,firefox focus can work as an ad blocker for safari but i would recommend the brave browser app or endless browser
jailbreak,not_removed,you have to go with a paid vpn maintaining servers isnt cheap and they would have to be selling user data to provide a free vpn service also you definitely dont want a vpn provider that is based out of the usa or uk
jailbreak,not_removed,this is a ridiculous example
jailbreak,not_removed,only if the search provider and resulting website are not using https otherwise they only see the very first transaction before ssl is established also any sub uri they cannot see as it is part of the ssl encrypted transaction lesson is use https wherever possible
jailbreak,not_removed,not sure about op but ublock origin is the one i use
jailbreak,not_removed,they ccan still see the whole link so technically they know the porn youre watching
jailbreak,not_removed,multiple us states have already passed legislation restricting or banning this behavior from isps so i dont see it gaining a lot of traction worldwide
jailbreak,not_removed,possible but i just cant see the canadian governent doing that ps remember edward snowden lol
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for the tips
jailbreak,not_removed,i use opera a free norwegian vpn
jailbreak,not_removed,but not one that is outside the realm of possibility
jailbreak,not_removed,but the supremacy clause of the constitution says that where there is a clear disagreement between state and federal law federal law is supreme its the same thing with marijuana multiple states have legalized it and the federal government is basically just not doing anything about it yet whenever they want though the feds can crack down on the states and shut down their legal weed and the states have no legal recourse edit the supremacy clause actually doesnt pertain to this particular issue look at reply to this
jailbreak,not_removed,true i bet canada has much stricter anticorruption laws than we do and oh yes i remember edward snowden the whistleblowing national hero whos still considered an enemy of the american people by government officials still waiting for a presidential pardon for him
jailbreak,not_removed,congress didnt prevent laws from being made regarding isps collecting data they just said the fcc cant do it states are free to pass privacy laws and there isnt a conflict with federal privacy laws because there are none

jailbreak,not_removed,appsync unified could not find info about this tweaktheme fuck it ship it type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,this is appsync bootloop
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah dont use it
jailbreak,not_removed,what font is that
jailbreak,not_removed,its caused by one of your tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,love is complicated again
jailbreak,not_removed,same thing happened to me i uninstalled since it was causing a conflict with another tweak not sure if any of the other notification banner slimmer tweaks will cause this issue when replying through the notification center i havent tested any others
jailbreak,not_removed,im not sure but think is spotlight serch in settings general serch spotlight turn off contacts n re check if steel cpu dam
jailbreak,not_removed,just disabled the launch daemon i dont even use spotlight
jailbreak,not_removed,turn off notifications for pangu and try it
jailbreak,not_removed,if the above doesnt work try the following turn off your device completely turn it back on holding the volume up button when the apple logo appears let go the power button but keep pressing the volume up button until your lock screens shows up unlock your device kill all the apps completely open pp app and do the normal procedure for jailbreaking your device note if that doesnt work try closing all your apps before turning your device off
jailbreak,not_removed,try masterball
jailbreak,not_removed,delete the game and xcon redownload xcon redownload the game this worked for me back when the updated jb detection came out i also have masterball installed but im not entirely sure that it does anything anymore since i couldnt open the app without also having xcon

jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,just buy a card and give that away like with the
jailbreak,not_removed,good call i think this is the answer im looking for now its just a matter of finding a dev to offer it to maybe i could post a new posting
jailbreak,not_removed,im in americausahow do i go about doing this im not sure if i need to reiterate this but the credit is already on my account this isnt like gifting an unused gift card
jailbreak,not_removed,not really i already have the credit applied to my account i want to essentially transfer the credit balance to somebody else eta this appears to be the answerjust not the answer i was hoping for
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont understand i have on my account buying a card sounds like paying an additional which i am trying to avoid
jailbreak,not_removed,buy a card with the u have u cant transfer funds
jailbreak,not_removed,gotcha okay this is probably the answer i am looking for

jailbreak,not_removed,need this
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,this is the main reason to jailbreak for
jailbreak,not_removed,need this
jailbreak,not_removed,this has to be made
jailbreak,not_removed,gpsprivacy toggle too

jailbreak,not_removed,this is already made
jailbreak,not_removed,this literally just released

jailbreak,not_removed,downgrade itunes then
jailbreak,not_removed,is it really that easy
jailbreak,not_removed,im not sure why you would need to downgrade itunes but it definitely is a driver issue that needs to be reinstalled through itunes either by reinstalling the current version updating itunes or downgrading itunes
jailbreak,not_removed,i mean for your issue with compatibility yes
jailbreak,not_removed,there is also a telegram one if interested
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,that post doesnt link to a discord server anywhere seems nothing became of it
jailbreak,not_removed,im already in the telegram chat but i use discord way more
jailbreak,not_removed,what iphons

jailbreak,not_removed,lockglyphx not lockglyph repo httpsticktrongithubcomrepo
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you i thought i had heard of that but i wasnt sure of the repo i presume this is compatible with ios now
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah info is on the package page in cydia
jailbreak,not_removed,does it require java script cuz that could be the problem
jailbreak,not_removed,thats strange couldve sworn ive gotten it to work on safari on my ipad a while back 🤔 maybe im misremembering
jailbreak,not_removed,youtube plus plus
jailbreak,not_removed,cercube or youtube put the plus sign together

jailbreak,not_removed,piracy is outlawed however what if its a kid with no bank details to purchase things just wondering piracy is outlawed however what if its a kid with no bank details to purchase things
jailbreak,not_removed,but thats still piracy imagine you go out to dinner eat whatever food you ordered and when its time to get the bill you tell the waiter you cant pay because youre a kid with no bank details to purchase things see what they tell you
jailbreak,not_removed,lol good point i probably wont give that a try haha but still though i was just wondering how itd be viewed
jailbreak,not_removed,wrong sub but no there isnt not since dont believe any links or youtube videos that tell you there are theyre all fakes edit wololo page has
jailbreak,not_removed,wrong type of jailbreak lol
jailbreak,not_removed,watchos works only with ios api there is no workaround
jailbreak,not_removed,i second this
jailbreak,not_removed,u a lame
jailbreak,not_removed,may i ask why setupapp is just the launch when u freshly restore a device
jailbreak,not_removed,restore the phone lol jk idk
jailbreak,not_removed,smash it
jailbreak,not_removed,download run it connect iphone look for deactivate button on extras or extras even more your device will be deactivated and it will run setupapp but be sure that you have no problems to activate device forget icloud password or smth like that
jailbreak,not_removed,sometimes theres a bug that happens on my device and all apps in applications have an icon and i can launch them which includes the setupapp but idk how to do this bug i think it was by installing a tweak and while it says reloading to go back to the homescreen just saying this this in case someone already got that bug
jailbreak,not_removed,if you are unjailbroken you can also just insert a different sim card into your device and it will automatically launch and force you too run setupapp as welli have a few extra sim cards that i have in a drawer that ive used for this purpose before some old and no longer used others brand new that have never been before activated or are activated and have a small amount of prepaid credits loaded on them
jailbreak,not_removed,sweet good to know thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,just curiosity to be honest no other reason i figured out how to do it via terminal
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe to use the move to ios thing swear to god i have seen many users feeling too excited when they got their iphone so they skip all the setups as quickly as possible to use it only to realize a few days later that they have to reset everything to transfer the data from their old androids
jailbreak,not_removed,not op reasons that violate sub rules ic bp cant be mentioned but im sure there are others i cannot think of
jailbreak,not_removed,it worked thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,howd ya do it
jailbreak,not_removed,launching setupapp would do nothing for an icloud locked device but lock it back
jailbreak,not_removed,violates my ass he asked a question and you icloud bypassmisery bastards
jailbreak,not_removed,i got a laugh out of it so he contributed more than you
jailbreak,not_removed,do you know a way to do it if not then dont worry about what i said at least restoring the phone is an option
jailbreak,not_removed,su open comapplepurplebuddy requires open from bigboss
jailbreak,not_removed,ik but to have the app running to see the processes linked on a non locked device for the use of finding exploits in the app
jailbreak,not_removed,violates my ass
jailbreak,not_removed,seconded i laughed
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,i installed open however terminal doesnt recognize the command what should i do
jailbreak,not_removed,if op had to ask how to launch it im assuming that they dont have the technical know how to exploit it
jailbreak,not_removed,thirded came back to reply to seconded then laughed again
jailbreak,not_removed,type su login as root then the rest of the command
jailbreak,not_removed,but you are op
jailbreak,not_removed,this is what im getting
jailbreak,not_removed,or am i
jailbreak,not_removed,are they actually op i cant trust you based on your username
jailbreak,not_removed,dont type su on the second part
jailbreak,not_removed,that work thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,no need for hacks just practice
jailbreak,not_removed,i think the whole reason why i posted this is because i didnt want to practice i like working smarter not harder
jailbreak,not_removed,and now it gets confusing if others reply because you didnt click reply you are commenting on your own question not replying to uthelatexduck
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry im new to reddit thanks for the help
jailbreak,not_removed,have you tried messaging the developer of the tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,no answer
jailbreak,not_removed,well you wont really find anything here
jailbreak,not_removed,if you deleted it using ifile check in the trash varmobilelibraryifiletrash
jailbreak,not_removed,cleared the trash out and cant even get past the lockscreen
jailbreak,not_removed,ouch thats pretty dumb not to be mean or anything but i never clear the trash after deleting system files especially something small like that if u only diddnt delete it you could possibly get into it with ifunbox and place it back
jailbreak,not_removed,he didnt mean to delete the trash he meant for you to replace the btserver file back to its original place
jailbreak,not_removed,i meant through ssh but if you already cleared the trash you may be out of luck if you had make a copy ofbacked up the file before deleting it it would have been an easy fix
jailbreak,not_removed,he understands that he was saying he had already emptied the trash before the person had said to check the trash
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah and thats exactly why i asked if anyone had a version of the file i could use trying to boot into safe boot by holding the volume up takes me to a blue screen and just doesnt work
jailbreak,not_removed,pretty sure distributing copyrighted files is against site rules if your device had been a bit iphone you could have decrypted the ipsw and copied the file you needed unfortunately the is bit and there are no firmware keys for any version of ios
jailbreak,not_removed,you can get it from a full ota update httpnewosxbookcomarticlesotahtml
jailbreak,not_removed,u cant use pirated repos
jailbreak,not_removed,its not that happens even if i try to upgrade free tweaks like phantom lite and so on
jailbreak,not_removed,try substrate fix or turn off phone and use yalu to rejailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,happened to me days ago
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont see a bug but you should stop listening to ballin ive never heard a worst hook in my life edit i see the bug now sorry i dont know how to help but fr that song was trash
jailbreak,not_removed,all you did was click the upnext key lmao theres no bug there
jailbreak,not_removed,it still has the music controls there
jailbreak,not_removed,even the android users have this why dont we facebook is an app yes im referring specifically to the app that a great portion of the people use and even more during the night
jailbreak,not_removed,yes please cant see that blue white anymore
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt eclipse do this
jailbreak,not_removed,latest version of both eclipse and messenger about a week after ios jailbreak was announced then i updated
jailbreak,not_removed,exactly
jailbreak,not_removed,no it doesnt change anything on the facebook app iirc it worked around ios days but not lately it does however work great with facebook messenger on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,it doesnt every time i tried to open a conversation the app crashes with eclipse active ios
jailbreak,not_removed,what messenger version are you on i had it working great without any special accommodations a while back it has probably been or months with all of their recent updates im sure it has broken the compatibility with eclipse but you could downgrade the app im sure
jailbreak,not_removed,they stop you from receiving and sending messages if youre not on a more recent version
jailbreak,not_removed,really well i know that this is only for really old versions because i have a friend still rocking one from a couple months ago or more
jailbreak,not_removed,my is using pangu english and have virtually no battery drain if springboard is the problem it might be a springboard tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,are you using that drains battery
jailbreak,not_removed,i have alot of tweaks all of them compatible with if it isnt compatible i dont install it i say i have maybe tweaks including themes and custom ls
jailbreak,not_removed,youre using an old phone their batteries go to shit over time

jailbreak,not_removed,dissident drains battery
jailbreak,not_removed,i installed dissident and had to uninstall shortly after because it was draining more battery than saving
jailbreak,not_removed,very possible because that tweak is capable of having them run in the background i know you said you set it to fast freeze so im not exactly sure if it was monitor your battery usage over the next couple hours to see if uninstalling it helped
jailbreak,not_removed,nice glad to hear that man
jailbreak,not_removed,probably one of your tweaks is pirated remove it and buy it or do without edit also bytafont is extremely buggy these days as it stole code from anemone i would recommend removing it and using only anemone

jailbreak,not_removed,just got mine replaced today it was on ios iphone matte black
jailbreak,not_removed,im really confused how does a non moving part just break
jailbreak,not_removed,yas
jailbreak,not_removed,entire taptic engine failed
jailbreak,not_removed,just now hit me that apple replaced a moving part the home button with another moving part taptic engine they made no progress idle overengineering at its finest
jailbreak,not_removed,excellent
jailbreak,not_removed,you tell me lol
jailbreak,not_removed,free my g 🙌🏿
jailbreak,not_removed,well to be fair last gen had both so they slimmed down i guess
jailbreak,not_removed,name 😂
jailbreak,not_removed,i have to ask why would you want to disable that i thought its to protect in case some one takes the device you can wipe whats on it
jailbreak,not_removed,i am in an icloud family account and i dont like the possibility of a family member erasing it
jailbreak,not_removed,my first guess was that maybe after reading some peoples stories about getting their devices wiped trying to download pg client app from another account you wanted to protect yourself
jailbreak,not_removed,ah i see i dont use icloud so id have really no knowledge of the family account a tweak like that would be interesting if one can be done
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah had this happen last night wasnt much fun
jailbreak,not_removed,username checks out
jailbreak,not_removed,remindme hours
jailbreak,not_removed,no virus rest assure what is the error cydia gives you when you try to download tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,give us a tweak list and then try no substrate mode see if that works you do that by holding the volume up the button when your phone is starting up try that and tell me if it works
jailbreak,not_removed,lol
jailbreak,not_removed,op stated already that its fine on safe mode so its definitely one of hisher tweaks so nsm is not needed here they work in similar fashion

jailbreak,not_removed,stop suggesting this what youre doing is burning a forest just to get rid of a squirrel
jailbreak,not_removed,that would require accessing files that apps on unjailbroken devices cant reach to change that would require changing system files which only apple or someone who found a vulnerability in ios can do
jailbreak,not_removed,nah it might be able to track but not able to take a picture
jailbreak,not_removed,great dev great tweak doesnt have gps location because its dependencies arent updated yet
jailbreak,not_removed,yes its called dont lose you phone and pay attention 😂
jailbreak,not_removed,you need a jailbreak for that
jailbreak,not_removed,oh i just quick glanced over the title seems weird he would ask for a non jailbroken item in a jailbreak sub however the answer to hisquestion is there arent any apps that have the ability to do this without the app being open so hes just lost
jailbreak,not_removed,gonna need a bit more detail than that
jailbreak,not_removed,it worked the first few days and im not sure what happened but same thing here just some file wants to download
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,posted at the same time as you
jailbreak,not_removed,omg thats hilarious but im so happy
jailbreak,not_removed,photoshop
jailbreak,not_removed,the problem with these backup apps is that they hold very little value the main scenario when they are needed is when a new jailbreak is released cricket and you want to backup all your tweaks then jailbreak a new phone or whatever and easily restore all the tweaks at once i would love it to work out this way but truth is it doesnt when a new jailbreak releases most tweaks wont work and are not updated so what happens is you restore all these broken tweaks and they can literally plague your phone full of issues not worth it imo and then there is that price point no thanks what i do now is simply make a list of all my tweaks with something like appinfo or the like i save the file and whenever a new jailbreak is out i just check the compatibility spreadsheet to see what i can put on the phone at the time
jailbreak,not_removed,jesus for something you use rarely ok
jailbreak,not_removed,whats new crash at startup love this new feature s is reasonable given the amount of time it would save on setting things back up my only hesitation is past versions didnt leave out things like untethers potentially screwing everything up and forcing a restore
jailbreak,not_removed,bs this has been horribly inconsistent since ios or so i have sent him multiple emails and tweets every release it seems and get no reply i finally got short with him on twitter to which he said something to the effect of stop being a baby blasting me on twitter send a support email well i replied to that tweet with my screenshots showing i had sent him emails and hours before with no response guess what he never replied to the tweets or emails the app sucks it worked when it truly was kiss it has sucked horribly since ios or so he is an ahat as well
jailbreak,not_removed,why so cheap
jailbreak,not_removed,wondering if the new version is working for most of you it crashes on my ipad and i cant get the dev to respond anyone else have luck contacting him otherwise looks like this expensive app goes in the bin
jailbreak,not_removed,this never worked for me i ended up manually repackaging all debs and saving them to dropbox
jailbreak,not_removed,have and love this app question can i import my backup from a to a found a jbroken and want to switch
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work for me on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,i bought this a few years back and i am not happy with it at all it would not back up to google drive only dropbox rarely did it work and when i really needed it on my i tried to restore from a older backup to fix some issues i got from a bad tweak it didnt fix anything pissed and on now
jailbreak,not_removed,i have this tweak and when i try to restore from a back up something goes wrong so i have to manually install each tweak honestly id rather just install each tweak again so i can have fresh tweaks lol
jailbreak,not_removed,description this is a kisskeep it simple stupid ios application that backuprestore all cydia packages in additions to preferences amp springboard files it also support categories amp hidden files furthermore you can now autobackup amp schedule a backup pkgbackup is now cloudaware now you have the choice of storingrestoring your backup on the device addressbook or local storage or on the cloud box dropbox ftp gdrive skydrive sugarsync which is recommended for large backup and for backup versioning if you can tap you can use this app its so simple a caveman can do it you can also share your packages lists to others via facebook twitter messages amp mail printing amp copying in your clipboard your data is also available im counting on your support amp comments to make this app more kissable if you are using a crackedhacked version amp like the app please do buy the official version to support my effort amp the jailbroken developer community please do so please enable respring after installupdate changelog crash at startup moved app settings within the app
jailbreak,not_removed,its expensive but worth it its not one of those apps you buy and it stops being supported a year later ive had this since ios
jailbreak,not_removed,i was about to write a similar comment
jailbreak,not_removed,it has the ability to check firmware compatibility before it restores individual tweaksif you turn on the option to do soshit just upgraded it on crashes on start upfinally ran on try
jailbreak,not_removed,i just wish we had more options to help out in this cydia saves your repos now i believe so thats awesome if it could save a list of everything installed and only let you reinstall when the package is marked as compatible that would be great too the way it does paid packages now by tying them to your account but for that to happen you have to create and enforce rules but for some reason this issue is looked at as impossible when even small things like saving a list can help out a lot and save a lot of time taking screenshots of your installed packages and using excel sheets to check compatibility is annoying and kind of ridiculous we have to do this just saying
jailbreak,not_removed,i bought it back in ios or jibril makes sure its always updated and gives good support via email
jailbreak,not_removed,great app and great developer always responds to support emails updates the app etc
jailbreak,not_removed,i changed whats new to changelog
jailbreak,not_removed,my attempts to get support are similar every brief response from him if you even get one ends with let me know you let him know but never hear anything back ive gotten much better support from developers who make •free• tweaks and apps
jailbreak,not_removed,i feel like youre being facetious but isnt that much money
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work on either latest version opens to black screen then crashes should have never updated as this happens frequently with this app its working you update it stops working you write him he makes a suggestion that doesnt work you write him back and you never hear from him again
jailbreak,not_removed,double click the home buttoneven though it crashes it still shows thereclose and try againsometimes it require or restarts for methen miraculously it runs perfect
jailbreak,not_removed,i never saw the utility of those backup tweaks no doubt its well done but such utilities are mostly used only when a new jailbreak comes out or when swapping for a new device since many tweaks cannot be restored to a higher firmware or sometimes to a different device you just cant restore the full backup
jailbreak,not_removed,it crashes at startup since the two last updates please fix it i need to make backup im on ios iphone ive tried uninstallingreinstalling cleaning with icleaner nothing helps
jailbreak,not_removed,oh no doubt im not knocking that im just saying for example instagram or facebook which are used all the time vs used once every so often i dont install many cydia packages in a day to warrant a tweak that backs up to a cloud i literally install a tweak every month if that
jailbreak,not_removed,bs this has been horribly inconsistent since ios or so i have sent him multiple emails and tweets every release it seems and get no reply i finally got short with him on twitter to which he said something to the effect of stop being a baby blasting me on twitter send a support email well i replied to that tweet with my screenshots showing i had sent him emails and hours before with no response guess what he never replied to the tweets or emails the app sucks it worked when it truly was kiss it has sucked horribly since ios or so he is an ahat as well
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry i was just joking but thank for clearing it up
jailbreak,not_removed,its all relative
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe where you live it is not here in my country its expensive there is no fucking way i would buy it
jailbreak,not_removed,i tried your scheme but no go it simply opens to a black screen and eventually crashes i can sometime go back to springboard and sometimes get the black screen to appear in app switcher but it never runs ive removed reinstalled etc but no go and the dev will not write back
jailbreak,not_removed,its for when you want to restore or update backup your tweaks sources and preference files then restore after you wipe your device its very useful if you restore or develop a lot
jailbreak,not_removed,my attempts to get support are similar every brief response from him if you even get one ends with let me know you let him know but never hear anything back ive gotten much better support from developers who make •free• tweaks and apps
jailbreak,not_removed,isnt this virtually useless since there isnt a jailbreak out
jailbreak,not_removed,yup totally agree app used to be damn near perfect he decided to do a bunch of crap to it that wasnt necessary and its just a bloated pos now that most of the time cant even do its primary function
jailbreak,not_removed,not at all you can still semirestore your phone
jailbreak,not_removed,worse he calls it kiss which ive always considered condescending especially since the app is anything but simple to operate it may not be all that difficult but it has so many options to set that one cannot just press and play as he advertises finally his app naming conventions versus how he names his changelog are awful if you look for versions that work with ios for example theyre under a different category the whole thing is just a mess and the most expensive jailbreak app i ever bought by more than double the new version is broken on my ipad air and still no word back from him arrrrgh
jailbreak,not_removed,been having issues as well im playing and it works great if i leave the game and go back in its done and doesnt work anymore same with snes emulator
jailbreak,not_removed,how to enter no substrate mode on ios reboot close all apps in the switcher open pppangu wait seconds tap circlestart wait seconds hold the volume up button from this point on click your sleep button youll know if youre in no substrate mode after the boot up because cydia will be able to open none of your other tweaks will work though
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont think the wait sec both times and close all apps is necessary since all apps are closed when you boot and i entered no substrate mode by just going on the app pushing the circle and holding vol up right when you push the lock button
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks tried this about times still cant open cydia not sure what im doing wrong but just cant get into no substrate
jailbreak,not_removed,its just helpful because the tweak conflict can make the pangu program harder to run
jailbreak,not_removed,thats annoying did you have cydia substrate installed
jailbreak,not_removed,i was saying doesnt the jailbreak close all apps when it resprings
jailbreak,not_removed,a respring does close all apps yes
jailbreak,not_removed,forgot to mention i never experienced this before jailbreaking and want to know how can fix this without the risk of losing my jailbreak how else can i add music to my phone without the use of itunes thanks in advance
jailbreak,not_removed,pawntunes
jailbreak,not_removed,try toggling icloud music library i guess
jailbreak,not_removed,try using a toothpick and try to clear the debris out of the socket things like lint and dust
jailbreak,not_removed,typically theyll restore it to current ios if they dont just replace the phone outright
jailbreak,not_removed,if you take it to apple theyll try plugging it into one of their cables then theyll try cleaning the port then theyll restore it to the latest ios before attempting any hardware repair
jailbreak,not_removed,depends who looks at it and they could just send you a replacement which means you would lose your jailbreak anyway
jailbreak,not_removed,have you tried more than one lightning cable
jailbreak,not_removed,they shouldnt because like you said its hardware not software but dont be surprised if they do and they may ask you to restore it it really depends on who gets a hold of your phone also and how lax they are with the rules if they dont want it restored i would hide whatever you can and remove cydia from the spotlight search even though if they really wanted to check they could and they have diagnostic tools that is depending on if they ask you to or restore the device themselves
jailbreak,not_removed,easy to do yourself may be able to find the parts cheaper somewhere else as well like ebay or amazon ifixit just has a good step by step walkthrough of the repair process
jailbreak,not_removed,too bad op didnt let us know how it went always get excited about the broken charging ports just being a shit ton of lint and dust clogged in it
jailbreak,not_removed,its always dirt i work at verizon ive had literally non working port all the billion other ones were dirty
jailbreak,not_removed,this repaired several phones this way little pieces of junk will be compressed in the ceiling of the lightning port this prevents the plug from sliding all the way in and you are confronted with disconnects break up a toothpick and use the splintered wood to brush out the port
jailbreak,not_removed,agree with these two other posts my work colleague told me he had to position his phone at a very specific angle to get it to charge and had been doing this for months to a pin and managed to remove a very significant piece of fluff from the port i couldnt believe how tightly it was packed in there and instantly the phone charged perfectly
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah id definitely try cleaning it out first as others suggested
jailbreak,not_removed,dang that sucks
jailbreak,not_removed,who actually buys the insurance thats the biggest scam out there factory warranty will fix most issues and a good case only costs as much as a month or two of the insurance would i mean not to call you out on it but please can someone really tell me why anyone should buy the insurance other than not caring about wasting more money most issues even hardware are easily fixed cheaper than any repair shop will charge as well i suppose thats why theres such a big market for these places now days i always fix my own electronics when possible
jailbreak,not_removed,ha awesome
jailbreak,not_removed,ios is pretty dope to be honest youll definitely notice a massive improvement in speed over ios keep in mind that unless your phone magically came with blobs you will only be able to downgrade to ios tethered meaning youll have to connect the phone to a computer whenever you need to turn it on
jailbreak,not_removed,as a user of an iphone as my daily driver for months while waiting on upgrading to a se ios without a doubt much more reliable faster and just better far more polished
jailbreak,not_removed,ios perks over speed beautiful skeumorphic design its not a little faster its much faster try watching youtube videos of ios on the iphone to see the difference even with ios its even better ios perks over much more tweaks support like control center a little more app support untethered jailbreak assuming your using the tethered downgrade method it really depends on what your looking for and how you use your phone if you want it to perform well as your daily driver then but if you need compatibility for certain things then go for i personally would go for because of equalizereverywhere and other control center tweaks or if you really want speed go to
jailbreak,not_removed,how much was the iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,so but youre wrong about the blobs lol no blobs are needed edit read the comment wrong lmao sorry
jailbreak,not_removed,you can buy them all day long in croatia for
jailbreak,not_removed,blobs are kinda needed if you want the downgrade untethered if youre okay with it being tethered then you dont need blobs
jailbreak,not_removed,oh goodness send me the link please
jailbreak,not_removed,im okay with a tethered downgrade i dont have blobs althoughis there a way to actually get blobs at the moment ifaith or something
jailbreak,not_removed,i got a gsm unlocked iphone for
jailbreak,not_removed,you dont need blobs just go to enjoy
jailbreak,not_removed,a real problem with that method is that you lose the voicemail feature altogether when your phone is off unreachable for whatever reasons or if you are already on call
jailbreak,not_removed,just a warning i bought iblacklist to block calls from blocked numbers which stock ios wont let you do the tweak never worked for me and after several emails and tweets with zero response from the devs i filed a dispute with paypal and got my money back screw them is the best call blocking tweak imo and its only
jailbreak,not_removed,i agree with the problem about the phone being off voice machine i believe captures voicemails even when you are on a call i dont really ever turn off my phone if anything its on do not disturb all i know is that today is the first day i will not get any spam calls and or voicemails
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackagecomzestlabssentinel bigboss tweaks extend the call blocking features of ios praise grate god™ type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,it worked for me but yea they are lousy at communication i cant remember though if sentinel sends blocked calls to voicemail if it does then i would advise sentinel because its cheaper and there devs respond
jailbreak,not_removed,is your problem the spam calls or the voicemails after installing sentinel i get maybe of the spam calls i used to and even though i still get voicemails from some of them i never get a notification and i just delete them periodically the notification thing is huge because even though ios doesnt give notifications for voicemails left by blocked numbers i would still get a notification on my pebble since i started using sentinel that doesnt happen anymore
jailbreak,not_removed,its both in all honestly i forgot about sentinel actually im sure doing as i stated above with sentinel would work as well well heres the thing with blocking the original voicemail feature and setting i blacklist to send it to voicemail that is not set up so they cant leave a voicemail and i do not get bothered with there calls even with sentinel you will still have voicemails so now i dont get any notifications or voicemails but i can still see who called in my recent calls list plus i do not have to keep adding numbers to a blocked list in order to not get notifications just wanted a way for only important calls to come through
jailbreak,not_removed,sentinel does allow calls to go to voicemail but theres no notifications however it keeps the blocked calls out of my recent calls and keeps track in the sentinel app itself i am however intrigued about how you dont add new numbers to a blocked list the way ive been handling new numbers that call me is i copy the number and open the truecaller app which then prompts me to search for that number if its found to be spam i add it in the truecaller app which then adds the number to a contact in my phone it maintains called spam i also update the truecaller lost from the app periodically so it catches most of the new spam numbers ive gone from about robocalls a day to maybe every three or four days tops and i dont get anymore notifications about any number thats been blocked
jailbreak,not_removed,ok so basically i have it only set to allow contacts to call me iblacklist if you think about it youll add way more spam numbers than adding numbers to your contacts or another white list so why dont you just add to white lists instead of adding numbers to a spam list also i dont want spam numbers in my phonebook
jailbreak,not_removed,i have to allow numbers i dont know i often get calls from my kids daycare on different extensions that i dont have saved theyre up to seven different numbers so far doctors offices and other such places i have to be able to answer as well sometimes i get calls from clients from work whose numbers i havent gotten as well theres about four or five area codes ill answer from if i get a call all the rest i let go to voicemail then i check those its worth the very little effort it takes the change in received calls from before to after i installed sentinel is just astounding as far as having spam numbers in my phone book theyre all under one contact theres about numbers in that one contact right now now when i look at the blocked call log in sentinel when i see spam i know its a number identified by truecaller
jailbreak,not_removed,hey as long as your comfortable and ok with the results thats great i get like spam calls a day so for me this was worth it
jailbreak,not_removed,yup if it works it works i was getting a day and now i get every three to four days its awesome im glad your system works too
jailbreak,not_removed,please see to fix your issue
jailbreak,not_removed,hoo boy youre probably better off restoring again and using cydiaimpactor on your pc with the english app it has an embedded certificate that will let you keep it for a year
jailbreak,not_removed,im not sure if it requires ms but you could always try cydiaeraser to remove the jb the rejailbreak through cydiaimpactor
jailbreak,not_removed,well what errors does cydia spew when attempting to install something
jailbreak,not_removed,can you postpm your packages list there might be something weird installed
jailbreak,not_removed,could you check the files on ppchinese scroll to the bottom in info view for it edit considering that i dont have this package installed its a little suspicious
jailbreak,not_removed,what did you use to rejailbreak the pg client app or one of the other methodsedit and i meant the file system content bit ie
jailbreak,not_removed,mm i used nvwastone might be just that its the chinese version installing its extra fonts could you get me a full list of your installed packages pm me the output of dpkg list in ssh or mterm
jailbreak,not_removed,all you do is tap snapchat its a feature of the app no tweak needed
jailbreak,not_removed,wow til
jailbreak,not_removed,what do the numbers mean is it how many youve sent how many youve received
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks til
jailbreak,not_removed,i believe so
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,using a problem called if
jailbreak,not_removed,app store free productivity can be used to set alerts for the next jailbreak so youll know as soon as its released
jailbreak,not_removed,whats the recipie for it
jailbreak,not_removed,i thought youre a bot for a moment
jailbreak,not_removed,you can make it as your own or find one
jailbreak,not_removed,i had the same problem until i switched to the english version never had a failed jailbreak since
jailbreak,not_removed,i had the same problem until i realised that once you press on the chinese writing in the middle of the circle on the pp app wait for like seconds until you lock your device i also do not get a notification but it will rejailbreak fine for me
jailbreak,not_removed,do u think i should rejailbreak with the english ver
jailbreak,not_removed,rejailbreak following this
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont mind rejailbreak reinstalling the app every days it just fixed it for me
jailbreak,not_removed,i tried it and it didnt work even restored my phone to a backup but still doesnt work
jailbreak,not_removed,dont know if it still works but try it removes the separators system wide repo
jailbreak,not_removed,i think its a setting in
jailbreak,not_removed,you could use my to accomplish that i have confirmed that it does work on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,ive been wondering the same thing
jailbreak,not_removed,the a flex tweak in settings sectionhide separators or something that
jailbreak,not_removed,flex patch combine section
jailbreak,not_removed,if you use flex try the following patch
jailbreak,not_removed,uantiquedev is this something you could cook together sorry for always pointing you out but you make things happen pretty fast too ✌🏽
jailbreak,not_removed,unfortunately it didnt work
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackagecomcpdigitaldarkroomhidemex bigboss tweaks the ultimate ios customizing experience hi mom type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i also reply to pms i currently only work with default repos please do not reply to this comment the person who requested me will not see your reply httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot httpswwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobotwikieditingcomments
jailbreak,not_removed,if you think of table separators then its not what im asking for how can i merge all of the columns in settings together please look at the picture i want to get rid of the gaps not the seperators the circled red ones 😉
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks but i dont dare to screw around with system files like that very afraid to f up things 🤓 was hoping there was a teeak for this by the way why dont you suggest someone to make it a tweak with your help like editing the settingscells position in a tweak etc
jailbreak,not_removed,can only find for table seperators which hidemex have already but not for the gaps
jailbreak,not_removed,its was definatelly better but theres still some gaps httpiimgurcomhdsxnmhpng
jailbreak,not_removed,system widesystem uihide table separators i dont know if it works but let me know if it does
jailbreak,not_removed,oh sorry i dont know how to do that
jailbreak,not_removed,just did it as long as you just copy the whole folder somewhere safe you dont risk fucking up much
jailbreak,not_removed,combine sections flex tweak for you man 😉
jailbreak,not_removed,oh i see i made this back on ios so apple changed a few things with ios anyway i just made a new one for you that works with ios
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for throwing in a suggestion at least 🙌🏽
jailbreak,not_removed,im not sure if you get me but i have pretty control on what im installing of tweaks etc through cydia and flex but i honestly dont dare to edit some systemfiles manually like your tutorial does very grateful for your solution 🙌🏽 but was hoping for a tweak for it for example hidemex where i can edit things easily without doing stuff manually with the system files
jailbreak,not_removed,its was definatelly better but theres still some gaps httpiimgurcomhdsxnmhpng
jailbreak,not_removed,holy moly you really made my day thank you so much 🙌🏽
jailbreak,not_removed,i get you just told you that its not that big a deal is all
jailbreak,not_removed,look at this and ask him
jailbreak,not_removed,youre welcome
jailbreak,not_removed,ucomex i am also curious as i wish to jb some of my older model idevices
jailbreak,not_removed,try or i think you cas still check iclarifiedcom for more info and select ipsw file it will stuck in boot with error or im not sure now ouse tinyumberlla to kick out recovery mode anydoubt pm
jailbreak,not_removed,use spirit
jailbreak,not_removed,httpscanijailbreakcom try visiting httpsjailbreakmeqoidusstar in safari it is jailbreakable using the classic jailbreakme google next timeread sidebar
jailbreak,not_removed,lol yeah i know about the error i just gotta use a program to kick it out of recovery also good news last night i managed to jailbreak it with still having some problems with cydia but hey it worked
jailbreak,not_removed,theres no download links for it sadly
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry forgot it was there oh and i tried going on the jailbreakme website and when i slide to upgrade nothing happened
jailbreak,not_removed,here i zipped it up and uploaded it for you youre right though httpspiritjbcom is dead
jailbreak,not_removed,slide to jailbreak i mean
jailbreak,not_removed,perhaps redsnow
jailbreak,not_removed,ucomex i see you moved jailbreakme i just tried it on a iphone and it doesnt work any plans to fix it
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks so much man
jailbreak,not_removed,tried that also im getting stuck on waiting for reboot
jailbreak,not_removed,i second that some people still wanna use it ucomex
jailbreak,not_removed,jailbreakmecom httpsjailbreakmeqoidus is dead for the time being try using some alternate host although check its trust first they sometimes bundle malware or do it yourself httpsgithubcomcomexstar i seconded this twice once on rlegacyjailbreak and once here if neither is an option the use for your error try a newer version or
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry this is my fault so many things on my todo list
jailbreak,not_removed,its ok youve always been busy
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for chiming in i hope your life endeavors are treating you well
jailbreak,not_removed,oh hi comex this is the first time im seeing you there
jailbreak,not_removed,hey ucomex do you know of any alternative hosts i really want to use jailbreakme is a pain
jailbreak,not_removed,why not just download the tweak for the youtube app
jailbreak,not_removed,try using appcon to theme the app
jailbreak,not_removed,alright good to hear although i gotta say appcon is most likely easier to use
jailbreak,not_removed,this could work but how much money would all this special equipment gonna cost me where will i learn how to safely remove my iphones nand chip without causing damage
jailbreak,not_removed,anythings possible if you try hard enough and believe in yourself good luck not destroying the device though thats tricky stuff
jailbreak,not_removed,this will works but you need to reflow it to pull the nand chip it is not like there are test point where you can interact to the chip directly like amazon fire tv
jailbreak,not_removed,probably though you wont easily find a nand reader that would allow you to save and reflash iphone nand
jailbreak,not_removed,might be viable for jb teams though
jailbreak,not_removed,probably pretty expensive and the disassembly actually shouldnt be too difficult id be willing to test this on some phones if i had the money for a nand reader
jailbreak,not_removed,well it obviously worked for you if you have an iphone on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,could you further explain this please im not too familiar with nand
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah if they need to fix bugs they could just reflash an old os
jailbreak,not_removed,haha somewhere i saw some chinese people who would copy an oem nand from an iphone get an aftermarket nand chip replace the data on the new one and re install the chip to upgrade the storage
jailbreak,not_removed,the nand chip is in the iphone you have to open up the iphone to interactaccess it and you probably also need to dis solder the chip from the logic board which is dangerous since youre heating up the components of the iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,thats amazing did ios register the new free data correctly
jailbreak,not_removed,i didnt know you would have to dis solder it i thought you could just unplug it from the logic board that would be very challenging
jailbreak,not_removed,i believe so ill look for the video and report back
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,theres the video
jailbreak,not_removed,wow thats awesome
jailbreak,not_removed,did you notice at the end he restored ios apparently he cant just do a raw copy otherwise there would be no need to restore
jailbreak,not_removed,i will always appreciate the gift you gave me thank you ziphon you were the first person to ever gift me a cydia tweak ☺️
jailbreak,not_removed,today we lost a good man
jailbreak,not_removed,seems you have joined the dark side tm
jailbreak,not_removed,hello its now official im now an android developer d i developed a tweak some weeks ago to play to an instrument while typing on the ios keyboard this tweak is called i ported as the ios version you can play to instruments bass drums guitar piano and violin only the qwerty and azerty keyboard are included for the moment note yes im now an android developer but as i said in my previous post ill still work on my tweaks ill not do new big tweaks anymore though
jailbreak,not_removed,hey you might wanna hit randroid and randroidapps to promote it really good to see you go into android as well d
jailbreak,not_removed,jaikbreak relevancy
jailbreak,not_removed,bravo à toi mec
jailbreak,not_removed,could you make it for the app store or is apple development lisecense too expensive
jailbreak,not_removed,nice i already fall in love to my simple google keyboard but this is a nice addition to android keyboard collection especially for the ones who likes musical instruments great work and i hope the best for the future success on your android development ps i really miss snapper on my iphone anyone care to port it to android i also miss activator there are no snapper alternative that i knew on android
jailbreak,not_removed,store page could really use a video
jailbreak,not_removed,id like the option to try this before i buy it every app ive paid for has a free stripped down trial ad supported version apps ive never purchased ones i cant try beforehand
jailbreak,not_removed,i had a hell of a time finding it i had to enter in the search box that shows all of your apps
jailbreak,not_removed,im really curious how will sales compare between jb and android it would make sense to be better on andro but its hard to break through with your app and get noticed i for one added one point for jb team p
jailbreak,not_removed,tu vas nous manquer mais tu reste quand même modérateur de ce subreddit
jailbreak,not_removed,this is awesome welcome to the big leagues
jailbreak,not_removed,and i remember this moment as if it were yesterday 😊 youre welcome 😄
jailbreak,not_removed,its now official im now an android developer d traitor p
jailbreak,not_removed,so its safe to assume you wont do anymore and good job with the transition to android
jailbreak,not_removed,can you port some of your tweaks to android d
jailbreak,not_removed,good idea
jailbreak,not_removed,merci 😊
jailbreak,not_removed,i probably will when i can afford it
jailbreak,not_removed,i think ill do a free version
jailbreak,not_removed,cant you return apps on play
jailbreak,not_removed,bien sûr
jailbreak,not_removed,weather timeline
jailbreak,not_removed,im sure there are already a ton of weather apps
jailbreak,not_removed,idk why but for some reason this just sounds so suggestive in my head
jailbreak,not_removed,nah p
jailbreak,not_removed,i almost finished this tweak i will give the source code of vertical to a designer of this concept he will do what he wants with it
jailbreak,not_removed,do it android needs good developers there are so many crappy developers there i just got this and i added a review maybe eventually you can find a way to play back typed phrases as it is now the keyboard plays random notes or drum parts when you press the keys i dont know if assigning each key to a note or specific drum part like kick drum snare high hat etc would be better but we could make a little songs if we could do that
jailbreak,not_removed,as long as you dont add the ads that cover the whole thing i hate those the developer of started doing that so that every time you switch to a different area of the app it would show a full screen that you cant back out of eventually i got lucky patcher and patched the crap out of the google ads so now only a little red box shows i dont mind a little banner underneath or above somewhere unobstrusive but many android apps are strewn with fullpage ads that you cant click out of one of them completely bricked one of my androids it couldnt be closed it wrecked the entire operating system so i had to flash the device ios apps had been relatively free of this kind of malicious advertising until angry birds came out i installed that and deleted it within one minute i dont know how much control a droid developer has over how the ads are shown though you might not have it a choice
jailbreak,not_removed,yes 😄 paging since he made the concept hopefully another dev can finish it up
jailbreak,not_removed,why did you decide to make the switch to android development over ios app development
jailbreak,not_removed,this is the same problem as the musicalkeyboard tweak this would be so long to do because theres a ton of languages and layouts qwerty azerty and weird keyboards
jailbreak,not_removed,the free version of musicalkeyboard if ill do one will not include ads its totally useless for a keyboard
jailbreak,not_removed,hey thats my mockup from a while ago i guess well need a new developer to take this on then 😉
jailbreak,not_removed,probably because it is loads easier
jailbreak,not_removed,ios app development is more expansive than android development ios every year android one time once i can afford it i will do ios apps as well
jailbreak,not_removed,oh yeah i forgot about that any language that uses a qwerty keyboard would be ok but all other languages would be a nightmare
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont know about that i was able to write you a good review on google play with it ha ha if you could include the google voice typing key that might help
jailbreak,not_removed,ill give you the source code of what ive done tomorrow
jailbreak,not_removed,im downi have a lot on my todo list but i can prioritize this
jailbreak,not_removed,ahah nice p
jailbreak,not_removed,yes thank you and if you need any beta testing i can help
jailbreak,not_removed,what devices do you have for testing
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone ios main iphone ios ipad mini ios
jailbreak,not_removed,perfect
jailbreak,not_removed,nonstop music theres a version for ios but ive heard its not always consistent
jailbreak,not_removed,i have this one and never have never had an issue yet crosses fingers
jailbreak,not_removed,youre using machportal
jailbreak,not_removed,update your flair since it helps people who help you
jailbreak,not_removed,ok i hope my flair will be helpful to people attempting to help me
jailbreak,not_removed,use yalu
jailbreak,not_removed,no thats yalumachportal
jailbreak,not_removed,httpsyaluqwertyoruiopcom
jailbreak,not_removed,wait are you on or
jailbreak,not_removed,same website just look near the top of the page not way at the bottom
jailbreak,not_removed,if you are on the iphone use machportal if you are on the iphone iphone or iphone use supports all devices excluding and works on ios only use machportal for it only works on
jailbreak,not_removed,no its the one that says ipa
jailbreak,not_removed,then use the tool download where it says beta and sign with impactor should work
jailbreak,not_removed,by life do you mean battery life or just life in general floater is a cool one for rounded edges in apps keyboard home screen etc give some more detail on what youre after
jailbreak,not_removed,just life in general for reference im using an ipad air
jailbreak,not_removed,hmm well it depends what you like noslowanimations is useful alkaline customises the battery icon zeppelin and bars are nice if its a celluar ipad i absolutely love flipcontrolcentre for themes try anemone and then download themes you like
jailbreak,not_removed,its a cellular pad but i dont use a sim with it id love to suppress the no sim message
jailbreak,not_removed,idk if this works but buy a sim from a grocery shop like coles they are and just dont put a plan on it idk if that would work but thats all i can think of sorry
jailbreak,not_removed,get the appstore app called adblock and never see another ad again it works great
jailbreak,not_removed,did you enable it mine even block adverts on television streaming apps unskippable ads on ios gameseverything
jailbreak,not_removed,splitify
jailbreak,not_removed,its only for landscape
jailbreak,not_removed,nope not on my at least
jailbreak,not_removed,same here
jailbreak,not_removed,use
jailbreak,not_removed,so i checked the compatibility for every installed tweak after deleting every tweak i only installed compatible tweaks and now it works fine you can check the compatibility
jailbreak,not_removed,where can beta be downloaded
jailbreak,not_removed,coolstars stashings
jailbreak,not_removed,stashing for ios from cool stars repo
jailbreak,not_removed,get coolstars stashing tweak version
jailbreak,not_removed,iirc it uses its own certificate to use https which is encrypted but it might still be vulnerable to sslstrip attacks
jailbreak,not_removed,unrelated to op question but still on the topic of remote messages does anyone know how to send a message using a keyboard shortcut rather than having to click send each time
jailbreak,not_removed,ok thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,is this a joke in the chance that im not running the joke no stereo speakers are new hardware in the pre devices simply dont have stereo speakers as much as phones dont have lightning ports
jailbreak,not_removed,can we get a tweak that will enable the hidden feature known as wireless charging whilst were at it please
jailbreak,not_removed,you could try unrestrictor not the best fix but it should work
jailbreak,not_removed,sure you have the correct stock setting mobile data on then below use mobile data for appstore on
jailbreak,not_removed,youre a genius not sure how i missed this but it was off for some reason thanks a lot
jailbreak,not_removed,no bro but you could side load certain tweaks even like snap if your not jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,no sorry ☹️ you can go to but no good news about it getting a jailbreak and is safer
jailbreak,not_removed,no
jailbreak,not_removed,too late

jailbreak,not_removed,keep trying it sometimes fails dont erase all content and settings and it just means that the exploit failed i think also the callendar invites have nothing to do with jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,the calendar invites are a new creative way of advertising for some reason if the device is plugged into a computer the jailbreak process doesnt work properly

jailbreak,not_removed,i got my warning on november never uninstalled snap and never got banned im on version
jailbreak,not_removed,i think they have stopped but i really think a bigger ban wave is on it way
jailbreak,not_removed,i am on version the latest and i am using it without a problem
jailbreak,not_removed,a friend of mine got banned yesterday
jailbreak,not_removed,i was banned a while ago then i reinstalled phantom and im not banned again using the latest version aswell
jailbreak,not_removed,nope source im banned as of yesterday
jailbreak,not_removed,what is this sorry i have been off the forums for a while i have been using snap since the jailbreak and have never had any problems why are some people getting banned and others not
jailbreak,not_removed,always stay on the lowest software you can because their may be a release for that one staying on the lower versions gives you the chance to update where as if that phone has ios already then you can no longer downgrade hope this helps
jailbreak,not_removed,i highly doubt ios will have a jb coming out for it especially with the recent update of ios
jailbreak,not_removed,have a read
jailbreak,not_removed,the iphone se launched with ios so if the one you get is running ios or you should probably update to ios and wait for the next jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,anything happensdo you remember when apple released ios but then pangu dropped ios untethered jailbreak out of nowhere and we again we waited for another months for ios jb
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont think it is that unlikely because some devices like the or the ipad didnt receive the update to ios so is the last ios version they will ever receive and if no jailbreak for comes out these devices will be stuck without a jailbreak forever if you already updated
jailbreak,not_removed,yes it happened once in the history of jailbreaking every other one was for thencurrent firmware i wouldnt expect another retrojb
jailbreak,not_removed,none of these are purchased i had these tweaks installed just hours ago an example tweak is cream or quickshufflerepeat

jailbreak,not_removed,copic apex ae eclipse tweaks theres always something apple misses or doesnt get quite right
jailbreak,not_removed,choice apple comes and makes a ui maybe its good maybe its bad maybe you like some aspects of it and your friend others but whatever it is thats what you use when you jailbreak you gain the choice you can do what you want and no one not even apple can change that to a certain extent this is about more than tweaks this is about ownership everyone loves netflix — myself included — but what it heralds is very scary you dont buy a movie when you use netflix you buy the right to watch that movie and its a small leap from moviesasaservice to phonesasaservice to carsandhomesasservice to something even worse livesasaservice which is why i will always jailbreak my phone even if apple provides me with all the perfect uis and all the perfect apps so that i will have ownership of something that is supposed to be mine
jailbreak,not_removed,minimal hosts blocker
jailbreak,not_removed,honestly for me its mostly about control having access to root able to do virtually anything along with rigorous customization for example besides the themes theres very very tiny things that i do not like in stock ios i like being able to change chat bubble colors i like being able to lock individual apps bioprotect i like being able to hide all albums except recently deleted and camera roll i also love being able to change the color of my nc or cc and having extra toggles i love activator triggers and i also like the action menu which allows me to essentially save my instagram tags without copy pasting them from notes every time i like the carrier displaying my username and i like using ncbrowser so i can pull down my notification center with my school timetable as the homepage allowing for easy access i find custom fonts to be a good touch as well as springy animations all those things are great but again it all comes down to making the phone mine i bought it i payed for it i should be allowed to do as i please with it within reason of course and that should definitely include being able to mess with system files even though i generally dont plus its a great conversation starter not to say that stock ios is unbearable i lived months on my without jailbreak and was okay with it but even if apple incorporated every single tweak and feature i listed id still want root access simply because it makes me feel like i can do whatever i want with the phone
jailbreak,not_removed,i just jailbreak to fix apples stupid design decisions such as no mobile data toggle in the control center or similar comparable lackoffeatures also have you seen ios control center im not usually one to bash on apple design but my god is that thing retarded huge night shift bar that occupies the same space as an entire row of toggles when it can easily be squeezed in as an additional toggle button not to mention who the hell actually manually toggles night shift sliders that slide in the same direction that the cc scrolls its way to easy to scroll to the music view when youre just trying to change the brightness why the shit is the music controls its own page anyways so that night shift could get its own useless button its slightly prettier than the old cc but thats just about its only improvement
jailbreak,not_removed,im missing swipeselection the most without a touch enabled device its just annoying to edit text and activator especially to configure the volume keys to have control over my music while my phone is locked these tweaks are worth jailbreaking for
jailbreak,not_removed,i download youtube videos often
jailbreak,not_removed,any tweak i made are not possible in stock ios and even if it was i am sure people would find something they dont like about it at which point a developer can fix it or implement their own version for example assistive touch is used by a lot of people but i didnt like the way you have to tap tap tap to do stuff so i implemented my own version of it sure i could use assistive touch and deal with the annoyances but jailbreaking allowed me to fix it instead its not only about innovation your reasoning feels similar to you having to use only colors for clothing sure it is good enough to get by with but what if you want a purple one its not innovative its just about your preference and choice
jailbreak,not_removed,jailbreaking doesnt have to be about inventing anything new for me it was always about unlocking the phone or meaning being able to do what i want with my phone
jailbreak,not_removed,the king pin activator himself
jailbreak,not_removed,remote messages apple will never do it to protect continuity and its mac but its really worthwhile
jailbreak,not_removed,for me its making my device mine if i dont like how slow it is fuck it ill make it faster i dont like my icons change em just getting rid or adding stuff to make ios that much better to a way i see fit ya feel me
jailbreak,not_removed,theres always new tweaks and bits found to explore for every new ios that gets jailbroken just look at the tweaks that came about solely for ios as ios comes with the and a lot of people have that model my betting is ios will see a similar influx of novel new tweaks for me ill still jailbreak to get rid of youtube ads and customise aspects of my phone to how i like them i cant stand the default icon layout of the wallpaper overlay so those are things i cant wait to sort out that overlay dulls nearly every wallpaper i use and i swear its darkened a bunch since ios
jailbreak,not_removed,recordpause deletecut biolockdown the list goes on geez is op even serious with this post 😒
jailbreak,not_removed,until they add springtomize by default i will be jailbreaking the minute they are released
jailbreak,not_removed,assuming this question is to question the need for jail breaking if you feel the need to ask that question then the pursuit of progress and forward thinking is not your strength creativity and innovation thrives when we dont allow those types of questions to slow us down if we limit our experience to what apple thinks it should be then we are no longer free thinkers and instead just committed followers of the apple way of thinking without any hope of growth the reason you can even read this post is a result of someone who avoided that kind of question
jailbreak,not_removed,virtualhome
jailbreak,not_removed,lylac a quick switcher polus activator
jailbreak,not_removed,filesystem backups and restores
jailbreak,not_removed,for me its as simple as changing the default browser i use chrome on all my devices and frequently use the tab handoff feature so the ability to make chrome my default mobile browser is a must i highly doubt apple will ever incorporate this feature into ios so ill jailbreak for as long as i can
jailbreak,not_removed,what i missed before being able to jailbreak my se apples swipeselection doesnt work on devices without force touch afaik 😕 flux is better than night shift i noticed an increase in image quality when i got flux again also i keep flux on to a lesser extent during the day night shift doesnt have that option unless you manually adjust it all the time to be moreless orange custom cc toggles and buttons particularly having the settings button right there i get really annoyed without foldercloser activator its not as bad now that i got a bluetooth remote for music controls i used to use long volume button presses but still auxo or whatever other tweaks have quick swipe actions for app changing i love that on my ipad also jailbroken but its a stock feature and macbook its jarring to not have it on my iphone scrobbled i cant see myself giving up jailbreak unless at least most of those were stock yeah i managed okay for a couple months im not one of the people thatd switch to android without a jailbreak i dont mind stock ios overall and i dont make drastic changes to it just subtle ones but i was thrilled when i could jailbreak again something was missing until then now my se is perfect 😊 well i do wish it could fit the taptic engine inside i hate the old vibration and actually use the led flash instead
jailbreak,not_removed,for me its the novelty tweaks like graviboard and hooks law those are the reasons i jailbroke devs should add more novelty tweaks as well as al these uisystem tweaks its what makes jailbreaking fun having something unique and exciting
jailbreak,not_removed,this is what happens when you get bored of jailbreaking trust me when i say thats not suppose to happen
jailbreak,not_removed,reason i still jailbreak when there is a jailbreak flux senddelay icleaner priority hub customizing from springtomize more app features from phantom and rocket for instagram like you have said with ios adding more of these features there becomes less of a need to jailbreak but lets be honest apple is never going to add all the features people want from the jailbreak community so for some there will always be a need to jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,they still havent done quick compose for imessagesms they havent done a callbar like scenario where you can takereceive calls and not be interrupted and as you said no theming scene i think that with apple adding new features all the time will come the need for new tweaks to enhance or replace those new additions made by apple i personally prefer jbn to stock obviously and its a little torturous running stock so if jailbreaking were to last forever id jailbreak every idevice i buy or will buy
jailbreak,not_removed,even if apple implemented all my favorite jailbreak features into stock ioswhich will never happen i would still need to jailbreak for tethermewhich will definitely never be implemented into stock ios
jailbreak,not_removed,swipe selection is in ios but super charged so two of your three are in stock but there are still tweaks for thirdparty touch opens a massive new area to develop ideas for control center is still frustratingly rigid but improving needs more cards things like that
jailbreak,not_removed,security you wont find any better security without jailbreaking
jailbreak,not_removed,not to mention that jailbreaking has more and more things to tweak as apple adds more and more features just so they can make extra money from s models
jailbreak,not_removed,could name plenty of others but the most obvious to me is polus apple added the cc over years ago as a big new feature and after all this time itd still probably be almost useless to me if i wasnt jailbroken with a jailbreak i use it constantly
jailbreak,not_removed,agree with all the tweaks but is there some core functionality or inefficiencies still left to address at its best the jb scene was adding unheard of functions flux tether ftp swipe selection eclipse many of which are being integrated slowly into ios
jailbreak,not_removed,didnt they add similar features in to safari
jailbreak,not_removed,no mobile data toggle in the control center that one pissed me off the most when they introduced ios three years later and the control center is as useless on stock as it was before apple is dumbing everything down to the point where its becoming frustrating to do basic functions their software decisions have been very crappy lately across ios and macos
jailbreak,not_removed,try out gboard by google it has integrated swipeselection on the space key
jailbreak,not_removed,good analogy some of us can find happiness with whats on the rack but i get what youre saying there can be a better path to certain features that apple hasnt implemented
jailbreak,not_removed,rip virtual home
jailbreak,not_removed,you can use fingers to move the cursor on devices without touch
jailbreak,not_removed,tweaks for security
jailbreak,not_removed,there are some things i doubt apple will ever touch look at springtomize activator
jailbreak,not_removed,same surprised they still havent added it yet
jailbreak,not_removed,there will always be something apple misses doesnt get quite right etc same thing with app store development
jailbreak,not_removed,yes and no content blockers only work in safari or web view there are a few apps on the app store now that let you block certain domains through a dummy vpn but performance wise a large hosts file was much more stable for me loading those same domains into the dummy vpn app the vpn app would block system wide though and act similar to a hosts file
jailbreak,not_removed,sort of but mhb works globally
jailbreak,not_removed,why should he hes jailbroken and can use the complete native keyboard for swiping not only a tiny space bar as many said before it is the little things you can tweak swipeselection swipeexpander activator virtualhome and you often also can have features that are not meant for your device by apple eg swipeselection as long as apple does not implement swipeselection and swipeexpander on its native keyboard for all devices not only the the new ones i will jailbreak long live jailbreaking
jailbreak,not_removed,unfortunately
jailbreak,not_removed,oh cool thanks i thought i looked that up when i wasnt jailbroken and couldnt find anything
jailbreak,not_removed,yes like icaughtu pro
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah but thats just because too much customisation is scary for apple like a caveman seeing fire for the first time
jailbreak,not_removed,hes not jailbroken it says ios right there next to his username
jailbreak,not_removed,its also bad business sense if springtomize and activator were ios native the level of support calls would probably triple meaning theyd have to hire more support staff driving prices up unfortunately in this instance you cant have your cake and eat it
jailbreak,not_removed,think its a balance job most users would make a giant fk up if they had access to these likes of hidemexactivator etc so it will be partly them managing the amount of returns they need to deal with that are user created probs worth ✌️
jailbreak,not_removed,you are so right 😊 then a tiny space bar to swipe the cursor is better than nothing 😉
jailbreak,not_removed,also bad marketing most people have horrible taste and if ios had stock theme support it would be a sea of ugly iphones with no one other than the owner able to use them without being confused this imo far more than support calls is the reason why it wont ever happen
jailbreak,not_removed,if you boot your device you have to resign the ipa with impactor cydia stays tweaks stay but dont work untill you do so
jailbreak,not_removed,but only if you reboot right if you dont nothing will happen
jailbreak,not_removed,only if you reboot if you dont youll be jailbroken as long as you keep device running
jailbreak,not_removed,wont be long till you find out
jailbreak,not_removed,that is the charm nomatter what you do it will reboot destined to do so 😂
jailbreak,not_removed,if you not reboot you still have to sign yalu ipa againafter days your jailbreak its not working
jailbreak,not_removed,thats sound good thanks for da info

jailbreak,not_removed,hello thank you for your participation in rjailbreak however your submission was removed for the following reasons posts about sideloading should be posted to rsideloaded if you have any questions about this removal please feel free to
jailbreak,not_removed,dont think so youll need to go back to or ask apple to downgrade the watch
jailbreak,not_removed,while this discussion is fresh who here has since updated their jailbroken iphone from and uses an apple watch did you start from a fresh restore or did you restore from a backup to keep your apple watch history in the past i made the mistake of not encrypting it and that lost the watchs data so i am just trying to cover all angles before i upgrade to
jailbreak,not_removed,i sent my watch to downgrade to from beta and apple sent me a brand new watch d
jailbreak,not_removed,wath would you prefer jailbreak or ios
jailbreak,not_removed,i did everything is pretty much there but for a while i could not update from to on the watch app the update showed up but when i clicked on it the spinning circle started but went back to the same screen idk why but it just wouldnt update so i tried to set up the watch as new and was finally able to get it on after i got it to update i was able to load my backup on it and now everything is good oh yeah i did a restore on my phone set it up as new then loaded my backup before loading the jb
jailbreak,not_removed,jailbreak while its available and then when i switch to iphone in the fall ios will be up on that maybe with a jb shortly after if were lucky either way take your watch to the apple store if youve already updated to watch beta theyll send it in for downgrade for free and let you know when its back
jailbreak,not_removed,jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,just what i needed to hear to push me over that edge i think ill be ready for shortly
jailbreak,not_removed,repo is incorrect it has a typo it should be httpbetaunlimappscom
jailbreak,not_removed,id first try to close cydia and then respring after that go to cydia and refresh then try again
jailbreak,not_removed,issue with the repo not your phone
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,well dont use so much the battery under between its optimal if you let die battery often the capacity may decrease
jailbreak,not_removed,my iphone that ive had since release is at i rarely let it die and it never gets uncomfortably hot one thing to note is i almost never play games on it
jailbreak,not_removed,yea ive had my for about the same since december and mine at and i constantly use those mophie portable battery packs with the fast charge cables that supposedly arent good for them but i rarely let it die i always try and keep it over charged must be why mines doing so much better i also notice tho that app reads differ depending on your charges when my battery is at around it reads capacity and when its between and fully charged it reads
jailbreak,not_removed,well my is at after cycles so i guess its still good generally just try not to expose your device to too much heat and dont overheat it since mobile phones dont have fanscooling systems unlike pcslaptops
jailbreak,not_removed,how does your already have so many charge cycles ive had my since april and it has for year and months compared to your in just months i do charge every night so the sounds consistent with the time period i mentioned health is the same as yours your cycle count should be around unless youre charging a day
jailbreak,not_removed,what tweak is this or app need to check mine p thnx
jailbreak,not_removed,wow ive had mines since release months and mines is at capacity but then my cycles is only at
jailbreak,not_removed,i got my on launch day and have capacity
jailbreak,not_removed,what i found that works for me is to actually discharge to percent and then charge up to and i dont mean when it says but when the charging current stops being greenreads full or has begun to discharge
jailbreak,not_removed,had my for months cycles is that bad
jailbreak,not_removed,that looks to be about average considering how long youve owned the device as well how often you use itiphone batteries tend to be rather easy to swap out though but i wouldnt do it within the warranty period unless you want to lose your jailbreak and take it to apple to get your battery replaced i agree that you should attempt to never let your phone get any lower than charge but also dont do like me and keep it plugged in almost of the time like i tend to do when i am home if you find yourself running low on juice before the day is over with you might want to consider investing in a small usb battery pack that will not only charge your battery back up to full charge but run the device off of that current while charging i believe that this is how it works and that it doesnt always draw its power from the battery thats topped up directly from the charger itself this makes me wonder if there would be a way to develop a tweak that would only charge your phone to say instead of and then trickle charge so that your phones battery stayed in the optimal range and prolonged battery life for people who keep their devices plugged in more often than not
jailbreak,not_removed,thats pretty bad get the battery replaced
jailbreak,not_removed,its definitely still good not ideal but still good when you dip below the capacity mark youll want to think about changing it out im at around charge cycles and my battery capacity fluctuates between ive also had my for roughly months
jailbreak,not_removed,hows my iphone hoping itll last until iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,looks fair enough to me your battery is expected to go down to in a year i think dont fret battery maintenance its way too much workeffort for battery that costs so little to change
jailbreak,not_removed,yikes i let it die a lot
jailbreak,not_removed,my battery is better i guess this is just pure luck
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah the heck are they doing to their phones gone thru hell and back cycles at
jailbreak,not_removed,i do charge twice a day is that bad for the battery
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,geez do you like rarely use your phone lol cause thats good
jailbreak,not_removed,dude this is just faulty get it replaced
jailbreak,not_removed,shit man thats terrible i would get that replaced
jailbreak,not_removed,not bad but not good either for that amount of cycles when you dip below the capacity mark is when youll want to think about getting a new battery i have about cycles and my capacity is at about ive had my for roughly months
jailbreak,not_removed,really mine on a iphone has only gone down to and i have had my phone for a yr and months i rarely let my battery die though and i always use the charger that was provided with the phone and the same cable
jailbreak,not_removed,according to tesla owners the awesome battery powered cars between is optimal and also degrees celsius is where a battery like to be i trust these guys advice as they know how to keep a battery in a healthy state and what they say doesnt just apply to their cars but all lithium ion batteries in general try to keep you battery in this range for maximum longevity edit here is my battery wear perfect
jailbreak,not_removed,apple says do it one per month thats all if you do it constantly yes the battery suffer a lot
jailbreak,not_removed,i just bought a mophie powerbank on ebay for like and it charges my phone twice over you should look into one i bought my fiance one for total and it charges and a half times mophie also i always charge when i hit about and have always had good capacity through iphones according to battery life
jailbreak,not_removed,what apptweak is that
jailbreak,not_removed,not necessarily bad but your charging habits will determine all i charge when i get to roughly and my capacity has always been good through iphones also the more usage the quicker itll diminish and the quicker youll need to replace it which isnt a huge deal as good party batteries arent overly expensive

jailbreak,not_removed,it does sit in my pocket a lot comp sci grad student so always on my computer instead haha the capacity fluctuates right when i open the batterylife app usually its around but it goes up for some reason after the app refreshes
jailbreak,not_removed,i think batteries are worse off than the ones placed in its been well over a year for my as well and im on capacity
jailbreak,not_removed,yea because its expected to go down to after cycles thats about a year or so httpwwwapplecombatteriesserviceandrecycling to quote them iphone owners your battery is designed to retain up to of its original capacity at complete charge cycles the oneyear warranty includes service coverage for a defective battery if it is out of warranty apple offers a battery service for plus shipping subject to local tax
jailbreak,not_removed,im guessing mine is bad httpimgurcomvzehzse
jailbreak,not_removed,yep agreed from what ive read again from tesla the reason you should cycle every now and then is to move the electrons around replaces the old electrons with new ones its quite interesting actually when you start reading about it im excited for some of the new solid state batteries that are in development now we are looking at ten times the storage with the same battery size or alternatively ten times smaller batteries with the same output and with little to zero battery degradation after hundreds of thousands of cycles exciting times
jailbreak,not_removed,battery life in the app store
jailbreak,not_removed,still at with my after months
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i think some are worse off mines at capacity most of the times i check
jailbreak,not_removed,yep is it under warranty
jailbreak,not_removed,if these go into mass production soon i really think the model will be a market dominator as long as they can keep up with demand
jailbreak,not_removed,nice
jailbreak,not_removed,i heard the reason to fully drain it then fully charge it once a month was to calibrate the battery monitor
jailbreak,not_removed,is it consider good i feel like mine is dying soon i would need at least charges per day
jailbreak,not_removed,nope it passed the year already
jailbreak,not_removed,for sure imagine a model s with a range or even a range with half the battery weight the second time would drop even less
jailbreak,not_removed,yours is borderline apple will replace it under warranty if its less than months old and has a capacity of less than
jailbreak,not_removed,for cycles it is
jailbreak,not_removed,give them a call anyway wont hurt they told me that i had the worst they can say is no they posted mine to me and even waved the express postage fee i had to speak to a senior apple customer care advisor however but he was very good
jailbreak,not_removed,doubt its less than a year old with cycles
jailbreak,not_removed,true i only glanced at his pic and didnt notice that i only quickly looked at his capacity
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont think so but youtube it
jailbreak,not_removed,actually try
jailbreak,not_removed,explusalphas emulators have wiimote support are they available for
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackagecomorikadcontrollersforall modmyi tweaks adds game controller support for all bleep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks but controllers for all doesnt support wiimote only the wii u controller
jailbreak,not_removed,those are the ones im trying to use and they connect to the wiimote but then when you try to load a game they crash
jailbreak,not_removed,oh didnt realize sorry
jailbreak,not_removed,try and find an older version i had to get of neo emu as newer ones would crash like it does for you if it was neo that you wanted then pm me im on on a though fyi
jailbreak,not_removed,thats a good idea ill try that ios might be different though
jailbreak,not_removed,i use
jailbreak,not_removed,tetherme from the bigboss repo ive been using it as long as i can remember definitely worth the purchase in my opinion it enables the native tethering mode
jailbreak,not_removed,tetherme and use a vpn with tetherme you can force the personal hotspot to send all traffic over the vpn which prevents the carrier from being able to see any of your traffic also if the vpn isnt connected your tethered connection will simply sendreceive no data so no accidentally sending data over an unencrypted cellular connection
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackagenettethermetetherme bigboss networking dynamically enables native tethering bleep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you so much
jailbreak,not_removed,might be a lil bit dumb of me saying this but perhaps backup your phone using itunes
jailbreak,not_removed,syncios is my all time favourite
jailbreak,not_removed,uninstall all itunes related software clean all registry entries and unistall itools reboot and reinstall itunes then itools and that will do the trick
jailbreak,not_removed,thats not what im looking for ill lose a lot of stuff
jailbreak,not_removed,does it let you access to storage system
jailbreak,not_removed,this is the best site for this kind of info httpswwwtheiphonewikicomwikijailbreakexploits and this is a super writeup of taig jailbreak you will find other writeups with google
jailbreak,not_removed,jailbreak is not just mounting root partition as readwrite you also need to disable some security checks and do some modifications of os i think the trick with changing files in ipsw doesnt work getting and installing cydia is one of the latest steps you should not care about it for now you just need to google about there is many use cases of hash functions as you dont know what is it means that you are a beginner so heres a rough instructions of what you need to do to archive jailbreak there are many ways of how you can archive jailbreak but what you really should want is to be able to modify kernel heres one of the way of how you can jailbreak your device find a bug to run arbitrary code with root permission usually you need it for many reasons for instance many kernel bugs can be exploited only with root bypass sandboxing if you are sandboxed you still cant run some functions even with root bypass codesigning if you want to run a modified binary find a kernel bug to be able to run code as kernel or get access to kernel the goal is to be able to patch it patch kernel disable some security checks mount filesystem as rw only after kernel patch you can do it disable sandboxing codesigning and other not needed security checks install cydia make jailbreak untethered so at first you need to find of how you can run arbitrary code with root permissions one of the famous technics is to find a bug in one of ios apps that run with root permissions and inject your code in it by expoliting this bug you can search for old vulnerabilities and try to exploit it too get some experience be ready to spend all of your spare time on searching and learning for at least a half of year before you will be able to make your own jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,good luck making a jailbreak man skilled security researchers cant even do it and make it stable at the moment
jailbreak,not_removed,is a hash algorithm and its purpose is taking data and creates a unique series of bytes to represent said data
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you so much ill do some research and go from there
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you no offense taken i understand
jailbreak,not_removed,you are biting off a million times more than you can chew it sounds like you dont know much about ioss inner workings as it is i recommend learning more about ios first and then comes learning objc assembly and c have you looked at a nix kernel and studied it closely do you know how they work if you do you should disassemble the ios kernel and study that closely as well ios has many layers of low level kernel protection you have to know how to beat those using sometimes very lengthy chains of exploits im not trying to be mean but honestly you can try but you will give up and get frustrated before you get anywhere it takes years of hard work in order to learn how to exploit an os written by a multibillion dollar corporation to get root access
jailbreak,not_removed,why gave you the motivation to do this
jailbreak,not_removed,also i think the etcprivatefstab method cannot be used anymore but i can be completely wrong about that
jailbreak,not_removed,everyones gotta start somewhere
jailbreak,not_removed,its the battery i had the same issue on my iphone changed it myself and back to normal you must consider yourself lucky because at least your phone dies at my old battery used to die at haha
jailbreak,not_removed,i got my battery and tools from repairsuniversecom
jailbreak,not_removed,glad i found this post mine is at capacity 😢
jailbreak,not_removed,have you tried this in no substrate mode to eliminate the possibility of it being jb related even thought they said it was fine you can also try disabling tweaks with icleanerpro and turning them on one by one using your device for a bit in between toggling to see if it starts again
jailbreak,not_removed,download batterylife from cydia or app store how many cycles capacity i think maybe your charging habits may affect it regular charging above
jailbreak,not_removed,change the battery it solves the problem mine did the same
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone jb on dies quickly and turns off at when i plug it in to charge it immediately boots up and shows battery my overall battery life is terrible ive had it looked at by apple who said the battery is fine sums up my experience and mines currently on stock apple said it was fine but its only gotten worse ive restored several times and even tried setting it up as new no luck definitely seems like a hardware issue at this rate im just trying to wait a couple months until the comes out id recommend getting an external battery pack and keeping it handy if you dont already have one
jailbreak,not_removed,mine died at like percent yesterday im on ios so i dont think its jb related more of the condition of your phone my phone has been ran over and has had its screen replaced twice
jailbreak,not_removed,do a battery calibration and see if the capacity gets better i had around after doing a calibration times im on
jailbreak,not_removed,dude go to apple and restore or semi restore your phone and tell them this is really an issue so you need to avoid these thirdparts spares as they are not original and they will never be go with your warranty thank you for the downvotes rjailbreak no wonder theres no jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you for this idea ill do it while my battery is on the way just to be sure
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you for your help cycles capacity time for a new battery
jailbreak,not_removed,how difficult is the process
jailbreak,not_removed,surprisingly calibrating did seem to help now up to still planning on replacing however
jailbreak,not_removed,apple will update the phone though to rule out software issues
jailbreak,not_removed,my warranty is expired
jailbreak,not_removed,i just want to know why i got downvoted is trying to help here that bad
jailbreak,not_removed,nah anything lower than especially on a is awful and you cant even get a good days worth of use out of it
jailbreak,not_removed,anytime man i hope it works or you at least get to the bottom of the issue shit like this is definitely frustrating
jailbreak,not_removed,definitely apple is full of shit if your capacity is at and they said its fine
jailbreak,not_removed,are you kidding me yes get a new battery sorry for all caps but the genius who told you that your battery is fine is a moron
jailbreak,not_removed,just replaced my iphone battery about a couple months ago the battery is glued with some strong adhesive to the back plate apparently there are some pull tabs along the narrow edge of the battery i missed all you need to do is pull them straight out i wasnt aware of this and instead used a hair dryer metal spudgers and a couple fbombs to try and pry the battery off the back plate the nice part was i was able to reuse the glue as most of it stuck to the plate youll need to have double sided tape to secure the battery back in if you use the pull tabs original video i used httpsyoutubeugmtnjuqehi authors updated video for
jailbreak,not_removed,try to always use it till then charging full and i think if its too cold or too hot the phone shuts down ar higher
jailbreak,not_removed,forget calibration bloody waste of time when a replacement battery costs a few bucks at most btw i replaced my batteries twice and they seem to last on the average months the first battery was maybe bucks from ebay it came with about cycles but i didnt complain for that price and the second one was from china the china one seemed totally legit in the first place with no charge cycles and close to health however when it approached months my phone started to shutdown erratically battery health was still showing that its good after changing back to the previous batteries i realized they hacked the gas gauge of the battery to get rid of the cycles
jailbreak,not_removed,apparently so the number of butthurt people on reddit goes up exponentially when you come near this subreddit so i guess its to be expected if youre not the first to be a witty dick to somebody here come the downvotes
jailbreak,not_removed,alright thank you do you have any battery vendors that you recommend
jailbreak,not_removed,they did one of the remote troubleshooting things
jailbreak,not_removed,ebay or amazon probably
jailbreak,not_removed,the only place i know to get a battery is from apple but idk what theyll say if they see your jailbroken it is a hardware issue but weve had reports of them unnecessarily bricking phones before just to be dicks
jailbreak,not_removed,that explains a lot
jailbreak,not_removed,so the cheapy onesifixit essentially trying to decide if its worth for a more reputable brand
jailbreak,not_removed,i really dont want to run that risk and theres not an apple store near me my phone is not on warranty and i am very comfortable doing the replacement myself i appreciate the heads up though thats good to know
jailbreak,not_removed,with some exceptions when you can see that somethings obviously wrong ifixit basically gets their stuff from the same places that the ebay sellers do even if the branding isnt there the batteries tools etc that youre getting are nearly always the exact same quality as what youd pay more for through ifixit skip the peace of mind tax and pick your stuff up off of ebay or amazon via a seller who has virtually perfect feedback and good feedback on the items youre looking to purchase ive yet received any bad parts that way and have been fixing iphones since
jailbreak,not_removed,opposite in terms of ifixit some of their parts are oem some of them are leftovers and some of them are knockoffs if you pay attention and read the descriptions then you can find the products that are oem and they are well worth the cost been ordering from them for years and only once ever had a problem—a single subpixel on a retina iphone screen was dead so they sent me a new screen and replacement kit free of charge
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah apple isnt nearly the only source what seconds of ebay searching yielded me the seller has sold literally thousands of those kits has positive feedback and has a money back guarantee return policy if you happen to get a defective unit im not pushing for this particular seller but seeing as they primarily deal with cell phone accessories batteries what negatives they have received look akin to the normal percentage of failures youll see amidst any sort of batteries you might buy definitely worth the minimal risk involved
jailbreak,not_removed,i just replaced my iphone battery a week or two ago for battery and tools idk how battery compares cant be much different
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks will do
jailbreak,not_removed,i havent had a chance to work on a yet but a friend who has says that its the easiest to open iphone yet in comparison to the others looking at guides online it looks like a slightly less fussy version of the process including pulling the battery out the only bad part of battery replacement is if those stupid adhesive strips under the battery break when youre trying to get the old one out ive never snagged one on anything applied excessive force etc but they always snap on me and i end up having to dig the original battery out without bendingpuncturingetc it which is no fun at all
jailbreak,not_removed,you cant its not being signed
jailbreak,not_removed,you cant restore now its too late i got the pp app but the circle goes away what do you mean
jailbreak,not_removed,this is so confusing because of the way you worded it if youre on then why did you mention does your settings general about say that you are on or if you are on then you should be able to jailbreak try the safari method make sure to do the whole trust certificate thing as well if that doesnt work then im sorry man
jailbreak,not_removed,since i havent upgraded to i cant use the app because it crashes on the pp app thats too bad if you dont mind me asking is there an alternate way i can jailbreak on having trouble finding a way
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry for the wording i meant to say when i go to update it in the settings it tells me to update to i tried that method and many more but the start circle loads then the other chinese words appear for about a second then it reverts back to the start button
jailbreak,not_removed,the app works fine on what device is it
jailbreak,not_removed,when the circle loads you lock your device right you shouldnt be looking at the circle at all basically you just tap and then lock your device until you see the apple logo sorry if its a dumb suggestion you probably already do this but just making sure because ios should be able to be jailbroken without any issues whatsoever
jailbreak,not_removed,im using an iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,this make sure you tap the circle then wait seconds as stated in the text and lock phone with sleep button with english version i found waiting two seconds before locking is the sweet spot but others rash it doesnt matter i just find that those times are what work for me
jailbreak,not_removed,ok just checking pangu should work fine on that try this reboot hold homepower until the device blinks out then shows the apple logo close all apps in the switcher open pppangu wait seconds tap circlestart wait seconds hit power
jailbreak,not_removed,i didnt even know it said to wait seconds lmao i just locked as soon as i pressed it and it has always worked fine also uofficerkappa make sure you have enabled notifications for the app if you tapped on no when it asked you to allow them i do it to every single app because they are annoying then go to settings notifications and enable that shit for pp
jailbreak,not_removed,just tried this but the same thing happens i tap the circlestart then it goes to the other text then almost immediately goes back to the circle maybe i need to try a different download link idk ill keep looking i appreciate the help though
jailbreak,not_removed,ah yes notifications a vital step for the jailbreaak to succeed
jailbreak,not_removed,try the english ipa with impactor links are in the sticky post at the top of the page
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks but i tried this earlier today and no luck it downloaded the app onto my device but when i hit the start button it said below if i can remember correctly something like incompatible with jailbreak try again later i guess its just not my day
jailbreak,not_removed,did you try using the safari method
jailbreak,not_removed,check settings general about what does version say
jailbreak,not_removed,could you link it please probably not
jailbreak,not_removed,it says is mine not bit or are all iphone nothing seems to work even though people with the same version and device as me it has been its weird
jailbreak,not_removed,everything and newer is
jailbreak,not_removed,find itunes libraryitl in the itunes folder and just delete it
jailbreak,not_removed,for pc music itunes it should be in that folder
jailbreak,not_removed,yes useless but wait for updates on prometheus
jailbreak,not_removed,will do thank god now i can disconnect my phone from my computer
jailbreak,not_removed,you only needed to run the program when you were sleeping
jailbreak,not_removed,youll know its out when its stickied on the front page of this subreddit
jailbreak,not_removed,come on mods your really letting these posts in the sub
jailbreak,not_removed,hello ive removed your post because you mentioned jailbreak status ios is jailbreakable semitethered using pp only ios is jailbreakable untethered using pangu httpenpanguio only ios is jailbreakable untethered using pangu httpenpanguio please refer to the sidebar for more information
jailbreak,not_removed,done
jailbreak,not_removed,youre instead of your
jailbreak,not_removed,try spotlight search otherwise try resigning cert airplane mode
jailbreak,not_removed,what do you mean does the settings app crash when you try to open it did you have it locked with bioprotect or biolockdown
jailbreak,not_removed,i guess you already tried to reboot the phone can you open apps via siri or the appswitcher
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah and no i dont have it locked with either and its not only the settings app but rather every single stock ios app
jailbreak,not_removed,probably cause its trying to save you from screwing yourself over
jailbreak,not_removed,if your sure that you know its safe to do that you could use upscale instead but you could really fuck itself over if your not sure its a compatable resolution
jailbreak,not_removed,could be but how can i change it to the ipad pro resolution while littlebrother doesnt let me
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont wanna risk my jailbreak phone because i dont have a functional computer right now which is the reason i dont wanna use upscale
jailbreak,not_removed,fursure maybe email ryan petrich about it
jailbreak,not_removed,raises hand slowly
jailbreak,not_removed,guys why dont you leave space for people who really had problems with like op asked its not really of any help to go through replies which all state that they had no problem when you want to get an overview of who actually had problems if you dont reply here then obviously everything went well for you dont get me wrong i just think this would be way better for the sake of visibility
jailbreak,not_removed,most people had to restore because of a tweak and not because of the jailbreak so cant really blame yalu
jailbreak,not_removed,lol yep was taking phone into apple for a replacement battery so i deleted cydia and other apps not a problem i was in the process of putting cydia and bits n bobs back on the phone using puttymterminalifile when ifile through a wobbler and decided to delete all the lib files from my lib folder grr shoulda been using filza but hadnt got round to installing it thought id replaced them all but obviously i missed an important lib upshot was a boot loop wouldnt be a problem with untethered and ssh but on this jb i was furked find my phone reported my phone as offline so had to restore to and spent a day trying to get prometheus working properly dependency problem after problem at this point my gf rang me and i couldnt hear her only worked on speaker phone went to genius bar and they gave me a new device on very lucky win am now on the tsmc chip so cant jb yet technically cant blame the jb other than the fact its semitethered was my own fault for using crappy ifile
jailbreak,not_removed,appsync 😐😐lost my jb just because of it🤐 now on jb will never install now
jailbreak,not_removed,i did a reset on mine bc i lost mobile data that was before i learned you could get around that but all is good now i do have random resprings while in jailbreak modebut i just reboot and go back to normal until i need the jailbreak i mainly use it for game cheatshacks
jailbreak,not_removed,well i got some repo issues in cydia so finally deleted my phone with find my iphone to restore it now i have a blankempty cydia so cant do anything or install any tweak cant restore the iphone because i dont want to update it to any idea to save my jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,i had beta all was fine tried to install beta didnt work so i went back to and when i opened cydia the next time it started doing that stashing thing or so and from then on i got bootlooped and now im on and my blobs are trash because blobs wont work
jailbreak,not_removed,the only problem i am having is wifi calling not working nor is volte simultaneous voice and data even after the cellular data fix this problem persists and others have had the problem as well one of my pluses started working after a couple days so im hoping my main plus does the same
jailbreak,not_removed,me luckily i have a iphone plus on
jailbreak,not_removed,i havent had to restore at all every now and then my system reboots itself but very minimal some tweaks have not played so nicely with caused springboard to crash and reboot other than that im perfectly content with yalu
jailbreak,not_removed,installed yalu everything was going good then got the no service in top left treid everything i knew reset thru icloud cydia and substrate fix still have icons on my phone tried couple times to go thru jailbreak process and installed ifile thru cydia impactor to try and remove both with no luck so i gave up for the time being
jailbreak,not_removed,im just waiting for cydia eraser or an update i installed ios emojis and now i cant active substrate so no tweaks work really annoying
jailbreak,not_removed,ssh got fucked up on my device i thought reset all content and settings would fix it nope i got into dfu mode with a progress bar that never advanced after about half an hour i gave up and hard reset i got a set up your iphone screen i was so happy i hadnt fucked up my phone ssh still doesnt work but im still jailbroken fine
jailbreak,not_removed,had to restore thanks to yucca utilities
jailbreak,not_removed,ive run for about a week now no real issues other than glitchy semi tether and obvious substrate not working properly only issue i had was i put icleaner on before it was updated then the new icleaner came out i updated and it hasnt worked since even removing and going back to the old i believe the stashing tweak messed up something with it but im too nervous to remove stashing now so will live with the broken icleaner for now other than the stashingicleaner issue ive had no permanent issues with yet i am on
jailbreak,not_removed,ive had it all this time and have about tweaks most of them on the compability sheet and havent had any problems
jailbreak,not_removed,i have a using yalu beta with substrate installed ive had it jailbroken since the day it was released and have not had to restore i do run into some random reboots when excessively using ifile but nothing beyond that just gotta be careful of what you install right now
jailbreak,not_removed,deleted
jailbreak,not_removed,im sorry for your loss
jailbreak,not_removed,hi my name is bob and im a jailbreak restorer hi bob sorry for your loss condolences
jailbreak,not_removed,rip
jailbreak,not_removed,ifile is old the only thing i use it for is moving files in and out of my documents folder and applications folder
jailbreak,not_removed,appsync causes boot loops as the google docs shows on ios but there is no way it will do that on assuming youre using appsync unified from karens pineapple
jailbreak,not_removed,howon ive used appsync on every jb ive hadu mustve got a dodgy versionnever had no probs with itmaybe i will on ios never had issues on any previous ios o
jailbreak,not_removed,with you on that one im waiting for my to be supported but i will be very careful of app sync in the future
jailbreak,not_removed,actually you shouldnt jailbreak i think that people who arent not techfriendlystupid shouldnt jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry for your loss fingers crossed jb is released for you friend
jailbreak,not_removed,what about removing sim rebooting and putting sim back in and rebooting again
jailbreak,not_removed,me
jailbreak,not_removed,i was a hardcore fan of ifile until i tried filza havent missed ifile at all cant imagine using it again over filza
jailbreak,not_removed,carful using ifile unless its been updated on and i missed it ifile has a pretty bad glitch you need to be carful about i heard if you delete something it will delete the last viewed on in the same spot
jailbreak,not_removed,i found the apple employee
jailbreak,not_removed,care to elaborate what did you install have you tried a hard reset
jailbreak,not_removed,haha unless you smashed it with a hammer theres no bricking involved get outta here mr cook
jailbreak,not_removed,made the mistake of installing appsync so i wouldnt have to resign kodi every days ended up in a bootloop and didnt find out about the find my iphone remote erase fix until after i restored
jailbreak,not_removed,lol wrong sub to complain about it
jailbreak,not_removed,i had ifile and mterminal before erasing the device but now these apps are not working ifile is crashing at the time i open it and mterminal simply shows a msg like cant fork in a sandbox or something like this i guess that ifile and mterminal didnt recognize the jailbreak anymore or maybe theyre partially broken i tried to install a new terminal using impactor but i get the same error msg also openssh doesnt work too i get connection refused with winscpputty
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you for this reference was looking for this
jailbreak,not_removed,tried it no luck
jailbreak,not_removed,what is better in filza edit gonna try
jailbreak,not_removed,its a troll you cant just break your phone
jailbreak,not_removed,wait i thought you could get kodi on cydia can you not do that
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i know and im happy that ppl downvote me because my comment feels like im one of those guys who are like do not jailbreak its a beta etc but im not my english is just bad and i cant explain it clearly im mean this guy is stupid he can fix the data problem there is a popup that actually pop on your screen to tell you what you have to do to make it work if he cant fix this im sure he will mess up with his phone look he have some random respring its a kernel panic i think which leads to a reboot so after a reboot he reboot lel if the average jailbreaker want to jailbreak he should but this guy seems way below the average jailbreaker
jailbreak,not_removed,did you try side loading machportal again that would be the only ways you can open those apps
jailbreak,not_removed,damn
jailbreak,not_removed,for me ease of use it is more intuitive and i feel the search function is superior it gives the app folder location by the actual app name instead of the long string of characters that represent each app within the filesystem it has touch id secure login it is also frequently updated whereas ifile hasnt been updated for an extremely long time also there was a weird bug in ifile that would sometimes cause trouble for people as it would delete something cant recall what it was exactly but i know filza never had it just my cents
jailbreak,not_removed,everything just try it
jailbreak,not_removed,well you could do this example but its highly unlikely
jailbreak,not_removed,you can
jailbreak,not_removed,im glad youre undermining someone because of a simple issue and their verbiage you shouldnt use this sub because then of these kids shouldnt jailbreak its not like most are contributors or devs but neither are you so why does it matter to you
jailbreak,not_removed,do you mean with impactor i installed machportal again using impactor and then opened it i can open cydia but ifilefilzamterminal keeps crashing
jailbreak,not_removed,guess he did not know that poor guy
jailbreak,not_removed,because why not btw im studying informatic and i want to develop tweaks when i learn c so i will be a dev and yeah it matter to me 😘 ps pls downvote since the jailbreak release i won karma for helping ppl its too much
jailbreak,not_removed,yes that is what i meant odd maybe try running substrate and then ifile
jailbreak,not_removed,tfw
jailbreak,not_removed,i cant run substrate because mterminal and openssh are not working tt ill try to run ssh over usb
jailbreak,not_removed,at least you know now for the future
jailbreak,not_removed,lets hope a jb can save you i mean you know how to install and parameter kodis extentions with fusion and all that complex stuffbut you didnt know a deb version exists in kodis wiki cmon
jailbreak,not_removed,damn should have just deal with the repo issues apparently thats fixed with the newest cydia update too
jailbreak,not_removed,you cant youd have to upgrade to which is latest
jailbreak,not_removed,you can only update to a signed firmware ios or but there is no jailbreak for those firmware
jailbreak,not_removed,or on my iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,on my id probably stay where i am on my though
jailbreak,not_removed,well my daily driver is already on the version i want it to be but my is going straight to
jailbreak,not_removed,easy take all blobs
jailbreak,not_removed,👻
jailbreak,not_removed,or alternatively
jailbreak,not_removed,absolutely im iphone and surly save all blobs😍
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,honestly is perfectly fine its the latest and it has practically all tweaks id ever use
jailbreak,not_removed,hands down
jailbreak,not_removed,on my and on my air
jailbreak,not_removed,is better than imo and the se runs better with it
jailbreak,not_removed,majority says n i also agree its the fast n smoothest of all
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,on my and on my ipad
jailbreak,not_removed,without a doubt
jailbreak,not_removed,i would go to but save blobs for
jailbreak,not_removed,firstly to just try it out then then then
jailbreak,not_removed,on my
jailbreak,not_removed,im on on my which im pretty happy with so i would probably stay where i am
jailbreak,not_removed,ios
jailbreak,not_removed,why all the love for did people just not like or was it just super stable or what
jailbreak,not_removed,ios on iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,ive given up hope that this will happen
jailbreak,not_removed,the servers arent down stop spreading misinformation
jailbreak,not_removed,cz battery drainage on i am on btw
jailbreak,not_removed,possibly ios or on my current firmware ios
jailbreak,not_removed,ios on my ipad mini
jailbreak,not_removed,the best firmware i have ever had on my old iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,i guess on my it was the version it came on and it run smooth as fuck really regretted updating to
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone i dont know which one is really better but less and less apps are supported for my and i want my phone to hold out as long as possible
jailbreak,not_removed,on my iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,ios
jailbreak,not_removed,since many apps still support it it will boost speed and i can keep coolbooter with hence my flair
jailbreak,not_removed,on my favorite so far
jailbreak,not_removed,ios on my ios on my since i have another one one iphone to from iphone from to is currently crashing my camera app quite often
jailbreak,not_removed,or on
jailbreak,not_removed,but they dont have that for the iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,if i still had my i wouldve downgraded to but for now im happy with on my
jailbreak,not_removed,ios is awful for me widgets bs music heath app disaster
jailbreak,not_removed,tbh
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone iphone iphone ftw
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone se
jailbreak,not_removed,my ipad air to nothing because its on perfect my ipad to ios my ipad to ios
jailbreak,not_removed,id save all blobs and downgrade to as i have pg client
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone on no dual boot iphone on iphone plus on
jailbreak,not_removed,is this actually a possibility
jailbreak,not_removed,ipod touch ipod touch iphone iphone ipad but of course i would save all blobs for all versions
jailbreak,not_removed,all the way
jailbreak,not_removed,on my ipad mini
jailbreak,not_removed,without a doubt i honestly regret ever upgrading
jailbreak,not_removed,on my iphone im on the beta 😞
jailbreak,not_removed,ios for that untethered
jailbreak,not_removed,ios on my iphone so i can get rid of the cancerous music app
jailbreak,not_removed,if i didnt have important data and an apple watch that would cease working i would totally go to
jailbreak,not_removed,ios on my iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,for now because everything is mostly compatible with this version i loved but many apps i use are and up 😔
jailbreak,not_removed,ios easy
jailbreak,not_removed,on my iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,on my ipad on my iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,ios or ios on my iphone or
jailbreak,not_removed,whenever the latest untethered jailbreak was i havent done a jailbreak since ios now waitin on the for my new
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone os on iphone and then sell for fortune d
jailbreak,not_removed,prolly on my id like pickpocket to be able to not be bypassed by a reboot and as most theives do t know about nonsubstrate mode it would work of the time
jailbreak,not_removed,or
jailbreak,not_removed,my ipad air would instant on ios maybe and my iphone on ios with fully untethered
jailbreak,not_removed,or maybe even
jailbreak,not_removed,putting every device on the original firmwares etc
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone iphone ipod touch
jailbreak,not_removed,the lastest firmware which can be jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,well if they do im already prepared i have installed ipsw ios i already have my blobs so im good there so when it happens ill try to get the blobs for them as quickly as possible 😎😎
jailbreak,not_removed,lol ios still cause i have watch os in a perfect world tho have a
jailbreak,not_removed,because of my lame superduper old skool bit device
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,the lastest firmware which can be jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,force ios on my will make this happen
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,the lastest firmware which can be jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,is this actually something that could happen when
jailbreak,not_removed,im pretty happy with my iphone on
jailbreak,not_removed,same versions that i want to downgrade
jailbreak,not_removed,does all apps from the app store install without complaining about the obsolete ios version
jailbreak,not_removed,we might be phone twins you struggling with the thought of jumping to ios i keep saying to myself why would you go to you are perfectly happy with your phone right now
jailbreak,not_removed,what was so great about ios didnt have an iphone until ios but i always see people talking about ios
jailbreak,not_removed,i agree my ipod touch was silky smooth on p
jailbreak,not_removed,ipod gen at the ready oh yeahdone
jailbreak,not_removed,agreed i just wish i could have the latest software on my apple watch though got a new series for my sis for christmas and i gotta say the new watchos is pretty smooth but as far as a jailbreak is by far the best one ive come across yet
jailbreak,not_removed,i was on prior to and finally was complete garbage but i personally like over simply because i like over was pretty stable with few issues which is why i believe people loved it so much
jailbreak,not_removed,it clearly says if it were down or backed up if they were down or backed up
jailbreak,not_removed,ios aint bad but is what this baby needs
jailbreak,not_removed,my has with coolbooter
jailbreak,not_removed,im on and want to downgrade to oh the irony just out of interest what apps dont work
jailbreak,not_removed,not sure what version youre on but have you tried apollo
jailbreak,not_removed,oh i need to update my flair i lost jb and then and now i am at
jailbreak,not_removed,oh i need to update my flair i lost jb and then and now i am at
jailbreak,not_removed,which tool do you use to save blobs
jailbreak,not_removed,go to ios
jailbreak,not_removed,why though thats like a super phone faster then my computer
jailbreak,not_removed,i have on my plus and its super smooth and fast but half of the apps are no longer supported
jailbreak,not_removed,nope sadly
jailbreak,not_removed,im not struggling that much the way i keep myself on is that there isnt even a signed jailbreak when was signed there wasnt a full jailbreak and the only choice right now is either way id have to deal with stock ios one way or another and i cant stand ios regardless
jailbreak,not_removed,because it was the smoothest ios we had and then changed everything
jailbreak,not_removed,the music app
jailbreak,not_removed,the whole post implies theyre down the only if is when op asks if they went back up implying theyre currently down
jailbreak,not_removed,basically all the new games closest i can remember mario run demands or higher a lot of apps for my city only dont get updates for ios anymore so im stuck with semiworking ones that are difficult to use due to new features that werent added in former versions i remember when i bought my phone in mid wps office offered to download latest supported version some socials like skype also do not update anymore but i dont know if they still work since i dont have anyone to chat with
jailbreak,not_removed,i am on and am using the music app with aria²
jailbreak,not_removed,the was released with ios
jailbreak,not_removed,resale value
jailbreak,not_removed,never say never certificates that sign firmwares are currently impenetrable but a there are quantum computers cooking and they can bruteforce an certificate in the matter of hours b apple headquarters are not as impenetrable as their certificates there might be a hero who will enter the facilities with physical access and steal them for us
jailbreak,not_removed,as a matter of fact this did happen thats why itll never happen again it was a mistake
jailbreak,not_removed,fuck them have the same device on ios and really want to downgrade to
jailbreak,not_removed,four of the main things keeping me off ios are no slide to unlock fucking stickers in imessage i mean what the actual fuck its ios not zuckerbergs bollocks for some reason the water pistol emoji annoys me too no slide to unlock maybe im just easily annoyed ps jailbroken iphone on
jailbreak,not_removed,most apps i use still support work with even ios so that wont be a problem but i am starting to think that this wont happen to be honest quite a good fantasy though
jailbreak,not_removed,o
jailbreak,not_removed,oh op said a bit after their servers are back up i thought he meant that something was happening nowsoon that could cause this
jailbreak,not_removed,give me and ill do some magic
jailbreak,not_removed,i really want to upgrade to like literally nothing is supported on ios now theres so many games i wanna get but they all require ios or higher the only benefit of ios is that my phone is super smooth and fast
jailbreak,not_removed,same reason here especially the water gun
jailbreak,not_removed,and no slide to unlock
jailbreak,not_removed,lucky i wish my was on so pickpocket couldnt be bypassed with a reboot and i very much doubt that te average theif would have the know how to boot into no sub mode to bypass pickpocket
jailbreak,not_removed,i only really have one reason theres just no legitimate feature i find appealing in anyway the white bubbles imo look less aesthetic the control seems less functional the os feels slower and the jailbreaks seemed messed up every feature on ios seems like a gimmick seriously watch the ios keynote where they talk about imessage the features are so dumb they sound like theyre joking
jailbreak,not_removed,same reason here especially the water gun
jailbreak,not_removed,what if apples secret police catch you
jailbreak,not_removed,why that is a kinda specific number
jailbreak,not_removed,what about replacing our devices it is iphone plus golden what is yours
jailbreak,not_removed,its called blend in like those guys that taped defected iphones to their skin to smuggle them out of the factory
jailbreak,not_removed,because bruno
jailbreak,not_removed,mine is only gb lool and silver
jailbreak,not_removed,i tought there isnt gb for iphone edit after see the edit ok its really not a problem for me
jailbreak,not_removed,im not joking i can replace it is not problem for me
jailbreak,not_removed,nope its a rich guy named bruno mars that has a song called magic
jailbreak,not_removed,if there isnt an ios jailbreak in a month or so im down to switch phones hows the condition of ur phone mine is pretty much brand new i put it in a speck case and applied a glass screen protector since day
jailbreak,not_removed,okey ill stay in touch i can send my phones photos edit how did you found ios on brand new iphone plus edit i bought it on april on joke day lol
jailbreak,not_removed,im not sure i only got my phone this summer and i was pretty surprised it was on too
jailbreak,not_removed,nice luck bro lol
jailbreak,not_removed,so where are you from
jailbreak,not_removed,lol yeah i was so surprised
jailbreak,not_removed,nyc hbu
jailbreak,not_removed,link is broken
jailbreak,not_removed,turkey izmir
jailbreak,not_removed,hmm weird it works for me try this
jailbreak,not_removed,oh if we do switch phones it will take forever to ship haha
jailbreak,not_removed,i see really lucky
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah lol
jailbreak,not_removed,this is a boot loop some get stuck on the logo and some shut off the jailbreak couldnt prevent your ipad from entering dfu mode so i dont know why you cant do that make sure your not confusing dfu mode with recovery look up a video on how to enter dfu if you are not completely sure
jailbreak,not_removed,what i was trying to say was that i tried entering dfu and recovery succeeded and then waited for it to time out to try booting again
jailbreak,not_removed,im pretty sure you are just gonna have to dfu restore
jailbreak,not_removed,i know just wanted to know what couldve caused such a thing since this is the first time ive ever encountered such a bootloop in the years ive been jailbreaking
jailbreak,not_removed,it seems something interrupted cydia as it was preparing the file system maybe your phone autolocked or something happened i cant be sure but youre only option might be to restore this happened on my due to the fact that i let it auto lock and i was forced to restore
jailbreak,not_removed,if you had filesystem access you might be able to do something but that would only be possible if you have openssh andor installed already
jailbreak,not_removed,semi restore
jailbreak,not_removed,try no substrate mode
jailbreak,not_removed,i went to concert
jailbreak,not_removed,you are going to concert
jailbreak,not_removed,i go to home
jailbreak,not_removed,i look at the stars
jailbreak,not_removed,you look at them
jailbreak,not_removed,yep no icons at all its due to cydia not arranging files properly try any one elses suggestion before restoring but im pretty sure you have to
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah unfortunately you need without it ifunbox will treat the device as jailed even though its jbd
jailbreak,not_removed,you may have to restore im sorry
jailbreak,not_removed,this should really work
jailbreak,not_removed,check for spelling errors and extra spaces in the url
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks this worked 😊
jailbreak,not_removed,thank god ive been waiting for these since i dont use spotify much needed tweak

jailbreak,not_removed,it is up now
jailbreak,not_removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
jailbreak,not_removed,does this work for both apple music and spotify

jailbreak,not_removed,you mean springtomize tomorrow tuesday 😏
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry for the confusion tuesday is the release date
jailbreak,not_removed,agreed but forecast is getting an upgrade
jailbreak,not_removed,one difference i know colorbanners will work well with appcon icons cheader right now doesnt
jailbreak,not_removed,it also include clean notification functions and works with every app icon
jailbreak,not_removed,it does can report as being one of the beta testers
jailbreak,not_removed,no not yet because spin color scheme is different from the dev confirmed he is working on it but not first priority
jailbreak,not_removed,defaulted to one day i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of

jailbreak,not_removed,doot doot
jailbreak,not_removed,ok not in the app i got it thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,does making my phone jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,just restore your device from the itunes backup if you happen to have the messages folder then if you were jailbroken you could just swap them out
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,how would you possibly do that
jailbreak,not_removed,hes quoting a part of your question that isnt worded well
jailbreak,not_removed,use a file manager to paste the old one in and delete the old one
jailbreak,not_removed,if my phone is jailbroken does it make it someway easier to restore texts from a itunes backup
jailbreak,not_removed,is there a link or tutorial for this
jailbreak,not_removed,i want to say ibackupbot wouldshould allow this httpwwwicopybotcomitunesbackupmanagerhtm
jailbreak,not_removed,um no im guessing you dont have the messages file anyway so it doesnt matter
jailbreak,not_removed,you have to pay
jailbreak,not_removed,that sucks i figured there may be a trial or a lite version
jailbreak,not_removed,banner sounds change sounds and vibration patterns for notifications based on filters matching an application andor notification title andor notification subtitle andor notification message httptateunetrepo
jailbreak,not_removed,youre phone is done you cant downgrade
jailbreak,not_removed,cheers mate
jailbreak,not_removed,not yet anyway there may be a method sometime in december read up on prometheus if you have old blobs keep them you may be stuck with ios for now but the future may be bright
jailbreak,not_removed,remove the biteyourapple repo from sources
jailbreak,not_removed,bya does that
jailbreak,not_removed,how did you get bars instead of dots repo

jailbreak,not_removed,immediately entitled much
jailbreak,not_removed,immediately 👏🏻😂
jailbreak,not_removed,hardreboot your iphone and rejailbreak using the yalu app
jailbreak,not_removed,disable every tweak except kaze with icleaner does it still happen
jailbreak,not_removed,yea why
jailbreak,not_removed,still same after rejailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,super rude you really think youre more likely to get what you want making rude demands or being polite particularly with a free product i definitely cant understand how someone could think its ok to be like that
jailbreak,not_removed,hmm see if reinstalling the tweak fixes the issue if it doesnt then i think you will have to remove it i use kaze and im not experiencing any issues
jailbreak,not_removed,yea ive also reinstall it but the same bug there what iphone u use
jailbreak,not_removed,i have an iphone plus jailbroken on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,revoke cert
jailbreak,not_removed,this is the post
jailbreak,not_removed,hello thank you for your participation in rjailbreak however your submission was removed for the following reasons this is already answered on the which is this is already answered on the httpswwwredditcomrjailbreakwikifaq if you have any questions about this removal please feel free to
jailbreak,not_removed,may need to revoke any signed certificates in the xcode tab of impactor
jailbreak,not_removed,im from the azores and currently jail broken
jailbreak,not_removed,lol since no one replied im from us youre on your own buddy 😬👍
jailbreak,not_removed,almost forever alone
jailbreak,not_removed,everything is fake until a tool is released i dont trust anyone anymore
jailbreak,not_removed,alright then thanks for remainding me why i retired from this community
jailbreak,not_removed,ive removed this post because although you want to stay on for a jailbreak its not really a jailbreak related question due to the fact nobody knows which ios will be jailbroken first you also need a developer account to legally get the profile so other methods are not allowed here
jailbreak,not_removed,ios jailbreak links httpenpanguioipadkid all of these are the same pangu jailbreak and the official versions directions for version without computer press on install on the popup go to home screen you will see the app is loading once it switches to installing turn on airplane mode this happens quickly please be paying attention stay in airplane mode and do not turn on wifi until the app is fully downloaded it shouldnt take long after that go to settings ➡️ general ➡️ profiles device management ➡️ beijing profile if you havent yet turn wifi back on trust the developer notes regarding each version the chinese versions install a pirate app store and can be removed in cydia you can also uncheck the box the first time you run the app to prevent the installation of the pirate app store the english version requires you to check the box to get the april certificate the first time you run the app created for rjailbreak by uipadkid feel free to copy this post but please give credit
jailbreak,not_removed,testing right now keep the links coming if you have any others
jailbreak,not_removed,no unfortunately not there used to be another one but it was against sub rules and the sites been taken down completely now i think you were just missing the middle section there about directions for version without computer
jailbreak,not_removed,happens to me too
jailbreak,not_removed,same here so i just ended up deleting all my tweaks and started fresh and that worked for me
jailbreak,not_removed,can u tell me step by step deleting all tweaks and fresh installed ph first bcause ive same problem with priority hub beta
jailbreak,not_removed,omfg it worked i started to get worried thanks a lot man
jailbreak,not_removed,oh is the tool working again
jailbreak,not_removed,it never stopped working it was all bullshit
jailbreak,not_removed,did you get it to work to upgradedowngrade i am still stuck on baseband error
jailbreak,not_removed,no it did stop working something got messed up just not tss servers going down theres a fix being worked on right now
jailbreak,not_removed,dude have you read his twitter
jailbreak,not_removed,yea he said that the tss server didnt go down
jailbreak,not_removed,is this better than displayrecorder
jailbreak,not_removed,can someone put this in a repo please
jailbreak,not_removed,does it record system audio
jailbreak,not_removed,on my device it shows iphone and iphone speaker in airplay menu no irec option
jailbreak,not_removed,works on iphone edit i followed the steps on the website use cydia impactor to sign the ipa file onto your device then trust the certificate
jailbreak,not_removed,what is a soft launch
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,do we need anything else after that cuz like most people when i clikc air play in the end it only shows iphone and iphone speaker
jailbreak,not_removed,so when are you gonna fix the irec not showing in airplay
jailbreak,not_removed,cant find the irec airplay option in my cceverything else went well im running ios iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,hell yeah
jailbreak,not_removed,exciting works good it appears to not record landscape correctly plus theres the stupid impactor certificate
jailbreak,not_removed,hi fromderik i have to be missing something here i cant see any links to download this do i need to be logged in i need to be registered where do you see this link in cydia web browser on your iphone pc thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,ive been using shou will switch if people think this is better
jailbreak,not_removed,im actually also having problems with this app when i go to airplay options i dont see irec which is weird i think this is considered a softlaunch because it isnt ready yet i will update you guys when a new update for this comes out
jailbreak,not_removed,did anyone fix the irec not showing in the airplay options
jailbreak,not_removed,the app crashes on ipad mini
jailbreak,not_removed,its crashing when i open it iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,ios
jailbreak,not_removed,if you sideload it using cydia impactor dont you have to resign it every days
jailbreak,not_removed,i cannot see the airplay icon on control center
jailbreak,not_removed,installing with filza failedafter installing appsync unified now i can show icon in home screen but cant open it crashes
jailbreak,not_removed,guys how can i grab the ipa file from the repo i added the repo into cydia but im assuming it shouldnt be installed that way and should be installed via impactor im just not sure how to get the ipa file
jailbreak,not_removed,crashing at launch iphone and i trusted the certificate
jailbreak,not_removed,now what makes this better than display recorder
jailbreak,not_removed,remindme hours
jailbreak,not_removed,what is the difference with display recorder just to compare since display recorder crash some of my apps
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for the post we just rolled out an update for the app fixing a few bugs we also allow you to record in game audio get it at our site
jailbreak,not_removed,guys im an idiot i never saw the website part thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work for me
jailbreak,not_removed,why wasnt this released in cydia as a tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,can this work on non jailbroken devices in the website it says it can work on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,this crashes for me iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,imo nothing is better than display recorder it records at full speed any orientation recording modes adjustable video formats and quality and can record mic audio even if irec really does record system audio it is still not better
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,okay i will give me an hour
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah it should httpiimgurcomdcnndjypng just like vidyo did pulled from appstore guess it has something to do how airplay works or something
jailbreak,not_removed,unless im mistaken theres no tweak that can record your device screen with system audio most tweaks only record mic audio
jailbreak,not_removed,display recorder is able to do this but only with certain apps for example i am able to record gaming audio as well as mic audio at the same time
jailbreak,not_removed,same here
jailbreak,not_removed,it happens to me too there is no option for irec on airplay
jailbreak,not_removed,same
jailbreak,not_removed,same it worked yesterday but now i cant use it
jailbreak,not_removed,same here any idea how to fix this
jailbreak,not_removed,same here followed all the steps
jailbreak,not_removed,same
jailbreak,not_removed,you have to install it through your computer
jailbreak,not_removed,read the website all is there
jailbreak,not_removed,did you start the recording with airdrop also did you trust irec in the settings
jailbreak,not_removed,i think appsync should take care of it
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,click on the link at the top there will be links to download the ipa
jailbreak,not_removed,the fact that it seems free
jailbreak,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of hours to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
jailbreak,not_removed,display recorder does not record system audio and mic this does
jailbreak,not_removed,still only iphone and iphone speaker available at airplay
jailbreak,not_removed,game only not videos
jailbreak,not_removed,do you just overwrite the ipa in the process cuz i think i updated it but still no irec in the airplay section
jailbreak,not_removed,did you start the recording with airdrop also did you trust irec in the settings
jailbreak,not_removed,despite the fact that theres a big green line going down the right off my screen whenever i record
jailbreak,not_removed,what about bbrec
jailbreak,not_removed,did you put it in
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks mate
jailbreak,not_removed,times up
jailbreak,not_removed,vidyo is the best ive never heard of it i could find it and install it from im in love thank you for the tip
jailbreak,not_removed,vidyoappstore could do
jailbreak,not_removed,audiorecorder can record system audio
jailbreak,not_removed,is anything that you have modified installedremovedchanged since yesterday
jailbreak,not_removed,whats the point of that
jailbreak,not_removed,oh okay nice
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackagecomtushaoyeairplayenabler bigboss free tweaks controlcenter always shows airplay button bleep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,ohgreat
jailbreak,not_removed,i have the same problem ios
jailbreak,not_removed,guess updating should do it but just in case i deleted the first install downloaded again and installed new downloaded file no dice
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont see that option in settings i installed it using appcake
jailbreak,not_removed,this using ios on a iphone and everything comes out with a one pixel big green line going down to the right of my screen its only on the recording
jailbreak,not_removed,screenshot which device are you using a cracked version
jailbreak,not_removed,hmm thats odd i have a friend on a ill ask him to test dr out if it happens on all devices its a problem with the tweak otherwise its an individual your issue did you set the framerate slider to maximum and locked it also set mode to precalculated
jailbreak,not_removed,i have put in my repo thecydiayourepocom it is installing correctly without any error but app is not showing on homescreen just checking again whats happening
jailbreak,not_removed,ah well
jailbreak,not_removed,thats version not this one buddy this is version
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone and no
jailbreak,not_removed,let us know how you go please
jailbreak,not_removed,but i downloaded version im sure of it i downloaded the one that was for ios
jailbreak,not_removed,it might be because of the resolution try littlebrotherupscale and lower the resolution if the green line doesnt show up its a problem if it bothers you use irec display recorder works fine with other devices
jailbreak,not_removed,i think there is problem with ipa file thats why he have added soft release and mentioned can be install only with cydia impactor other thing it require certificate verification
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,answered your own question didnt you
jailbreak,not_removed,hahahhahaha take this l
jailbreak,not_removed,their jb is from everything in between p
jailbreak,not_removed,it depends on what you were installing i believe
jailbreak,not_removed,we got a pirate over here p
jailbreak,not_removed,how are we supposed to help if we cant see what is going on leading up to the problem
jailbreak,not_removed,it would help if youd show us the tweak you are installing because it could be one of things
jailbreak,not_removed,the cydo error means you need coolstars stashing tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,he probably tried to pirate something and doesnt want people to know
jailbreak,not_removed,i can guarantee it thats why he hid it like that
jailbreak,not_removed,my thoughts as well
jailbreak,not_removed,widget keeps crashing every now and then done a semi restore with cydia eraser before two days and it was there before i guess and now it followed me
jailbreak,not_removed,no theres no main suspect and i also tried disabling all substrate add ons using icleaner pro
jailbreak,not_removed,crash reporter tell you what cause this see if there is a main supsect and look on syslog
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks fixed it on my own now just ran icleaner
jailbreak,not_removed,only way i have found to mirror is the hdmi adapter i use it all the time well worth the money however i wish i could use mirracast like android does you can mirror using the youtube app too with no adapter
jailbreak,not_removed,yes it mirrors everything
jailbreak,not_removed,no jailbreak required
jailbreak,not_removed,you can install reflector and mirror the display wirelessly
jailbreak,not_removed,does the hdmi cable mirror the phone completely in any app or does this require a cydia tweak to get to work or does the hdmi just work the same as airplay
jailbreak,not_removed,sweet ill give it a go
jailbreak,not_removed,how does this do it wirelessly does reflector need installed on the smart box as well
jailbreak,not_removed,reflector is a receiver its available for android windows and mac
jailbreak,not_removed,mywi does that great app but dont think its been updated yet when it is that is exactly what your looking for
jailbreak,not_removed,no
jailbreak,not_removed,is this serious
jailbreak,not_removed,works as the same thing nothings different apple didnt catch it because theyre fucking dumb
jailbreak,not_removed,actually theres a lot of things that are different about the app the app is an incredibly obfuscated package they entirely obfuscated the entire machohid everything that it does outside of plaintextplain symbols secondly it doesnt actually have any jailbreak data on it to begin with the spinning circle is the device downloading the appropriate data to jailbreak your phone with so yes it is very different and no malware as far as i can tell
jailbreak,not_removed,i had a good laugh 😂😂 but you broke rule
jailbreak,not_removed,it sounds dumb but when that happened to my ipad i fixed it by changing to another language going to appstore then changing language back no idea why thatd ever work i googled and found someone suggested back when this happened to me no idea if itll help you but good luck
jailbreak,not_removed,youve downloaded apps using two different ids when you restore from backup after the restore those apps get put back on your phone you can delete all the ios apps saved in itunes on your computer then delete the two pending updates on your phone download those two apps using your own apple id sync another option is to do the above but then create a family share if you need to download the apps from your dads account instead of the last part where you download them with your account source i help people with this alot
jailbreak,not_removed,have you tried settings itunes app store tap your apple id at top and sign out im looking at this on my device dont have one on handy for reference then sign back in and see if that helps
jailbreak,not_removed,having the exact same issue thought i was going crazy ive tried next to everything short of a restore with no luck
jailbreak,not_removed,can you login with you icloud account online
jailbreak,not_removed,did you recently repair your screen
jailbreak,not_removed,no shit this actually worked for me changed to uk english went into app store hit update asked for password entered it and download started thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you dude youre the best
jailbreak,not_removed,he whats up basically my iphone restarted and now the problem is reoccurring and the language changing trick is not working and ideas
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks man i have no idea why but it worked 🎉
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks but the language thing worked if it comes back ill use your advice
jailbreak,not_removed,ive tried that i usually log into my fathers account do a few things and its fine but recently it hasnt fingers crossed for jb
jailbreak,not_removed,in restrictions under passwords it doesnt allow me to change amount of time required for password when i would sometimes have a small fix it would ask me that and then i knew it was fixed
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,no same way i got it
jailbreak,not_removed,that should only affect touch id not the actual passcode
jailbreak,not_removed,smart i can update there as i have updates and its bugging the crap out of me the password pop ups mainly in the music app ill have to deal with till i can update and rejailbreak thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,nope issue never came back for me good luck
jailbreak,not_removed,awesome i didnt see that solution and now i must know why it works glad youre good
jailbreak,not_removed,so you got nothing lol
jailbreak,not_removed,you could also update the apps with veeshare too next time if u do t have a jailbroken device but are in a lower firmware like me on
jailbreak,not_removed,you can actually run semirestore to fix that
jailbreak,not_removed,ive tried signing out of everything including facetime hard resetting resetting all settings reset network settings spent at least hours total on the phone with apple support and theyre stumped also its been an off and on issue thats been driving me insane for a couple months it went away for sometime when i found that i had two pending downloads in the itunes app but its apparently come back and i cant update apps now really dont want to restore and lose my jailbreak even if i only really use it for phantom now
jailbreak,not_removed,delete substrate but remove it from the queue while it is deleting and all the tweaks will be queued to remove
jailbreak,not_removed,httpssemirestorecom
jailbreak,not_removed,remove cydia substrate
jailbreak,not_removed,this could be a good idea actually are we sure im not going to fuck up
jailbreak,not_removed,op is on semirestore supports ios
jailbreak,not_removed,it should be fine people do it all the time most of the post about this actually recommend straight up deleting substrate i dont like how that sound lol
jailbreak,not_removed,hey so im about to do this but how do i remove cydia substrate from the queue after selecting everything if i tap clear i can still see substrate in the queue
jailbreak,not_removed,you are just supposed to queue substrate and then remove it i havent tried it personally but others say it works pretty well
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i have no idea tbh heres what i do go to cydia substrate modify remove on the window that pops up i tap continue queuing how do i remove substrate from the tweaks to remove while keeping all the others selecting clear doesnt do anything the only option left is cancel on the top left but thatd remove everything in the remove queue lol im confused xd
jailbreak,not_removed,alright took a leap of faith and deleted the whole thing cydia substrate included all the tweaks are gone except a few all good finally i can start off clean and try not to clutter my phone as it was before thanks guys

jailbreak,not_removed,boi its on a repo no need to go through ifile and shit
jailbreak,not_removed,rlegacyjailbreak is a lot of help on ios and below you should check it outask there
jailbreak,not_removed,automod just answered your question
jailbreak,not_removed,or
jailbreak,not_removed,what is the difference between the two
jailbreak,not_removed,ive used both extensively while i started with phantom and am now using snap i can say that i would definitely recommend snap because they do pretty much all of the same things with a couple smaller differences snap feels polished and complete while phantom has ads and feels more raw both work perfectly fine tbh
jailbreak,not_removed,not much ive used both extensively and happen to prefer snap but its just preference
jailbreak,not_removed,snap doesnt block a live snap lol is there anyway block or delete it
jailbreak,not_removed,activator endless ways to use
jailbreak,not_removed,the untether rip untether i cant recall at which point it was a package in cydia maybe ios
jailbreak,not_removed,same happened to me lost my profile too had to rejailbreak with the us version impactor lost my sons ipad trying to figure it out got stuck in a boot loop had to update sucks be carefull
jailbreak,not_removed,if it starts with pp then it doesnt show up for me
jailbreak,not_removed,call fbi they can
jailbreak,not_removed,you dont have touch id
jailbreak,not_removed,if you dont have ssh installed or openfile thing then there is no way at all and even if you do have it i dont know how as i never get ssh cause i dont need it
jailbreak,not_removed,hard reset hold the home and sleep button your phone and see if your old passcode works in normal mode
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks all for your advice currently restoring it with itunes as we speak here i come bye jailbreak ill miss you
jailbreak,not_removed,i always use touch id but it wont let me use it and says i have to enter the passcode
jailbreak,not_removed,same thing happened to me on
jailbreak,not_removed,try deleting the preference file using icleaner
jailbreak,not_removed,how do i do that dont see that in icleaner
jailbreak,not_removed,preferences files in the tab
jailbreak,not_removed,its not an option isnt there a repo just for icleaner im using off the big boss repo
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah the probeta repo is
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks got it working
jailbreak,not_removed,try a hard reset then boot back upthen try the pangu app againitll work eventuallyalso i found that if i wasnt connected to wifidata it rarely workedbut as long as the app is still certifiedit should workon my jb i once spent near a whole day trying the app to rejailbreakits not a everytime

jailbreak,not_removed,start a fresh jailbreak so use oxrestore
jailbreak,not_removed,can be found on repo it prevents crashingreboots hope it helps you
jailbreak,not_removed,dont blobs are useless since apple patched it early this year only works for iphone and then since the method was completely patched all together and prevents u from downgrading to even thought it was signed so its a one way ticket for waiting for an ios jailbreak jailbreak is worth staying with even without it being activated as long as u remain on a jail breakable firmware
jailbreak,not_removed,scrible now supports spanish d
jailbreak,not_removed,ive done it before lol but for a minor jb some stuff still makes it slow etc i love jb since the first one came out but idk haha i just feel that apple is making it harder to develop a jb and use one

jailbreak,not_removed,do you live under a rock have you heard of futurerestoreprometheus
jailbreak,not_removed,jailbreak exploits and apples model is basically simplicity and security so its understandable why apple vs jailbreak collide
jailbreak,not_removed,um no sir i do not live under a rock these tools only work with iphone because its the only device which have enough nonce collisions to downgrade also these tools has been patched since soooo blobs were basically useless due to the narrow amount of devices which were supported and now they completely useless cause it doesnt work anymore on new versions and will be flushed out soon
jailbreak,not_removed,no nonce collisions were patched in and thats not the only way to downgrade you can downgrade using a patcher that allows you to set your nonce in the nvram but that requires a jailbreak with you saying blobs are useless is wrong because obviously using a jailbreak to set your nonce and use futureresrore would work and allow you to downgrade
jailbreak,not_removed,i thought the newer versions fucked up the touch id o
jailbreak,not_removed,yea ur right they were patched in but actually still works the whole purpose of ops post was he wants to go to and save his blobs so that he can return to it later if he made a bad choice upgrading what i was trying to tell him thats useless
jailbreak,not_removed,depends on whether or not the baseband i think its called is compatible
jailbreak,not_removed,the baseband handles the cellular capability only cellular devices have it the thing on board the device that handles touch id is called the secure enclave processor the secure enclave processor also known as the sep handles all touch id requests fingerprints are stored in the sep in to the sep firmware was different and incompatible with each other you are forced to use the latest signed sep firmware as tsschecker does not save sep and baseband tickets to be used for restoring the sep firmware from to is compatible with one another there are many posts on the sub to tell you i think i spent way too much time typing this
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah hella people have been asking and trying to use it on their after he posted that
jailbreak,not_removed,he does says iphone is not supported during the vid
jailbreak,not_removed,he clearly says the seven only works on
jailbreak,not_removed,many peoples are getting mad bc he put final in his topic lol i am laughing so hard when reading those commend
jailbreak,not_removed,hilarious its awesome to get all my information from youtube how simple life is s
jailbreak,not_removed,hes better than icu thats for sure some other great youtubes i watch for jb vids are idevicehelp and thehackspot
jailbreak,not_removed,why would you even watch these videos when luca has clearly stated everything on his twitter
jailbreak,not_removed,he said in the video that its not supported for iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,he only did this so he woudnt have to make a video every time a beta comes out
jailbreak,not_removed,at in the video he says the only requirements are that you guys are on or hes confusing his viewers lol just pointing that out
jailbreak,not_removed,the video implies that the latest yalu beta made for will work on running ios
jailbreak,not_removed,me too thats why i posted it some people here dont seem to get that
jailbreak,not_removed,entertainment reading the comments with all the confused viewers on running
jailbreak,not_removed,ya not a good reason when you have million subscribers who have no idea what theyre doing lol
jailbreak,not_removed,just look at luca twitter and the github where yula is posted with all the legit information regarding the jailbreak he even said dont trust you tubers and untrustworthy ipas but people still dont listen or better yet act like they cant read
jailbreak,not_removed,just listen later in the vid
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i just commended on his video and idk if he notices it lol
jailbreak,not_removed,its a problem with toms repo nothing you can do to fix it just wait
jailbreak,not_removed,respring then wait if it still says that worked for me
jailbreak,not_removed,€ thats pretty cheap for the top best ifile manager
jailbreak,not_removed,why how many you using
jailbreak,not_removed,if youre worried it wont then just copy your patchesplist and put it in a dropbox or something so you can replace it after you rejailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,like
jailbreak,not_removed,get then find the folder copy it varmobiledocumentsflex just checked myself

jailbreak,not_removed,no worries
jailbreak,not_removed,musixmatch is app
jailbreak,not_removed,you can add httpsmoshedgithubio and download lyrics package itll probbaly keep on saying that you have an update though i cant figure out how to fix that or just download from httpsmeganz but make sure you download all the dependencies lynx coreutils nettateusendtestbulletin netangelxwindmikoto make a custom activator action with the command lyrics enable the full notification setting in mikoto and make sure notifications are enabled for whatever app you want to get lyrics for
jailbreak,not_removed,this song 😂❤️ i really get turnt to this
jailbreak,not_removed,cant believe all the comments over a song do all you guys who disagree with his taste listen to country or metal im confused
jailbreak,not_removed,the fact that music like this is popular makes me fear for the future of humanity
jailbreak,not_removed,young thug alone made me upvote this
jailbreak,not_removed,oh look its every rap song from the past years
jailbreak,not_removed,this music will turn you into a psychotic please go to a therapist asap
jailbreak,not_removed,til the definition of airhead
jailbreak,not_removed,could have picked a better song👎🏼👎🏼
jailbreak,not_removed,hey why dont you make a scoot that spits the lyrics into an html file that can be displayed on the locks teen with something like lockhtml also try updating your package to and pushing to see if it resolves update loop
jailbreak,not_removed,do you really like to turnip
jailbreak,not_removed,i didnt realize how unwavy rjailbreak was
jailbreak,not_removed,riamverysmart
jailbreak,not_removed,many other things should make you fear for the future of humanity besides some random persons taste in music
jailbreak,not_removed,rlewronggeneration
jailbreak,not_removed,oh my golly these kids with their music taste that isnt the same as mine humanity is doomed
jailbreak,not_removed,go outside sometime
jailbreak,not_removed,lmao youre pathetic
jailbreak,not_removed,im glad you can tell the music quality and sounds from just reading the lyrics impressive
jailbreak,not_removed,yes those lyrics are awful
jailbreak,not_removed,the song is a relaxed banger its not meant to be intelligent listen to the song maybe
jailbreak,not_removed,listen to the song before you start talking shit
jailbreak,not_removed,httpmimgurcomuyihiner
jailbreak,not_removed,jeffrey goat
jailbreak,not_removed,are you sure about that
jailbreak,not_removed,hmm thats a smart idea but i dont relly know how lockhtml works and html in general works maybe ill play around with it interesting thing is in my testing i took different packages one from your repo and one from another repo and copied the text they had in the packages file and using that format filled out the info by hand for my own files with the proper info the files i took for the other repos work perfectly while my own are stuck in an update loop cant figure it out
jailbreak,not_removed,im like super wavy
jailbreak,not_removed,the first words of these lyrics say everything you need to know about the quality of this song
jailbreak,not_removed,it doesnt mean that it should be a diarrhea like this one
jailbreak,not_removed,i think this is gonna go over a lot of peoples heads
jailbreak,not_removed,this is gold im saving this
jailbreak,not_removed,but its not the truth theres a lot of good diverse rap music to be listened to if youre willing to look for it a lot of artists dont get the attention they deserve
jailbreak,not_removed,ikr wtf
jailbreak,not_removed,html isnt too hard you could figured it out i took your lyrics deb and changed control to version and it fixed it for me
jailbreak,not_removed,sometimes its about the lyrics sometimes its about the beats im not a fan of thugga but i aint gonna hate on thugga
jailbreak,not_removed,i can agree with that im more or less disappointed in todays the best beats lyrics used to be together now its good beats with garbage lyrics and good lyrics on more chill beats bitches gats homicide pimping and blunts make up the majority of rap songs now a days and the youth eat it up which isnt good when your reciting banging hoes at a young age and see the rappers living the life then youre more apt to find that type of behavior acceptable just my cents though theres still some ogs out there like nas
jailbreak,not_removed,changing the control file to stops the upgrade loop but only if i dont upgrade the packages file to reflect that which then results in it not knowing the package is installed from giving me the package installed unknownlocal source
jailbreak,not_removed,alright ill try that and get back to you
jailbreak,not_removed,imagine being this closedminded
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah its all good i just was annoyed because the imo was missing
jailbreak,not_removed,but thats not even what you said
jailbreak,not_removed,theres still some ogs out there like nas ok buddy picked the mac up told brothers back up the mac spit lead was hittin niggas one ran – i made him backflip guess who said that nas rapped about all that stuff you say is making up the majority of rap songs
jailbreak,not_removed,well i see your point about the questionable lyrics and it being more acceptable to a millennial but i only really listen to artists like young thug for the beat the vibes if you will when i want to listen to lyrics i listen to hopsin tech etc i also listen to rock but thats not really related thanks for being civil

jailbreak,not_removed,it does
jailbreak,not_removed,only in jailbroken state
jailbreak,not_removed,anything that uses substrate is only usable in jbn mode kind of a no brainer
jailbreak,not_removed,agreed thats why the true and only way to prevent it entirely is downloading the tv os beta profile that protects all of the time
jailbreak,not_removed,none that im aware of that work anyway if youre wanting to be able to receive a reply and continue to mess with them you can try from the app store it gives you a free local number and unlimited texts for free or you can email their phone number set up a fake email and find their carrier gateway httpmfitzpiolistofemailtosmsgateways for example to email a text to a verizon customers phone youd email theirphonenumbervtextcom this email will show up on their phone just like a text message from another phone would and they can still reply but its a little more work to reply than just texting back and forth
jailbreak,not_removed,this doesnt necessarily fakev texts but you can spam someone like messages in less than a minute with a single button

jailbreak,not_removed,i know they was associated with pangu but according to jailwiki they released there own jailbreaks if i remember right wasnt they funding pangu so they could benefit from it with there piracy store just wondering if anyone knows where they went or if they plan to develop again
jailbreak,not_removed,i talked to one of the representatives the other day supposedly i couldnt confirm this and he was really nice but only answered some of my questions and he mentioned something about pangu i had to use google translate and it didnt make sense maybe pangu was more successful without pp i really think they are nobody used the pp app after jailbreaking come on im actually quite surprised they even made a tool
jailbreak,not_removed,theyre busy working on an ios jailbreak s
jailbreak,not_removed,the pp jailbreak was the pangu jailbreak but they made it available to mac users i believe they were not to happy about them rebranding the jailbreak as their own though
jailbreak,not_removed,pretty sure the pp jailbreak took taig jailbreak and updated it
jailbreak,not_removed,bang on the taig site still has a post about it
jailbreak,not_removed,ahh yeah sorry its been so long i knew they took it from someone though
jailbreak,not_removed,ok i thought so i have no idea why i got downvoted by some one lol
jailbreak,not_removed,lol really has been so long yet it only feels like yesterday to me
jailbreak,not_removed,they think jb teams would get upset by your post and stop delivering their tools kids you know never mind ive up voted it back
jailbreak,not_removed,lol thx man

jailbreak,not_removed,yeah there is some tweak which is not functioning properly if you have icleaner installed you can check by disabling the tweaks and respring it will work fine then
jailbreak,not_removed,mail to the creator of touchr at
jailbreak,not_removed,you still have to press the home button to unlock or is there an option to in touchr for this
jailbreak,not_removed,theres an option in default settings app iirc in accessibility that let you unlock using only touch id without pressing another time
jailbreak,not_removed,i feel so stupid for posting that comment now
jailbreak,not_removed,no
jailbreak,not_removed,many people wish that
jailbreak,not_removed,hello thank you for your participation in rjailbreak however your submission was removed for the following reasons this is already answered on the httpswwwredditcomrjailbreakwikifaq if you have any questions about this removal please feel free to
jailbreak,not_removed,most of my web downloads go to varmobiledocuments
jailbreak,not_removed,i came to say the guy is correct ubeezure always goes to varmobiledocuments book mark that section when you get to it itll definitely come in handy if you browseuse ifile often like me
jailbreak,not_removed,when i cant find a file i connect my device to ifun box and search for the file using the search feature one just needs to get at least part of the file name right then hit search you should be able to trace the containing folder from the search result
jailbreak,not_removed,try using a party downloader from the appstore then go to its documents in the applications folder and it should be there if that doesent work then the file your downloading may be corrupted
jailbreak,not_removed,thats what i thought well that and the downloads folder but unfortunately i cant find the file in either of those it doesnt make any sense since like mentioned in the op ive downloaded it twice and the storage capacity lessened so it has to be around somewhere
jailbreak,not_removed,cant find the file in there unfortunately thats the only thing i needed ifile for
jailbreak,not_removed,try searching the file name from top of hierarchy in ifile and see if it turns up that way
jailbreak,not_removed,thats weird was it using safari downloader
jailbreak,not_removed,i think so its been a while since i tried it and now i cant even find the file i was trying to download online anymore i got what i wanted otherwise though so its alright thanks for trying to help man appreciate it
jailbreak,not_removed,anytime bud
jailbreak,not_removed,on safari hold the bookmarks icon down a popup will appear and you can save the file using that
jailbreak,not_removed,on safari hold the bookmarks icon down a popup will appear and you can save the file using that
jailbreak,not_removed,found airspeaker on angelxwind works great
jailbreak,not_removed,you can try lockglyph it uses an animation and the animation is pretty slow so you can just take your finger off before it finishes and your phone wont unlock
jailbreak,not_removed,a free tweak that works very well is to press the button and remove your finger faster press the button and get your god damn finger off of it pretend its a hot stove burner touch it and back the fuck away quickly or use the power button hope this helps
jailbreak,not_removed,i just use my fingernail when i dont want to unlock it very simple
jailbreak,not_removed,already tried that it will still unlock even a split second of finger on the touch id
jailbreak,not_removed,lol your first suggestion could end up my phone falling backwards from my palm if you know how most people hold an iphone second suggestion nah the button is a little too far to reach
jailbreak,not_removed,fair enough lol
jailbreak,not_removed,springtomise does this if i recall correctly
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i was hoping for an alternative as springtomise seriously bogs down my phone and takes up space
jailbreak,not_removed,the apple logo appears for about a minute and then it turns off if the screen doesnt turn blue or similarly weird colour and it happens relatively quickly its likely due to bitrot the nand is probably holding corrupted data may be unrelated w the full storage although its probably more likely to encounter such issues on a full drive could be due to any number of reasons from software failure to cosmic rays
jailbreak,not_removed,did you try booting into no substrate mode holding volume up while booting
jailbreak,not_removed,can you go into dfu mode does your screen show funny colors i had to swap iphone because of that bootloop and wasnt ablento restore etc was jailbroken on the second wasnt on so it doesnt have to be caused by your jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,where you full on your main storage partition or the partition for tweaks and cydia if so you might have to find a way to remove a tweak it teo
jailbreak,not_removed,the suns radiation killed my iphone god damn you sun god damn you to hell
jailbreak,not_removed,yea and nothing happens ive used it before but it didnt work this time
jailbreak,not_removed,did you try holding only the volume up button on boot
jailbreak,not_removed,thats how i always do it and nothing ive never heard of this happening ive googled and gone through other forums and nothing i really dont want to lose my jailbreak specially since im waiting till till the drops to get a new phone months with no jailbreak would really suck
jailbreak,not_removed,well dang that really sucks wish i knew of another way to help you
jailbreak,not_removed,its now it a boot loop only a dfu restore can solve it but itll still be icloud locked so thief cant use it
jailbreak,not_removed,your ipad is now a paperwight good for parts until you get it back and even fr parts the best part the motherboard is useless its only good for the housing the screen the speakers and buttons etc
jailbreak,not_removed,lol asked if a jailbreak kills the remote deletion feature doh i like when people are answering a question by not answeringcompletly ignoring it
jailbreak,not_removed,not true all you have to do is restore it
jailbreak,not_removed,which is exactly what you are doing my friend on topic it does not kill the remote wipe feature and the thief cannot access the ipad now if you had a passcode or icloud lock on
jailbreak,not_removed,and you are greeted with icloud activation upon restore makes device useless to thieves and he is correct
jailbreak,not_removed,ya but it will be icloud locked still
jailbreak,not_removed,im not showing of by stating something that wasnt even asked by the poster why shouldnd i post a critique if the others are giving answers to a non asked question
jailbreak,not_removed,useless to thieves not useless to the owner
jailbreak,not_removed,he said until you the owner gets it back re read the comment
jailbreak,not_removed,o
jailbreak,not_removed,its just visual tinder hackstweaks dont really do much tinder is all serverside stuff
jailbreak,not_removed,apps that offer unlimited swipes or super likes dont work anything else like autoswipe and stuff does
jailbreak,not_removed,i posted these here because its a tweak related issue the tweak picks and chooses which theme to accept some dont work at all hence the post to jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,deleted
jailbreak,not_removed,does this happen when your phone is connected to a charger cable
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah this has been happening to me as well good thing i have asphaleia app security tweak installed as it then asks for my thumbprint so then itunes doesnt actually fully launch
jailbreak,not_removed,no it never happened when my ipad was connected to pccharger
jailbreak,not_removed,i think this might be crashreporter misidentifying the culprit im sure noctis doesnt even hook into reddit so it isnt that
jailbreak,not_removed,as you guys seen in above is there any solutions of this error in noctis i used the paid and last version of it tried to uninstalled and clean it using ic then reinstall but theres nothing changed and still have the error did you guys had an idea thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,unfortunately id clean the crash logs my notifs mate it happens not only in reddit even in the other apps sometimes i also got crashed and crashreporter says noctisdylib is the main suspect no idea why but previously it runs well last night it starts happened and i havent installed any tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,do you have night mode on reddit if so it may be conflicting with the tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,did you download universal video downloader
jailbreak,not_removed,how do you get noctis that dark
jailbreak,not_removed,what font is that
jailbreak,not_removed,this is makes sense now i set the nightmode on reddit will try to turn it off thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i do but id deleted it already is it conflict with each other too
jailbreak,not_removed,which one the notification banners or the background id mix with hidemex tho
jailbreak,not_removed,merge light
jailbreak,not_removed,the banners
jailbreak,not_removed,ive had it installed for quite a while and i dont remember being redirected since then or maybe im just oblivious are you sure it doesnt work
jailbreak,not_removed,try ios untrusted hosts blocker
jailbreak,not_removed,i would contact the developer of that tweak and see if theyre planning on updating it
jailbreak,not_removed,ive been using it with no problems on ios only thing i notice it doesnt do in ios is show the number of blocked app store redirects in its settings
jailbreak,not_removed,try disabling the app store route with ifile
jailbreak,not_removed,sounds alot like a hardware problem especially if it persist after rebooting into stock ios
jailbreak,not_removed,id like to send it to apple in that case but i dont want they update my iphone id rather stay with the problem
jailbreak,not_removed,replacement are sent back with test your luck op
jailbreak,not_removed,dont remember the reason for that error but use reiboot to get out of recovery edit what ipsw did you take the baseband sep and buildmanifest files from edit actually it looks like apples tss servers are down youll have to try again when its online
jailbreak,not_removed,question what made you decide to leave for ios
jailbreak,not_removed,use reiboot to get yourself out of the recover mode loop also i believe there is an nvram value to prevent that from happening so that if the process isnt complete as soon as you restart the device it boots up normally instead 🤔
jailbreak,not_removed,if i get out of recover it turns on and off after a few seconds probably due to image not being flashed correctly i took baseband sep and buildmanifest from
jailbreak,not_removed,mainly due to fact i want to pair an iwatch also since it seems is stable enough and there are easy signing tools from phone itself httpsyalujailbreaknetcydiaextender
jailbreak,not_removed,oh well in that case you have to restore through itunes unfortunately
jailbreak,not_removed,that net website isnt good
jailbreak,not_removed,restore to right or pray that once tss servers are back up and get a working nonce ticket in futurerestore why do you think apples tss servers are down
jailbreak,not_removed,could you be more specific on whats not good
jailbreak,not_removed,yes restore to no you wont get a working nonce the one you had is no longer in your nvram and seeing as youre on an iphone its impossible to get one without setting it in your nvram with a jailbreak the tss servers go down for maintenance occasionally i believe on the bright side though your touch id will work on lol
jailbreak,not_removed,this whole website is fake and you should not download from there any exe ipa is fake and should not be installed on your computer and phone
jailbreak,not_removed,are there any known tricks to update to beta and back to with my blobs or i would really want my jailbreak back
jailbreak,not_removed,okay i try to download sw only from official sites i meant to follow procedure from that site will that work
jailbreak,not_removed,no its never been possible without a jailbreak on iphone it was only ever possible on iphone air on beta but that is no longer being signed anyway even if beta was still being signed you wouldnt be able to downgrade sorry man
jailbreak,not_removed,like the tutorial they have
jailbreak,not_removed,go on redmondpie to check how to jailbreak like a noob its perfect
jailbreak,not_removed,crap will have to update to and hold my fingers crossed for a jailbreak soon are you sure there is no way to downgrade even with the shsh blobs i thought i was safe to downgrade with them
jailbreak,not_removed,there is no way for you to downgrade not sure what you mean by the last sentence though
jailbreak,not_removed,that guy doesnt know what hes talking about if you didnt realize lol
jailbreak,not_removed,no no no use futurerestore and the nonce generator method to upgrade to it can still be done on your current fw version
jailbreak,not_removed,dude did you even read anything that was said in this conversation
jailbreak,not_removed,yep most backgrounding functions audio task complete etc are functions of springboard thanks for writing this out
jailbreak,not_removed,its simple reallydisable the springboard daemon s edit seriously dont do this🙄
jailbreak,not_removed,so what if we stopped control centre from even loading at startup would this help
jailbreak,not_removed,i find it interesting that lockhtml and xen can cause huge springboard battery usage
jailbreak,not_removed,not sure
jailbreak,not_removed,just disable the control centre
jailbreak,not_removed,activator hooks into springboard
jailbreak,not_removed,but what if i want to use the control center again
jailbreak,not_removed,another toggle tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,so youre trying to go to ios
jailbreak,not_removed,youre going to have to reinstall the pangu jailbreak app either however you initially did it without a computer or through cydia impactor and the pangu app ipa on a computer in order to rejail real your phone this is because its a tethered jailbreak and the pangu app needs to run after a reboot and needs to be resigned every week
jailbreak,not_removed,im trying to do anything that i can to just start with a fresh phone whether that is going to ios i dont know im trying to not go to ios and hoping i can stay on when i reset my device with no computer the jailbreak apps refuse to delete
jailbreak,not_removed,hey thank you so much are there any guides to doing this im sorry if this is repetitive ive just really missed my jail broken phone
jailbreak,not_removed,try and download cydia eraser and go from there itll restore your device but keep it on the current os instead of updating it
jailbreak,not_removed,ios jailbreak links httpenpanguioipadkid all of these are the same pangu jailbreak and the official versions directions for version without computer press on install on the popup go to home screen you will see the app is loading once it switches to installing turn on airplane mode this happens quickly please be paying attention stay in airplane mode and do not turn on wifi until the app is fully downloaded it shouldnt take long after that go to settings ➡️ general ➡️ profiles device management ➡️ beijing profile if you havent yet turn wifi back on trust the developer notes regarding each version the chinese versions install a pirate app store and can be removed in cydia you can also uncheck the box the first time you run the app to prevent the installation of the pirate app store the english version requires you to check the box to get the april certificate the first time you run the app created for rjailbreak by uipadkid feel free to copy this post but please give credit this message has specifically been approved by the mods thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,do i need a computer for that
jailbreak,not_removed,also my iphone isnt jail broken but it has the jail broken apps
jailbreak,not_removed,tips for successfully running the pp pangu app on ios to ⁃ reboot using slide to power off ⁃ kill all apps from app switcher ⁃ disable low power mode ⁃ enable airplane mode ⁃ disable do not disturb mode
jailbreak,not_removed,no just install it from cydia and run it
jailbreak,not_removed,alight welp unless someone else has any other ideas cause im not too experienced since i have an untethered jailbreak it seems like dfu mode and restore is your only option then
jailbreak,not_removed,i cant because cydia always crashes on start
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you so much for your help im so confused at what to do
jailbreak,not_removed,lol he just needs to run the pp pangu app already told op just letting you know since i know you dont have much experience with this semiuntethered jailbreak stuff in case anyone else asks
jailbreak,not_removed,you have ifile or filza installed
jailbreak,not_removed,you need to get back into a jailbroken state by running the pp pangu app
jailbreak,not_removed,i do but that too crashes on start
jailbreak,not_removed,what library folder also you can delete preference files using icleaner
jailbreak,not_removed,thats different varmobilelibrary contains tweak files for some tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,i guess youre right but i suppose youll have to manually delete them and contact the developer to add it in
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i just did
jailbreak,not_removed,just wait
jailbreak,not_removed,im so excited i cant wait ahhhhhhhh
jailbreak,not_removed,being excited is fine but please dont be one of those people who shitposts like this if its real theyll release it if its not they wont bugging them on twitter amp continually making posts about every tweet of theirs wont help and if anything would just annoy any wouldbe jb developers just chill
jailbreak,not_removed,tru guess you have a point
jailbreak,not_removed,cydia substrate😉
jailbreak,not_removed,tetherme
jailbreak,not_removed,activator
jailbreak,not_removed,flex
jailbreak,not_removed,virtual home n just having that tweak to press the home button on my instead of actually clicking the button just feels more natural and it saves my home button from normal wear of all that clicking
jailbreak,not_removed,flex
jailbreak,not_removed,phantom snapchat
jailbreak,not_removed,im surprised nobody mentioned ccsettings fcc yet its so convenient
jailbreak,not_removed,springtomize or ios blocks or xen so many options ugghhhh probably ios blocks in a finished state
jailbreak,not_removed,barrel
jailbreak,not_removed,pangu apptweak
jailbreak,not_removed,minimal host blocker because it saves me a lot of data with an app that i use which requires you to pay to remove ads or else video ads eats up my data
jailbreak,not_removed,whatever lets me get back on snapchat and keep my jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,probably phantom but if you pick this one bioprotect becomes pretty much a must
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah curago is just the name of ios blocks package
jailbreak,not_removed,just recently found out about message customizer and i am loving it
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,noappstoreredirect not sure if its the correct name
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,dont make me choose between them i cant
jailbreak,not_removed,cydia substrate
jailbreak,not_removed,i prefer functionality over visual stuff either or any type of qc tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,m b
jailbreak,not_removed,youtube
jailbreak,not_removed,bioprotect
jailbreak,not_removed,oh you sneaky lil fucker
jailbreak,not_removed,read my mind
jailbreak,not_removed,i tried tetherme didnt really understand how it works tbh i also was nervous my carrier would find out lol
jailbreak,not_removed,whats tetherme seriously never heard of it could you fill me in on the basics
jailbreak,not_removed,definitely activator for me i could probably go stock if i had activator provided i still had the ability to create my own actions lol which is why it wont ever happen
jailbreak,not_removed,i like activator who doesnt haveneed activator however i dont understand some of the activator activation methods so i dont mess with activator that much why do you like it
jailbreak,not_removed,flex edit wow i feel hella dumb i thought umvalqui was using a face but really meant number didnt even know there was a flex until last night
jailbreak,not_removed,thats a good answer i mean shit man so many of my friends have to use assistive touch or whatever its called bc they break their homescreen button i used to have that tweak but i kept getting confused and forgetting i didnt need to actually press down on the home button lol
jailbreak,not_removed,is that better than snapchat
jailbreak,not_removed,ccsettings was almost a first for me has to be in my top
jailbreak,not_removed,i honestly prefer springtomize idk why a lot of people will prolly be like wtf after saying this haha ios blocks is kinda like curago i think i actually had to delete that today due to it messing with anchor making a blank springboard pages that wouldnt go away
jailbreak,not_removed,you mean the one you see on the tweak list well thats a pirate store just saying
jailbreak,not_removed,still might work idk
jailbreak,not_removed,disable the tweak in icleaner in to snapchat downgrade through appadmin reenable tweak its a new tos making problems
jailbreak,not_removed,bioprotect is great forgot bout that one gotta lock up dem right
jailbreak,not_removed,there are lots of things you can do with message customizer it is great you should download goes great if you want different custom theme setups

jailbreak,not_removed,wut
jailbreak,not_removed,yeaah i like savecloud and youtube
jailbreak,not_removed,hahaha you must have horrible friends dw same
jailbreak,not_removed,id want it too i cant jailbreak yet
jailbreak,not_removed,its pretty straight forward in my opinion you turn it on and whatever you have turned on is how it connects wifi bluetooth toggles usb tethering is always on i have sprint and officially only have of shared data but i tether several hundred gigs a month without issue
jailbreak,not_removed,it lets you share your phones data connection with other devices by either ethernet over usb wifi hotspot or bluetooth direct
jailbreak,not_removed,flex
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i definitely dont want my home button to end up like that its my number one tweak that i check to see if it works after a new jailbreak is released lol
jailbreak,not_removed,yeahh it has alot more features than snapchat and easier to use snapchat is complicated only downside is the ads but i paid to get it removed since i love the tweak so much it really depends on the person
jailbreak,not_removed,what makes you like this one more than polus just curious
jailbreak,not_removed,because it came first because its devs dont feel the need to overhype their tweak by spamming updating this subreddit with sneak peek announcement posts which happens to coincide with an influx of fanboys a plethora of supposed beta testers along with their seemingly disproportionate amount of upvotes who ofc have nothing but positive comments to say in regards to the tweak as well as the author because springtomize doesnt make exaggerated claims or statements including features that were promised to be added immediately after launch yet several weeksmonths later are still nowhere to be found and when asked about said promised features doesnt even have the courage aka balls to inform paid customers with a response just to name a few
jailbreak,not_removed,no the app itself got access to cydia and everything in it now
jailbreak,not_removed,it has a lot of features you can duplicate apps clean like icleaner install tweaks in a modern interface and even more i wish if its in english instead of chinese
jailbreak,not_removed,tsprotector could not find info about this tweaktheme bleep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work for me either im on an iphone ios and ive tried everything i tried upgrading it to the latest version im allowed and ive tried downgrading to older versions and nothing is working looks like im going to have to decide between snapchat and my jailbreak unless someone has any other suggestions or ideas

jailbreak,not_removed,will try thanks for letting me know
jailbreak,not_removed,edit my bad didnt see your flair lol
jailbreak,not_removed,wait im confused how does it not use the data in your plan
jailbreak,not_removed,i get where youre coming from and yeah i mean i understand how it works i just dont understand if it actually did work because i only tried it once then deleted it lol has sprint ever contacted you about this
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont understand some of the activation methods
jailbreak,not_removed,if not bro you gotta be on yo email ready to rant to the dev hahaha
jailbreak,not_removed,snapchat now has ads also so
jailbreak,not_removed,truuu i dont really care for snapchat tho lmaoo they need to update kik or whatever its called that was my shii
jailbreak,not_removed,great question the reason i like ccsettings more is because it works with lots of party tweaks polus was working for me for a few days but then it got very glitchy and annoying did they update it side note idk if polus works with cream but i do think that they added their own colors anyways
jailbreak,not_removed,damn preach it bro you got a great point its more real when theyre doing it from the heart ya feel me
jailbreak,not_removed,delete your snapchat tweak update snap log in downgrade snap reinstall tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,he has unæimited data but only of tethered data tetherme bypasses that restriction by pretending to be downloading and sending stuff from the phone rather than actually being tethered
jailbreak,not_removed,no i usually get a text saying ive exceeded my prioritized limit so i may get slower speeds during peak hours within the first day or two of my data cycle but ive never gotten anything from sprint about how much data i use or possible tethering i usually use about a month im in my first week of this cycle and have used but its been a light week i pay for unlimited data so i dont think they care ive had less drama with spring than any other us carrier ive used
jailbreak,not_removed,theres a tweak for kik called google it
jailbreak,not_removed,i feel ya also i appreciate your understanding and civility in regards to respecting individual opinions even if they may differ from your own which you have clearly demonstrated throughout this thread
jailbreak,not_removed,thats insane
jailbreak,not_removed,man im so jealous im up in canada and i gotta go with wind mobile which is the only prepaid network that has decent data plans a month for full speed and unlimited super super throttled like cant even watch youtube after the any other company wants like for prepaid and even the contract companies are charging like for anything over for iphone plans on contracts it starts at a month with only one i know of with real unlimited data is bell and they only do those plans when you get a new android phone for whatever reason they dont do unlimited with iphones for everywhere ive looked havent checked for about months so hopefully its changed since then but its pretty hurting for mobile deals up here man your so lucky to have companies like sprint
jailbreak,not_removed,ah i see thanks for letting me know any news when theyre releasing publicly
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks bro im new to reddit but yeah i joined to listen to other peoples opinions and speak mine and maybe try to help others out if i can lol im not that good at helping but if i could i would i help by listening thank you for telling me kikpro ill try it out
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,well if you get sprint or verizon maybe you could get tetherme and thatd help the thing is youd have to somehow unlock the phone you already have since it has
jailbreak,not_removed,i dunno if it works for but you could try kikpro on tonys repo along with a bunch of his other cool tho kinda off the grid tweaks httpsiostonykraftgithubio
jailbreak,not_removed,damnnnnn and thats just one month lmao other months prolly really are
jailbreak,not_removed,the youtube app has this option is that what youre talking about
jailbreak,not_removed,could you add this option to youtube pls
jailbreak,not_removed,couldnt you just disable autoplay unless youre talking about something completely different in an idiot
jailbreak,not_removed,yes indeed may i know the youtube app version you are using pls
jailbreak,not_removed,first of all you are not an idiot for asking a question secondly i was talking about how youtube automatically loads the next video and even plays it once we are done watching the video we wanted to watch just like how it happens in facebook when you watch a video
jailbreak,not_removed,this is version but i know its been there for a while
jailbreak,not_removed,just found that it gets hidden when hide video suggestions is enabled in youtube
jailbreak,not_removed,just updated to the same version and i just see it httpiimgurcomaykhknsjpg 🤔
jailbreak,not_removed,there we go glad you got it figure out
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks mate
jailbreak,not_removed,this happens when there is no more space left in the system partition of your device to fix this add httpscoolstarorgpublicrepo to cydia and install stashing for ios if you get the same error while trying to install stashing for ios remove a few tweaks install it and then install the tweaks back again
jailbreak,not_removed,touchr is a good one
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,httpcydiasaurikcompackagecomclezztouchr bigboss free tweaks touchid gestures touchid 手势 hi mom type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,yes snapchat and phantom for snapchat can supercharge your snapchat and no it doesnt slow anything down
jailbreak,not_removed,use phantom lite so u dont get banned repo is httpscokepokesgithubio
jailbreak,not_removed,we could tell you knew nothing about it from the fact you called a tweak a jailbreak no worries though we all start off somewhere with what we know just next time search the subreddit instead of making a new post
jailbreak,not_removed,but u have to use phantom lite
jailbreak,not_removed,httpsbetaunlimappscom add that as a repo although booting snapchat is slower
jailbreak,not_removed,bruh
jailbreak,not_removed,big issue
jailbreak,not_removed,there some videos online but i think a very well trust person is everythingapplepro and watch out there are a lot of scams
jailbreak,not_removed,in a recent post the developer commented that theyre looking into it but theyre not sure if its possible
jailbreak,not_removed,try a hard reboot home and power buttons simultaneously till apple logo appears and then release both buttons
jailbreak,not_removed,another one that works decent is reibiot
jailbreak,not_removed,just curious if you resolved this
jailbreak,not_removed,look up online how to exit recovery mode there are ways to force it out of it i think had one if that does not work you could be screwed
jailbreak,not_removed,was the first thing i did no luck
jailbreak,not_removed,tried this too nothing it wont pick up my phone
jailbreak,not_removed,phone had to be swapped out for a new one
jailbreak,not_removed,ireb helped me out once my man
jailbreak,not_removed,i take this to mean you couldnt even restore it to current firmware
jailbreak,not_removed,ireb actually works
jailbreak,not_removed,never heard of that one
jailbreak,not_removed,nope error
jailbreak,not_removed,theres nothing updated for a as far as i know
jailbreak,not_removed,are you using winterboard or anemone
jailbreak,not_removed,winterboard should i switch to anemone
jailbreak,not_removed,in winterboard make sure that the theme is above the masks youre trying to apply use the drag handles on the right to rearrange them lemme k ow if that works
jailbreak,not_removed,ive tried that doesnt work still weird thanks anyway
jailbreak,not_removed,anything about a onepage cc
jailbreak,not_removed,also to note this isnt in competition with noctis as horseshoe doesnt expand beyond a cc dark mode noctis is system wide
jailbreak,not_removed,horses hoe
jailbreak,not_removed,any landscape bugs
jailbreak,not_removed,good work andy nice teaser cant wait to get a jail broken ios soon
jailbreak,not_removed,horses hose
jailbreak,not_removed,the dev is forgetting about the volume slider and is not on there when you touch it either everyone is overlooking this for the hype
jailbreak,not_removed,nice work i wouldnt mind at all if the airdrop night shift air play buttons completely disappear to create more space
jailbreak,not_removed,goddamn that is the definition of sleek like my ballsack
jailbreak,not_removed,looks amazing man
jailbreak,not_removed,look great
jailbreak,not_removed,repo
jailbreak,not_removed,this is perfect
jailbreak,not_removed,thats really nice man good job
jailbreak,not_removed,that looks really really good shame it wont come to
jailbreak,not_removed,will this have extra toggles for like location and data etc
jailbreak,not_removed,any idea when this may be released or beta release also how much
jailbreak,not_removed,is this up and running yet
jailbreak,not_removed,anything on this
jailbreak,not_removed,isnt this just enabling the hidden darkmode in ios
jailbreak,not_removed,need some testers 😂
jailbreak,not_removed,remindme weeks
jailbreak,not_removed,well this is one page so im guessing this is it😂
jailbreak,not_removed,can we use noctis and horseshoe togehter
jailbreak,not_removed,also wondering what made him take this name
jailbreak,not_removed,im wondering this too
jailbreak,not_removed,the volume slider and brightness slider will be one in the same like the concept that was posted
jailbreak,not_removed,not released yet and will be bigboss as it will be a paid tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,i will make it compatible with flipswitch toggles
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,no
jailbreak,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of weeks to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
jailbreak,not_removed,no sorry
jailbreak,not_removed,there are four dots under the cc
jailbreak,not_removed,tons but of course i will fix them before release lol
jailbreak,not_removed,would you mind to show how since is not presented in the two sneak peack that where posted
jailbreak,not_removed,cool cant wait
jailbreak,not_removed,so any idea when it will be released or how much it will cost
jailbreak,not_removed,thats my fault i use my device to take screenshots for him since he cant yet those dots are there because of my tweak which adds pages
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you though technically that is platters by cp
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks man ❤️ nice to see the devs working hard on all their projects
jailbreak,not_removed,a anything you hear from cp regarding my tweaks in always going to be true i always work closely with him whether it be for screenshots or finding bugs b im not done with the tweak lol
jailbreak,not_removed,ok i didnt think about it one question are you planning on making this tweak customizable like giving the option to choose which elements the user wants to have on their cc and on which position thatd be cool
jailbreak,not_removed,also the ability to change some of the sizes because if we want to add night mode eclipse to the cc we can reduce the size of night shift to add the night mode button saw the developer mentioning it somewhere
jailbreak,not_removed,thats difficult because with things being different sizes that can get bad really quickly
jailbreak,not_removed,try holding the home and the power button again
jailbreak,not_removed,you brokeknocked something loose when you dropped it has this phone ever been opened up before
jailbreak,not_removed,even while attached to a computer holding the power and home button for over seconds still does nothing
jailbreak,not_removed,thats what i assumed to be honest the phone has not been opened up i just got it a month ago from the insurance company looking back on it this is probably a refurbished phone so it might have been opened up i totally forgot about that i think i might go contact them and see whats going on wow that makes a lot of sense now i totally forgot that this is not a new phone
jailbreak,not_removed,and holding only the power button does nothing
jailbreak,not_removed,definitely sounds like hardware good luck
jailbreak,not_removed,correct
jailbreak,not_removed,this is confirmation bias the number of jailbreakers reporting these thefts is substantially smaller than the amount of jailbreakers who report no thefts whatsoever you just hear from those who have had info stolen because they report it you hear more from these people than you do from those who dont get stolen from because the latter have nothing to report urgent my personal info did not just get stolen that isnt to say this isnt a tense situation it just isnt nearly as rampant as people say it is you see the reports of peoples info getting stolen but dont hear reports of peoples jailbreaks going just fine ive jailbroken and restored my ipad dozens of times in the last week alone and my sensitive information is still secure all in all take caution and uncheck the ppstore app
jailbreak,not_removed,its been a week since i installed jailbreak no issues whatsoever
jailbreak,not_removed,all these reports prove is that people get hacked every day
jailbreak,not_removed,finally a voice of reason reading the comments in that article im convinced that were all going to die terrible deaths and then burn in hell for all eternity after having all our possessions stolen and our pets molested
jailbreak,not_removed,substantially small is correct it seems that on this sub it was people who got hacked twelve out of a couple hundred thousand people who jailbreak mathematically speaking the odds of it being the jb are unlikely
jailbreak,not_removed,is the ppstore app that begins with pp and then has chinese characters also has a white top left corner with pangu logo i cant run the app because i havent trusted it apparently but i dont know if this is just the app to rejailbreak or whether its the ppstore app people are talking about edit it seems like its the rejailbreak app and that the store actually starts with i used the chinese installer and dont remember unchecking any boxes so its interesting i dont have the app store however i wonder if i can accept the developer later and still rejailbreak when i lose my jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,now youre gonna wake up tomorrow and find out the chinese stole your house
jailbreak,not_removed,right the point of all of this is not to scare anyone who decided to jailbreak but you should absolutely be aware of what youre dealing with here then what the fuck is your point benji ಠಠ
jailbreak,not_removed,only oh and what i want to know is if they ever used the password on the pc before cause if this thing is legit im guessing its computer side not phone side
jailbreak,not_removed,the windows tool doesnt install the appstore the same app that installs cydia has a checkbox on by default to install the app store
jailbreak,not_removed,chinese already stole a whole fucking sea just saying
jailbreak,not_removed,from what i saw on the reddit thread covering it only about people are listed as affected possible other people got lost in the comments
jailbreak,not_removed,the app that installs cydia is also a windows tool is it not so the first one just installs the one program while the second program installs cydia i did both and must have unchecked something somewhere regardless im glad i dont have the app
jailbreak,not_removed,true
jailbreak,not_removed,honestly i believe its not or pangu they are a big company that make bank i doubt chump change like that would make them risk it all pangu even made a reddit account talking to ppl
jailbreak,not_removed,the app that installs cydia is also a windows tool is it not no this jailbreak consists of an ios app that once installed and opened installs cydia and optionally the appstore the windows pphelper tool simply installs the ios app used to jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,what are those three or four tweaks list everything you have installed
jailbreak,not_removed,tweak list
jailbreak,not_removed,you said you only installed a few tweaks right use icleaner pro to disable those tweaks and toggle on one tweak at a time using your phone in between toggling to see if it happens if it doesnt happen toggle on the next tweak and use your device for a bit if it still doesnt happen toggle on another tweak and so on until you find which tweak is causing it
jailbreak,not_removed,simple but useful hold volume up next song hold volume down previous song hold both playpause i hate to take my phone out or use the headphone speaker that doesnt do what i want him to do of the time
jailbreak,not_removed,disable cellular data upon connecting to wifi enable cellular data upon disconnecting from wifi double press sleep button for flashlight and one tweak for bigshotjb and another to take pictures and videos discreetly lol
jailbreak,not_removed,turn off data when i connect to wifi very useful
jailbreak,not_removed,any of them
jailbreak,not_removed,i love these
jailbreak,not_removed,tell me more about the tweak for bigshotjb and picturesvideos please
jailbreak,not_removed,why would you turn off your data when on wifi
jailbreak,not_removed,well its simply and
jailbreak,not_removed,cause itll continue to try and find good signal which will lead to battery wasting

jailbreak,not_removed,ah thanks mate
jailbreak,not_removed,wow this is very interesting will add this for sure i thought apple had some way to remove this
jailbreak,not_removed,actually he is a little arrogant and little stupid so itunes report the date of the next update check not the current date or the update date in europe its daymonthyear so its june next check for update if you look closely youll see that on screen it says may which is midnight so due to time different around the world youtube may report usa clock on upload time which is hours behind greece clock so may i dont say they have a real jailbreak but i believe arrogant comments like this from both sides just make community look like a kindergarden
jailbreak,not_removed,theres a fuckin megathread for a reason
jailbreak,not_removed,oh shit nice find
jailbreak,not_removed,shouldnt the itunes date be jun instead of may just format difference
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i didnt really believe them since they didnt want to posf sha or kpp like qwerty had said
jailbreak,not_removed,i think hes just annoyed by the math not adding up gsmajics response seems pretty juvenile as well anything is possible with so many unknowns but it sounds more like some kid having his version of fun rather than a serious jailbreak developer either way anyone buying into this without some serious scrutiny could find themselves in a fools paradise and the terrain may even look familiar those who dont learn from their mistakes are condemned to repeat them
jailbreak,not_removed,well gsm do say that it has a simple explanation and it does seem to have a simple explanation the jailbreak couldve been achieved on may hence the video description although may is a thursday not a saturday as they mentioned youtube video says published may but terminal says may possibly due to the fact that the video was recorded at and youtube uses gmt to standardise upload times greece is hours ahead of gmt itunes says june not may date format difference and that hardly means anything anyway it just says that thats when itunes will next check for software updates correct me if im wrong
jailbreak,not_removed,i have no idea what this means
jailbreak,not_removed,can you all give it a fucking rest if theyre fake theyre fake if theyre real be patient and then be grateful when it drops stop reposting everything these people retweet this is enmtw all over again
jailbreak,not_removed,this mohklas guy seems like a dick has he done anything worthwhile or is he just a shittalker
jailbreak,not_removed,awww sounds like someone needs to be put on the nipple
jailbreak,not_removed,httpiimgurcomaawynhagif
jailbreak,not_removed,what
jailbreak,not_removed,what
jailbreak,not_removed,what
jailbreak,not_removed,so his proof that its fake is because the jb was madediscovered on may but the video wasnt put out until may
jailbreak,not_removed,but what if we made a mistake not believing in pangu we actually didnt believe in pangu when they were new and they turned out to be legit by your standards we should therefore not only believe in gsmagic but support them
jailbreak,not_removed,deleted
jailbreak,not_removed,hes a dev you may know him from revealmenu cant think of much else off the top of my head but he is correct proof taken from the exact video as well
jailbreak,not_removed,he did a bit of work with side loading certain tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,he has been around for a while i remember using a tool he made to bypass a passcode so i could change it on older devices hes been in the scene a few years
jailbreak,not_removed,him sounding like a dick could also be a derivative of english not being his first language
jailbreak,not_removed,i think hes a developer but im not completely sure
jailbreak,not_removed,hes a dev you may know him from revealmenu cant think of much else off the top of my head but he is correct proof taken from the exact video as well
jailbreak,not_removed,theres a megathread for posts like these no need to post as different threads
jailbreak,not_removed,oh shit nice find httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubot
jailbreak,not_removed,we were right by not believing pangu at first its always good to be skeptical but instead of losing time on twitter and faking videos they released a jailbreak tool and shared useful information with other researchers so now we trust them thats how this should work i dont understand why people fall for a new fake every week
jailbreak,not_removed,i have no idea what this means httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubot
jailbreak,not_removed,it just seems like hes being very demanding and assholish
jailbreak,not_removed,awww sounds like someone needs to be put on the nipple httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubot

jailbreak,not_removed,hahahhahah
jailbreak,not_removed,what
jailbreak,not_removed,i think hes fed up with the fakers just as much as we are and i dont recall him demanding anything but he was a bit rude ill give you that
jailbreak,not_removed,i think hes fed up with the fakers just as much as we are and i dont recall him demanding anything but he was a bit rude ill give you that
jailbreak,not_removed,this was a long time ago like years ago so unfortunately i have no idea of its name all i remember was it was on windows
jailbreak,not_removed,gecko toolkit can do it you will need windows im almost positive it doesnt work with and you will need older versions of java and itunes etc its easier to do on a fresh install so you might want to make a partition on a drive and just install it there there is guides on the net to do in pretty sure
jailbreak,not_removed,what
jailbreak,not_removed,wat
jailbreak,not_removed,coughs i have no idea what this means httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubot
jailbreak,not_removed,wow thats a lot of work hah thank you though ill give it a goo
jailbreak,not_removed,in da but
jailbreak,not_removed,there are several location fakers in cydia and when i played around with them i found that most wont effect fmi only one would unfortunately i dont remember which one it was hopefully someone here has it and will chime in
jailbreak,not_removed,locationfaker
jailbreak,not_removed,fake gps free or pro
jailbreak,not_removed,just fyi i have yet to find one of these apps that works with find my iphone may but i havent been able to install it on yet seems to only work with so far awaiting an update from the developer
jailbreak,not_removed,while jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,fake gps pro httpcydiaupdatescompkgcntinyappsxgpspro works with it however if you havent purchased it before i dont think you can until purchases are enabled in cydia i think theres also an option to purchase it directly from within the app though again i cant say as ive had it for well over a year now and had no issue redownloading it as it was already previously purchased just used it to fake my location miles away from where i am fired up find iphone and it shows me as being in said location spoofed
jailbreak,not_removed,last edited hour ago originally while jailbroken wasnt in there p
jailbreak,not_removed,most of these apps work fine with find my iphone on the same device but have you tried it from another ios device or from your icloud account thats where i find the difference is
jailbreak,not_removed,i just purchased the pro version and sadly it does not report my device in the spoofed location from other ios devices or from icloud wonder if theres a refund option of course it does report my spoofed location on my iphones find my iphone app but not on other devices which is why i was looking for a spoofer about years ago i used an app that did work the way i was looking for just wish i knew what it was called
jailbreak,not_removed,oops i missed that one thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,yup tried it on another device as well as the website interface have to give it a few minutes after plotting the spoofed location at least with fake gps for it to actually show
jailbreak,not_removed,ok if you got it to work then ill give it a bit more time and try some more before i show it the door what version of ios are you on
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,curious do you use any of the app white list features or the addons handle preferences ive pretty much left everything default in the app except my location and the play button was pressed so that i see the pause button now still not seeing it spoofed in icloud or other ios device my ipad and my spoofed location has been set for about minutes
jailbreak,not_removed,nope installed dragged pin to where i wanted to spoof hit play lit up red and spoofs said location did you make sure to allow fake gps to use your location im all but sure you did since you said its working in other apps and just not find my iphone but mines been working and is still working just fine takes a bit also try loading the weather app after you spoof the location try to use a city of miles away or so and see if weather is updating to reflect that location once it does then see if its showing right in find my iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,yep on all accounts weather immediatly changed to the city on my map and other gps related apps all show my new spoofed location its only find my iphone on other ios devices and icloudcom that are still showing my current location maybe after i leave work and go home when my real location changes ill see if they are still showing it shrug
jailbreak,not_removed,as an update i used cydias new tool called impactor and redid my jailbreak things seem to be better now and even gps faker seems to be working as expected albit a bit slow to update on outside devices
jailbreak,not_removed,its saying that you need substrate safe mode refresh your sources its saying it cant find substrate safe mode in cydia
jailbreak,not_removed,install substrate safe mode from cydia first then install that tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,it makes more sense to use something builtin to the os imo
jailbreak,not_removed,if you actually followed his twitter youd be informed that the dev is aware of this issue fix is coming
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,dont remember what the tweak is called but i know there is an option to put a gif or photo when the password is input incorrectly
jailbreak,not_removed,i have it working using ah ah ah only problem is that it plays to long and there is no way to set up a custom timeout for the playback also wish i had a version that had cleaner audio maybe something from the third debate
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i want one
jailbreak,not_removed,if anyone have clean edited version without hillarys voice please drop here

jailbreak,not_removed,very sneaky very nice
jailbreak,not_removed,wouldnt a vibration take the phone off focus
jailbreak,not_removed,it is not possible the phone tries its best to take all bursts in focus it is not a burst of random focuses
jailbreak,not_removed,good idea try cross posting in rtweakbounty
jailbreak,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking maybe an onscreen indicator is better
jailbreak,not_removed,thats what i was thinking the phone tries to get in focus and it usually thinks its in focus even if something may not be focused on what youre trying to focus on
jailbreak,not_removed,or any indication would suffice
jailbreak,not_removed,i understand it tries to take all photos in focus but it does point to the ones that are best doesnt that make it seem possible i would just need an indication when it deemed at least one is in focus it was just an idea anyway thanks yall

jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work on ios
jailbreak,not_removed,none of the patches i tried could this includes the ones for
jailbreak,not_removed,yes plus its even worse when you actually have the app installed
jailbreak,not_removed,didnt know thank you im still on
jailbreak,not_removed,can you give me the web address so i can try it
jailbreak,not_removed,ah maybe someone will update it someday
jailbreak,not_removed,stashing from coolstar public repo
jailbreak,not_removed,theres no more space on your system partition where tweaks are installed you could either stash use icleaner pro after uninstalling some tweaks cant use cydia eraser move the lingusticdata folder messes up backups as ive been told note ive heard of people having problems with storage resizing is very complicated and the margin of error is high
jailbreak,not_removed,you can stash clean up your tweaks or remove languages images from ios those are pretty much your options i would recommend simply cleaning up if youre that full you probably have too much stuff installed for your own good anyways
jailbreak,not_removed,hello thank you for your participation in rjailbreak however your submission was removed for the following reasons this is already answered on the which is this is already answered on the httpswwwredditcomrjailbreakwikifaq if you have any questions about this removal please feel free to
jailbreak,not_removed,deleted
jailbreak,not_removed,if instead of taking a risk and moving the linguistic data you can delete all of the unused languages ive been doing this since ios or i believe the only folders i dont mess with are the en ones and the one labeled cyrl ive never had a problem with backups either took myself from to edit as well as the infoplist
jailbreak,not_removed,no dont do this if you do this using cydia eraser in the future will get very hard its better to stash with coolstars stashing
jailbreak,not_removed,yes work well
jailbreak,not_removed,yes it does
jailbreak,not_removed,usually the biggest one is finding holesexploitsvulns and everything ive ever learned about finding and working on jb related stuff is by being familiar with not only ios but the history of ios from a technical aspect
jailbreak,not_removed,do a google search
jailbreak,not_removed,upvote please some dev take up this endeavor
jailbreak,not_removed,try out using a vpn generally works
jailbreak,not_removed,i was in a school which blocked vpns what i did was turn on my vpn using my or then switch to wifi usually works but if it doesnt try other vpn services i use betternet
jailbreak,not_removed,tried doesnt work
jailbreak,not_removed,im pretty sure i tried doing that but i will try tomorrow and see if that works ill download these vpns and try them tomorrow usually it will just fail to connect but who knows
jailbreak,not_removed,theres multiple good free vpns try one of these hexatech betternet hotspot shield when it comes down to it one will eventually work schools cant legit block all vpns
jailbreak,not_removed,can you use data lel
jailbreak,not_removed,no my schools like a black hole i can get bars max if im lucky normally i have no service
jailbreak,not_removed,welp thats shit sorry not sure then but if i find anything ill let you know
jailbreak,not_removed,if i remember correctly you just reboot normally to get out of safe mode or no substrate mode since you are stuck at the logo try to boot into no substrate mode by turning it off then when you turn it on and see the apple logo hold the volume up key until it boots to the lockscreen and let me know if you are able to get that far
jailbreak,not_removed,ios doesnt exist though
jailbreak,not_removed,awesome man always glad to hear a jailbreak problem was resolved
jailbreak,not_removed,dude patent this before it surfaces on ios as the most innovative design yet
jailbreak,not_removed,you can swipe the default ios action menu instead of tapping the arrows the concept is still way better than stock but swiping the stock one is better than trying to tap those minuscule buttons
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i knew i hated the actionmenu but this finally showed me what a better alternative would be please
jailbreak,not_removed,uh why is this not a thing
jailbreak,not_removed,why in earth isnt it like that by default
jailbreak,not_removed,skip having to click the arrow and go directly to the drop down menu
jailbreak,not_removed,if at least someone could make edit menus to show up in the same position every time i need it edit how many times have you guysgals been fooled to tap the wrong option and the edit menu was the one to blame by moving away suddenly with no warning specially when you most need it
jailbreak,not_removed,would be nice to credit the
jailbreak,not_removed,very nice presentation may i know how do you make this demo i have a few ideas i wanted to share as well
jailbreak,not_removed,such a great idea

jailbreak,not_removed,to me itd be better if that scrolling list opened up first instead of having to click the button maybe make it an option for the tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,niiice
jailbreak,not_removed,really nice idea
jailbreak,not_removed,yesss
jailbreak,not_removed,holy shit
jailbreak,not_removed,😍😍😍
jailbreak,not_removed,i have never seen an upvote like this wow
jailbreak,not_removed,wow just wow
jailbreak,not_removed,upvotes omfg
jailbreak,not_removed,apple used to be a design company its phones were heralded as easy to use and modern now theyre clunky glass wafers this is why jailbreak is necessary
jailbreak,not_removed,personally i like it much more the way it is now i personally usually only use the first three options and having that drop down menu is completely unnecessary takes more screen space as well just my preference and opinion
jailbreak,not_removed,i use notes on my ipad in the little multitasking view and the action menu is such a pain when the panewindow is small this would be a huge improvement
jailbreak,not_removed,how would that look like if the text you select takes the whole width of the screen
jailbreak,not_removed,honestly the arrow is horrible instant drop down is the way to go here
jailbreak,not_removed,this should be configurable option for actionmenu
jailbreak,not_removed,this would make life so much easier
jailbreak,not_removed,pls make this happen now
jailbreak,not_removed,you skipped the part where it took minutes to actually select just the word that you wanted to select thats the part that needs work
jailbreak,not_removed,nice idea but wow so many upvotes
jailbreak,not_removed,this is so fucking tidy learn apple
jailbreak,not_removed,emailed this to eugenio chessa the dev
jailbreak,not_removed,awesome
jailbreak,not_removed,need
jailbreak,not_removed,want
jailbreak,not_removed,great need this
jailbreak,not_removed,remindme week
jailbreak,not_removed,its fucking awesome 👏🏻
jailbreak,not_removed,i love it
jailbreak,not_removed,this looks great o i hope this can become a thing
jailbreak,not_removed,must acquire
jailbreak,not_removed,its beautiful
jailbreak,not_removed,its nice but im looking for a dev to make a tweak to replace select all by touching a selected word to definelookup the word who is awesome enough to make it happen
jailbreak,not_removed,this seems amazing too amazing for those idevice with no touch
jailbreak,not_removed,nice design
jailbreak,not_removed,how you post gif
jailbreak,not_removed,thats similar to android nouget but scrollable
jailbreak,not_removed,thatd be awesome
jailbreak,not_removed,this made it to the front page of reddit well done
jailbreak,not_removed,why does it have to scroll there is plenty of screen for the whole menu
jailbreak,not_removed,that second menu should come up as default instead of having to click the expand button
jailbreak,not_removed,sometimes when i see these stuff i just wonder why they arent already on ios and why apple takes so long to make minimal stuff better
jailbreak,not_removed,yo i was wondering if you could just highlight the text hold on it and scroll like snapseed scroll menu only shows on tap and hold
jailbreak,not_removed,i loooveeee this fantastic idea
jailbreak,not_removed,this is revolutionary my friend
jailbreak,not_removed,how about alongside this more accurate highlighting so it doesnt highlight the entire paragraph every time i try to highlight a single sentence
jailbreak,not_removed,holy batman look at them upvotes
jailbreak,not_removed,what tweak is this
jailbreak,not_removed,if someone can create this they will automatically receive the goat title
jailbreak,not_removed,if it adds a clipboard feature where you can copy multiple texts that would be sick
jailbreak,not_removed,not sure if they patented it that should be impossible and if it did happen itd be quite easy for the flux developers to get it revoked if thatd happend the place where they patented it prob made a mistake while figuring out if something similliar already excisted if you are interested in this subject read some books about intellectual property its not that hard companys just seek the limit all the time a nice example is that bouncy thingy on the iphone when you zoom in to the max on a photo and then try to zoom in even more steve jobs presented it by accident when the iphone or got released but he did that before they patented it as a result apple could not do it anymore
jailbreak,not_removed,i believe match better that this no need to click on board to copy or whatever
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont get this like do people just think because you can throw together a gif that people can magically code it
jailbreak,not_removed,what a shitty idea
jailbreak,not_removed,what like this
jailbreak,not_removed,make this compatible with ios and also
jailbreak,not_removed,apple probably already tried this but found a reason not to do it too many error presses
jailbreak,not_removed,cummed
jailbreak,not_removed,patent for scrollable vertical list of options yah thatll go through
jailbreak,not_removed,android has this exact same thing since marshmallow i believe but it doesnt have as many actions by default i think apps can add themselves to it
jailbreak,not_removed,you cant patent it anymore because of this publication same goes for apple when they start using it at this moment anyone may make this but no one may claim
jailbreak,not_removed,patent trolls could have so much fun with this patent it and post this all over rapple
jailbreak,not_removed,ok for real though when was the last time apple used the word innovative or revolutionary in their keynotes you see people complaining about it as often as them actually saying it probably more
jailbreak,not_removed,thats a good tip though
jailbreak,not_removed,i had no idea thanks for the tip
jailbreak,not_removed,people dont know
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for this info
jailbreak,not_removed,almost everything on ios is scrollable why is this surprising to people
jailbreak,not_removed,its horizontal so that it doesnt obscure your selection
jailbreak,not_removed,it is but its only on android so it isnt invented yet
jailbreak,not_removed,because longer options wont fit on it the scrollable one can handle much longer buttons if necessary
jailbreak,not_removed,is on stock android
jailbreak,not_removed,because no one thought of implementing it
jailbreak,not_removed,you can scroll vertically instead of tapping on the arrows and this way it doesnt obscure your selection
jailbreak,not_removed,cuz if you highlight several words at once then the box covers up the stuff you highlighted not acceptable by apple logic
jailbreak,not_removed,yes because the cut copy and paste options are already at the top of the scrollable list so it would save you time if you were trying to get to the last without it taking more time to get to the first
jailbreak,not_removed,original creator you could do it with multiple tools photoshop sketch adobe studiosomething etc etc etc etc
jailbreak,not_removed,ditto
jailbreak,not_removed,why do people comment stuff like this nice same this there is a button for that
jailbreak,not_removed,and you never will again this is rjailbreak home of the free downvotes
jailbreak,not_removed,now lmao
jailbreak,not_removed,hahaha definitely
jailbreak,not_removed,we need an android selector theirs is way better
jailbreak,not_removed,that cant be right lol its like times more than the sticky thread

jailbreak,not_removed,wow super cool thanks for posting this
jailbreak,not_removed,but it wont work for selecting text on a non input field eg websites on safari
jailbreak,not_removed,there are a lot of talented devs in our community that can there has been other concepts i have seen here through the years that look way harder or more improbable than this that have come to light as tweaks
jailbreak,not_removed,clearly you dont get coding 😂
jailbreak,not_removed,the first thing in coding is thinking same as concepts then comes the algorithm then coding
jailbreak,not_removed,i can tell if thats sarcasm but your entitled to ur opinion
jailbreak,not_removed,or this httpiimgurcomllsshhipng sorry ios guys weve had that since quite a while now
jailbreak,not_removed,please please please
jailbreak,not_removed,ew
jailbreak,not_removed,huh
jailbreak,not_removed,are u dumb or something
jailbreak,not_removed,deleted
jailbreak,not_removed,i take it you dont know much about patents
jailbreak,not_removed,yep they can sup fellow android user
jailbreak,not_removed,how did they incorporate flux into ios when it had been publicised
jailbreak,not_removed,next time hell stick it in all the way
jailbreak,not_removed,good design is obvious to the user you dont get to blame the user for not realizing
jailbreak,not_removed,it seems so unscrollable if that exists i didnt know too
jailbreak,not_removed,the action menu pops up at a position that doesnt block both ends of the text grabbers since thats whats most important if one wants to add to the current selection this shouldnt be a problem with this concept holding any end of the grabber makes the action menu disappear temporarily until selection is completed even when selecting a large amount of text on stock horizontal the action menu covers part of the selected but spares the grabber how many of these really beautiful concepts on this subreddit make it to development i intend to keep track of this one
jailbreak,not_removed,wat
jailbreak,not_removed,not innovative enough
jailbreak,not_removed,so limit the character length for each button label max characters enough for most commands
jailbreak,not_removed,the story of most things i see on this subreddit
jailbreak,not_removed,but its not real scrolling its just a gesture that activates the same behavior as the arrow buttons do feels like someone slapped the code together quickly to work around there being too many buttons and then never remembered to revise it for better usability
jailbreak,not_removed,i think thats a fair compromise they made especially seeing as the stock menu is actually horizontally scrollable and you dont need to fiddle with those side buttons
jailbreak,not_removed,cuz i need attention
jailbreak,not_removed,yes this a thousand times
jailbreak,not_removed,this
jailbreak,not_removed,almost this blew up af

jailbreak,not_removed,can it be fixed for
jailbreak,not_removed,i meant just on apps for sites yeah totally true
jailbreak,not_removed,you make no sense i learnt to code over years ago with visual basic and aha got to start somewhere so i first learnt to draw a gui then code the functions based on the objects drawn things like timers being invisible to the end user but still drawn onto the form languages lua ruby asm java delphi and c and an always learning later regardless if its event driven object orientated or paradigm programming i still picture and often drawsketch my guis long before ive even named a method so i think its entirely possible and highly likely that plenty ppl plan out a gui before a single line of code is written
jailbreak,not_removed,im not being sarcastic sigh ok im going to explain why thats a crap of an idea one of the main goals one must have when designing a user interface is get the number of steps required to get to any point on your application from any other point as minimal as possible so lets count the number of interactions on the current design hold the word to open the menu up to this point we just need another tap to get the cut copy and paste options another tap to get more options now we just need another tap to get the replace and style options another tap to get more options now we just need another tap to get the define and speak options on this gif the current design only goes up to these options but the new revolutionary design that someone commented you should patent this idea have two more share and quote another tap to get more options now we just need another tap to get the share and quote options ok now lets look at the purposed design hold the word to open the menu cut copy and paste are one tap away tap the three dots to get more options ohh now look the cut copy and paste are in the menu why would i tap the three dots to get the same options i could get before why not just pop the scrollable list right after holding the word but no it can get worse to get more options you need to scroll the list to choose the option youll need one more tap look the maximum number of user interactions before and after is the same no improvement at all now heres my solution hey look at how much space we have on the screen why on earth developers choose to pop such tiny menus when nowadays phones displays are soo huge hold the word a menu is about to pop now if the selected word is at the bottom of the screen the menu shows up at the top and vice versa this way we can make the menu as large as possible without getting in the way and show as much options as we can this way we minimize the number of taps needed to interact with the user interface i would go with a two columns menu if possible one more tap to choose the option boom now were talking
jailbreak,not_removed,wow options non scrollable great job android its not about the fact its vertical its about the scroll function
jailbreak,not_removed,bill nye holds a patent for a clear plastic bag full of water the american patent system is a complete joke
jailbreak,not_removed,cause they were new ways of doing something
jailbreak,not_removed,what makes you think that
jailbreak,not_removed,why does it say iphone in your tag puts on tinfoil cap
jailbreak,not_removed,the robots are taking over
jailbreak,not_removed,i really meant in the context of this sub most people who jailbreak are pretty familiar with the platform average users not as much
jailbreak,not_removed,what if your selection spans the full width of the screen
jailbreak,not_removed,ah of course the font isnt in helvetica neue ultra light
jailbreak,not_removed,ok see how the video shows this feature thats how its implemented in android less drop down options though
jailbreak,not_removed,yaaaa you tell them
jailbreak,not_removed,at least theyre honest
jailbreak,not_removed,that
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i am
jailbreak,not_removed,you can install anywherepredict by poomsmart to fix that
jailbreak,not_removed,ive got knowledge of several languages too and i dont see this being all that difficult however i know none ios related so im could be wrong
jailbreak,not_removed,please include a tldr
jailbreak,not_removed,except app developers could add their own entries in there
jailbreak,not_removed,lmao what
jailbreak,not_removed,sliding doors also slide to unlock the concept wasnt that new
jailbreak,not_removed,wanna know why
jailbreak,not_removed,then you just have to deal with not seeing a small portion of the wall of text you have highlighted
jailbreak,not_removed,what if they shot you in the face
jailbreak,not_removed,the other thing
jailbreak,not_removed,cool please let me know if it happened ✌🏼️
jailbreak,not_removed,ive added this request tweak concept on reddit please take a look at it mr developer
jailbreak,not_removed,i think there is a patch on flex for that thx bro
jailbreak,not_removed,number of taps on current design hold the word cut copy paste replace style define speak share quote number of taps on purposed design hold the word cut copy paste cut copy paste replace style scroll to get define speak share quote tap to choose the option same number of taps pn both designs my purpose hold the word big twocolumns menu shows up with all options tap to choose the menu option boom
jailbreak,not_removed,could doesnt mean will
jailbreak,not_removed,bill nye holds a patent for a clear plastic bag full of water
jailbreak,not_removed,he has a patent for an educational magnifying glass that uses a bag filled with water for the lens he didnt just patent a shopping bag full of water
jailbreak,not_removed,its supposed to be a magnifying glass but its still just a clear plastic bag with water in it
jailbreak,not_removed,inventor nye william s applicant nye william s a collapsible lens designed to be used as an educational device is constructed from a pouch of polyethylene plastic that is shaped to form a convex lens when filled with water the pouch has an edge region positioned adjacent and coextensive with a portion of the radial periphery of the pouch the edge region has an inlet and outlet opening for use in filling and emptying the lens the openings are closed by a channellock seam
jailbreak,not_removed,a phones not a door
jailbreak,not_removed,because this is an ios subforum and i totally came from the frontpage without checking d
jailbreak,not_removed,i said that to a cop once
jailbreak,not_removed,scrolling isnt a tap the proposed design would only have steps hold scroll tap also just by holding it would already show more options to use because it is compact in a list view where as standard it only shows options
jailbreak,not_removed,it makes perfect sense that devs get to decide what goes in that context menu they might have custom markup or all sorts of other things in addition to the standard os functions like clipboard and share with the scrolling personally i think thats poor ux anyway better to expand the full list which incidentally is exactly what android does httpiimgurcomgjfwlsppng i suppose at some point you might get so many options that youd need a scroll in that case though maybe you should have some sort of toolbar for them instead
jailbreak,not_removed,whup tee doo
jailbreak,not_removed,its all about perspective
jailbreak,not_removed,its a plastic bag with water in it
jailbreak,not_removed,you make a good point there
jailbreak,not_removed,the concept wasnt that new
jailbreak,not_removed,its a door to my soul
jailbreak,not_removed,doors and phones are able to be locked
jailbreak,not_removed,haha uhm i still do have the iphone although it has no screen a bloating battery dead lock button ripped screen ribbon cable ehm its fine
jailbreak,not_removed,pffft lol i also cant remember exactly why i said that line to the above comments probably something about the the probability of it not working
jailbreak,not_removed,scrolling is more than a tap it is a tap movement tap drag regardless scrolling is a user interaction the proposed design would only have steps hold scroll tap you forgot the three dots to get the scrollable list
jailbreak,not_removed,i understand your point i was just saying not all devs will implement the functions for example we have touch id on iphones and apps can use this api to add that to log in to their apps but not all app developers chose to use this api but yeah it does look alright im not knocking on it but i prefer scrolls to each their own i suppose
jailbreak,not_removed,we are all bill nye on this blessed day
jailbreak,not_removed,subtle
jailbreak,not_removed,from my perspective the patent trolls are evil
jailbreak,not_removed,whats your point
jailbreak,not_removed,seems in working condition to me ⌐■■
jailbreak,not_removed,i think you guys want this too take a 👀 at it
jailbreak,not_removed,you can tell its bill nye because of the way it is
jailbreak,not_removed,then you are lost
jailbreak,not_removed,same i may do the jump back to ios one day but considering how poor jailbreaks are recently rather pushes me away
jailbreak,not_removed,nope you know what thats why i love linux you want a feature go code yourself its open its free and it is not that hard
jailbreak,not_removed,pull my hair anakin
jailbreak,not_removed,well people wanted it
jailbreak,not_removed,these are uninformed opinions which no one should listen
jailbreak,not_removed,look dude that concept is something that already exists on the 💻 something that  will someday bring to other products like the ipad and 📱 so what im saying is that its a little touch why not get it before  besides its way convenient to use a feature that some people might use often than this concept above
jailbreak,not_removed,its all about the user interactions count you gotta bring it down make it easier to get where you want no one want to tap the screen or times to get anywhere i think everyone agrees with it the design the op is purposing is just bad period doesnt improve nothing thats it
jailbreak,not_removed,just go there and smash that up vote button yeah smash it
jailbreak,not_removed,chooseboard paid has activator actions you could try this to activate specific keyboards on opening certain apps if you want to change keyboard on exit you can try the checkapp script hth
jailbreak,not_removed,can you please explain how the script works and how we set it up
jailbreak,not_removed,chooseboard doest work
jailbreak,not_removed,shows how i use it link to the original reddit post by httpsmredditcomuserartificialsugar
jailbreak,not_removed,just tested it again havent used it this way in a while and it worked for me after about ten minutes that is the activator open app trigger action seemed to be called at first only from opening the app using the spring board but then later it also worked consistently from the app switcher as well as using lastapp so ymmv i am on a with a minimal tweak list
jailbreak,not_removed,well i tried and use chooseboard to set swiftkey when opening messages and it doesnt work can you explain how you do it
jailbreak,not_removed,we need to stop complaining about complaining and also stop complaining about stopping complaining
jailbreak,not_removed,irony alert
jailbreak,not_removed,wasnt theyre a meta post about this hypocritical much que the bitching people time to vent im personally tired of having my dick touch the toilet water it has got to be a good way to get a disease of some kind damn genetics
jailbreak,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
jailbreak,not_removed,hey man congrats on your tweak release i use forecast meteor to help show my weather will using your tweak make the animations change on my weather icon or lockscreen too
jailbreak,not_removed,just out of curiosity why would you need to spoof the weather
jailbreak,not_removed,does this work with hot as balls
jailbreak,not_removed,lol im gonna go download this tweak sounds sweet
jailbreak,not_removed,could add it
jailbreak,not_removed,just a quick edit i messaged the creator of forecast about adding support so spoofed information also shows up on the lockscreen waiting for a reply
jailbreak,not_removed,just for fun kinda like why have a tweak that shows a pair of balls after a certain temperature because its just for fun
jailbreak,not_removed,living in the central coast of cali i would love to do this the weather here is sunny and every damn day makes some great weather tweaks practically useless
jailbreak,not_removed,leaving a comment
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,that would be so 🆒 pm me your cydia number ill gift you my tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe try her on twitter also angelxwind shes a very busy girl im sure shes the type that gets thousands of emails each day i am not sure but maybe uangelxwind on reddit also
jailbreak,not_removed,for the lols
jailbreak,not_removed,were would one find this tweak for uh scientific purposes
jailbreak,not_removed,sent
jailbreak,not_removed,i hope will try later too
jailbreak,not_removed,hot as balls
jailbreak,not_removed,this issue is because of too many repos
jailbreak,not_removed,ah happened to me too you have jonlucas repo list and youre trying to uninstall it its kinda a pain in the ass first ssh into the phone or open mobile terminal and type these following commands on mobileterminal you must type su and then alpine if youre on ssh you dont have to chmod etc chmod etcapt chmod etcaptsourceslistd now go to etcaptsourceslistd and delete masterrepolist do this via mobileterm ssh or a file browser reboot and rejailbreak uninstall the masterrepo tweak from cydia and it should work your original list of sources should also be restored
jailbreak,not_removed,would chmod work too i think gives too much permissions
jailbreak,not_removed,i think so try it
jailbreak,not_removed,im assuming that you used beta
jailbreak,not_removed,no i am using beta
jailbreak,not_removed,phone works perfectly fine except cydia dont work
jailbreak,not_removed,heard about some issues on the
jailbreak,not_removed,is there a fix to this issue
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont think so
jailbreak,not_removed,damn dude
jailbreak,not_removed,umm i can look into making a tweak for that what type of features are you looking for also do the wives know about each other
jailbreak,not_removed,next week on sister wives uklingonadvocat causes turmoil in the house when he favors one wife over the other by using his iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,😂 title typo its called like better wifi or something edit
jailbreak,not_removed,i have a feeling people are making these typos on purpose
jailbreak,not_removed,hahahah title is amazing 😂 btw you dont need a tweak for your wifi just forget the network you want dont want to make priority and re add it newer wifi get lesser priorities from what ive seen with my experience
jailbreak,not_removed,too much wife not good dude😩😂😂
jailbreak,not_removed,which wife is faster sorry i mean wifi
jailbreak,not_removed,you should only have one wife at a time lmao
jailbreak,not_removed,i want to call bullshit on the error but i laughed so i digress
jailbreak,not_removed,happy to know u have two wifes
jailbreak,not_removed,ummm add one to the favorites of the contact list and not the others just ummm dont let them find your phone
jailbreak,not_removed,call one wife and moan then call the other and scream
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,bruuhh its and im dying over here😂
jailbreak,not_removed,came for the comments was not disappointed
jailbreak,not_removed,this dude pulling mad pussy with all the wives looks like hes got a favorite though
jailbreak,not_removed,i look at the stars
jailbreak,not_removed,wifi priority from the appstore
jailbreak,not_removed,¯ツ¯ 🤣
jailbreak,not_removed,bet
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,ok this one deserves a tag well done sir
jailbreak,not_removed,this cracked me up after a rough time at work tonight happy new year
jailbreak,not_removed,tellmywifiloveher
jailbreak,not_removed,damn two wifis mbn 🤡
jailbreak,not_removed,damn you autocorrect lol
jailbreak,not_removed,lol
jailbreak,not_removed,yes im thinking a big love situation here
jailbreak,not_removed,oh fuck i overlooked that xd thanks for the tweak though
jailbreak,not_removed,holy hell this tweak is what ive been looking for thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,if you have a router that gives of wifis one is something and something i dont remeber the unit but it doesnt matter the is way faster but it doesnt have the range that the does so you can be in range of the but your phone is already connected to the thus missing out on the speed
jailbreak,not_removed,wife the strongest link could not find info about this tweaktheme praise grate god™ type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot

jailbreak,not_removed,😂😂 np
jailbreak,not_removed,the xd just killed it for me
jailbreak,not_removed,go on itunes on a computer purchase a free app itll ask you to sign in do it itll ask you to add a payment method you should be able to select none
jailbreak,not_removed,hello thank you for your participation in rjailbreak however your submission was removed for the following reasons not jailbreak related this should be posted in rios if you have any questions about this removal please feel free to
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,did it work
jailbreak,not_removed,its really late ill try tomorrow
jailbreak,not_removed,isnt ppsync remover used to remove ppsync not appsync
jailbreak,not_removed,is what happens when you dont follow
jailbreak,not_removed,yes you are right
jailbreak,not_removed,you can also use aptget purge to completely uninstall a tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,right now its only for his subscribers i think he said it will be out on the bigboss after a day or two
jailbreak,not_removed,its on a pirate repo but if u wait till tomorrow it will be on the bigboss repo default repo
jailbreak,not_removed,would i have to repay for it
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,im not a developer but i think you should give a little more detail on what this project is
jailbreak,not_removed,you can use activator to build a custom command
jailbreak,not_removed,if you have touch is exactly what you want
jailbreak,not_removed,i believe this package will do what you want set arbitrary wireless mac address on boot httpcydiasaurikcompackagestealthmac you could also make an alias in your bashrcbashprofile but thats a bit more involved
jailbreak,not_removed,u cant anymore
jailbreak,not_removed,you cant apple stopped signing today
jailbreak,not_removed,is no longer being signed you cant update man sorry
jailbreak,not_removed,signing window is closed so you cant upgrade to anymore
jailbreak,not_removed,you cant you left it to late mate unless you saved blobs
jailbreak,not_removed,it doesnt create hot spots you have to already have some type of connection ie wifidata and you can then share that connection with other devices
jailbreak,not_removed,will your carrier charge you to use mywifi
jailbreak,not_removed,pardon my stupidity but doesnt the iphone do that by default personal hotspot
jailbreak,not_removed,it does but some plans dont include tethering especially back when this came out so that option is not available stock on those devices plus this lets you share one paid wifi connection to many other devices
jailbreak,not_removed,it has the ability to create a hotspot but it would depend on your carrier i believe as far as whether you can or not
jailbreak,not_removed,oh i see what you mean thanks bro
jailbreak,not_removed,wait a minute so if i use mywi its actually a paid connection lets say i have bars of active at the airport i dont wanna use data so i turn on mywi and im paying for it like a real hotspot
jailbreak,not_removed,no you would essentially turn your bars of into a wifi hotspot originating from your phone so for example i have a wifi only ipad air as long as i have service on my phone i can use miwi to connect my ipad ubeezure was saying that in some cases you have to buy wifi hotel cruise airplane etc these paid wifi services usually charge by the device so with miwi you could pay once and then stream that connection to many others without paying for the extra devices hope that helped
jailbreak,not_removed,soo just to be clear if i have an unl data plan through my phone but only of hotspot to share when i completely use all of the hotspot then start using mywi itll use my unl data at that point meaning i can still provide a hotspot while i wait for the to restore next month
jailbreak,not_removed,hold on tell me if this will work lets say im on my computer playing csgo when suddenly poof the router blows up however im an gamer so ill stop at nothing to keep playing i turn on my handy mywi wifi feature which is creating the hotspot from my active and i share my mywi wifi connection with the computer will my data plan charge me on both devices and make me pay ridiculous sums of money or only the phone is being charged and i can lay back and keep being a boss
jailbreak,not_removed,yes the scenario you speak of is its primary use if im not mistaken for one reason on another though i feel miwi has lost its demand since most carriers allow more freedom thats probably why there are so few chiming in
jailbreak,not_removed,no it will just be like your phone is using the data but they may throttle you or whatever depending on your data planit will count as data used its is simply a tweak to make your device share your data connection be it another wifi connection or your cell data
jailbreak,not_removed,if you use mywi too much they will know and they will warn you that they know if you use it just the right amount you can continue being a boss and remain undetected
jailbreak,not_removed,first off i dont think that this hypothetical is very good because of how limited the speed will be once tethered from your phone to your computer and lte can be fast but no where near the speed of the hardwired connections sometimes necessary for hardcore online gaming even being connected to a wifi router on the other side of the house would be better than a tethered lte connection ive had trouble streaming videos on youtube while on roadtrips because of weak service in some areas but to answer your usage question if everything you said was possible then you would only be using data from your phones service provider miwi will show data usage in the status bar once connections are made
jailbreak,not_removed,the phone creates the hotspot it uses your data i dont understand the question
jailbreak,not_removed,my question once again will it eat up my data plan if i play csgo on a tethered computer using miwi
jailbreak,not_removed,not my question nonetheless thanks for the reply
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,that is correct stay on ios as long as possible i have seen people talking about possible dual and triple boot of ios and with ios running devices
jailbreak,not_removed,no you cant i wish i were you now
jailbreak,not_removed,that is correct i believe you can jailbreak though
jailbreak,not_removed,you would be correct you can jb your device as it stands but if you update youre going straight to the latest i think and there is no way to go to a lower firmware so you have choices stay where you are and jailbreak or update to the latest firmware and wait for the next jb to be released which no one as of now knows when that may be
jailbreak,not_removed,stay on the on ios is horrible so slow and multitasking sucks
jailbreak,not_removed,is jailbreakable fella is it sexist to assume all people interested in jailbreaking are dudes im on and jb af its not without its bugs but its still awesome i have an unjailbroken iphone on ios debating as to if i should update to the latest ios but would hate for a jb to be released and know that i hosed myself by updating
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah id assume its sexist
jailbreak,not_removed,damnit ok all apologies ms
jailbreak,not_removed,dont worry im a man i was just saying that as a general point
jailbreak,not_removed,i knew it
jailbreak,not_removed,i knew it
jailbreak,not_removed,from which version
jailbreak,not_removed,my baddid u use sep or
jailbreak,not_removed,can some youtuber make a clear tutorial without mistakes its so important for us
jailbreak,not_removed,how long it took you to restore using futurerestore i wait horurs
jailbreak,not_removed,tutorial you followed
jailbreak,not_removed,congrats i also did this on vmware and it was so satisfying when that restoring succeeded showed up
jailbreak,not_removed,how long did it take to go through all of it
jailbreak,not_removed,which ios version which 📱 please clarify so that others can also take the benefits
jailbreak,not_removed,or
jailbreak,not_removed,good for you most are not so lucky
jailbreak,not_removed,on which iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,me too went from to again using sep those saying it took too long the trick is presetting your nonce generator like before restoring set your nonce generator so it immediatly starts restoring
jailbreak,not_removed,sure
jailbreak,not_removed,does touch id work
jailbreak,not_removed,from to using blobs
jailbreak,not_removed,jailbroken or non jailbroken method
jailbreak,not_removed,how much time did you spend on this method its so cool that it worked like a charm

jailbreak,not_removed,terminal said it couldnt fetch the baseband nonce for me still dont know why baseband file shouldve been right and then it said it failed with got put in recovery mode and now here i am stuck on unjailbroken ios rip jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,i have folders noapnonce each contain following files can i use multiple files to speedup the process if yes how many and which onece
jailbreak,not_removed,you had your blobs and did you get the correct baseband file
jailbreak,not_removed,feels like he upgraded to
jailbreak,not_removed,did you have the blobs
jailbreak,not_removed,not sure why this guy doesnt answer you but the dude went from to he did not downgrade

jailbreak,not_removed,could u pls link it
jailbreak,not_removed,link
jailbreak,not_removed,umm what version are you trying to restore from
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,your versión after
jailbreak,not_removed,which tutorial did you follow
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks and yes it was
jailbreak,not_removed,like minutes once i got everything set up
jailbreak,not_removed,ios iphone plus
jailbreak,not_removed,just stayed on the same firmware
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone plus
jailbreak,not_removed,yep
jailbreak,not_removed,search youtube for mac on vmware
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,not that long minutes i pay close attention to details
jailbreak,not_removed,what about linux is this method will run in linux too
jailbreak,not_removed,what happened after it said that
jailbreak,not_removed,download and use ireboot
jailbreak,not_removed,no you would need just you might wanna use the if thats what you wanna restore to
jailbreak,not_removed,restored to it again
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i had my blobs
jailbreak,not_removed,he pmed me
jailbreak,not_removed,if its fail what happen
jailbreak,not_removed,link me too
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,i went from to
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,cool
jailbreak,not_removed,from which version to
jailbreak,not_removed,which tutorial did you follow i havent seen any which is from to
jailbreak,not_removed,can i try this on plus any chances
jailbreak,not_removed,can you please post the link you watched
jailbreak,not_removed,good job so i dont have to care about nounces or anything like that right just have my blobs is enought to successfully restore to ios
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont know actually i tried to use the same method but i ran into an issue on linux well ubuntu
jailbreak,not_removed,it gave me those errors and then said failed to restore and that was it
jailbreak,not_removed,i did but it couldnt get me out of recovery mode
jailbreak,not_removed,just one from any folder or rename one from each folder and use multiple t
jailbreak,not_removed,ok ok so to
jailbreak,not_removed,thats what prometheusfuturerestore are for
jailbreak,not_removed,using prometheus method bro he might have blobs
jailbreak,not_removed,ah ok
jailbreak,not_removed,to
jailbreak,not_removed,this one
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhghonkrvaqcfeatureyoutube
jailbreak,not_removed,has your phone been on
jailbreak,not_removed,wait were you jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,baseband shouldve been
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i had my blobs for
jailbreak,not_removed,😂😂 yeah it go down in the pms
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks a lot mate also do i still have to download if im on
jailbreak,not_removed,is it from to or using jailbroken method
jailbreak,not_removed,httpyoutubehghonkrvaqc this tutorial help you run yosemite niresh version on vmware and virtualbox yosemite version is in science technology views since nov ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
jailbreak,not_removed,im still on ios but i just saved ios blobs
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,the file i used was did yours look like that
jailbreak,not_removed,from which version
jailbreak,not_removed,yes you would need to get the buildmanifest and sep files from zip
jailbreak,not_removed,you may have to find another method unless you can still use ios beta
jailbreak,not_removed,how did you save blobs if you werent on
jailbreak,not_removed,do you still have your blobs
jailbreak,not_removed,when apple still open up ios window the blobs are still alive so i used this link and you could download the shsh blobs on the apple server am i right
jailbreak,not_removed,i did the same and got the same result and yeah i still have my blobs but iphone stuck in recovery mode reiboot isnt working trying to go from
jailbreak,not_removed,do you have xmod installed
jailbreak,not_removed,tmobile uses a vpn to modify your web traffic so it can do things like binge on and music freedom as a result host file tweaks oftentimes will not work on their network those ads are added through a jailbreak tweak i would suggest removing the offending tweak or dealing with the ads
jailbreak,not_removed,no but it was installed on a previous version when i was on last month i guess
jailbreak,not_removed,install stashing from coolstars repo someone already posted a solution on your last post
jailbreak,not_removed,you need coolstars stashing tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,is it me or is jb haunted af im planning to jb now but these posts making me think twice
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah for some reason it reboots the phone you just gotta reopen pangu app but sometimes u gotta do it multiple times
jailbreak,not_removed,mmmkayyyyy
jailbreak,not_removed,op is on a on hence there is no pangu there
jailbreak,not_removed,uatwiiks i know you have a ton of request for horseshoe but please consider this 🙏🏽 thanks for your awesome work ps for anyone asking my control center is flipped because im using a right to left language which andy was awesome enough to add alignment support for
jailbreak,not_removed,how do u have your music the other way round like the artwork is on the right instead of the left and how is there a previous button
jailbreak,not_removed,nobody is interested having the possibility to choose the audio destination it was previously on the second panel and we lost it lets say we have a bluetooth headset and enter in your car now we cant switch from one to another anymore its driving me crazy because i have to uninstall this tweak each time
jailbreak,not_removed,nice concept i like it 🙂
jailbreak,not_removed,love imagine dragons
jailbreak,not_removed,can anyone tell me which repo get horseshoe i cant find it on bigboss
jailbreak,not_removed,hey dude i know its days later but ufrozenpenguintoaster made a tweak for this called his repo is httpsfrozenpenguingithubio
jailbreak,not_removed,drag horseshoe up from bottom and configure settings
jailbreak,not_removed,read my comment
jailbreak,not_removed,new horseshoe update added the rewind button
jailbreak,not_removed,force touch on music area and you get the option to choose audio output
jailbreak,not_removed,that and not having a previous button is why i ditched horseshoe i would have tried it out again now that it has a previous button but i forgot my password and cant get a reply on how to reset it
jailbreak,not_removed,swipe cc up after its showing until you see configure at the bottom make sure air night is on the sections enabled area
jailbreak,not_removed,you downlod atwiiks connect from httpsrepoioscreatixcom buy horseshoe through there and then youll get the repo for it
jailbreak,not_removed,awesome thanks for sharing i didnt know that though it seems to not work correctly for me ill email the dev
jailbreak,not_removed,it only has options to rearrange the sections 😑 how in the hell is this what i asked
jailbreak,not_removed,he means swap sides were the album art is like im going to ask mines on the left
jailbreak,not_removed,this☝🏽️ though it seems you have an se so you can use peekaboo
jailbreak,not_removed,me either i finished by buying it again but unfortunately not being able to choose the audio destination prevent me from using it on the long term
jailbreak,not_removed,the air night section doesnt have the audio output only airdrop i really need the audio output switch thanks for this nice tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,oh it cant be bought through cydia thats unusual thanks but i think ill pass
jailbreak,not_removed,i havent tried it yet so i apologize ill keep an eye out
jailbreak,not_removed,relax just trying to help
jailbreak,not_removed,its reddit what do you expect
jailbreak,not_removed,same here
jailbreak,not_removed,unfortunately peek a boo doesnt work on my se on
jailbreak,not_removed,thats a nice addition but i done want to install a whole touch tweak just for that one feature ah well
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks i really need this too
jailbreak,not_removed,the developer stated the next major update will be available on bigboss
jailbreak,not_removed,he replied to my email and fixed it works perfect 👌🏽
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry didnt mean to come off rude
jailbreak,not_removed,gotta be photoshopped that no settings to change it to right side
jailbreak,not_removed,ive gotten it to wok but its such a bad implementation it isnt usable
jailbreak,not_removed,you can download airplay flipswitch on bigboss repo
jailbreak,not_removed,try what small parrot suggested it works
jailbreak,not_removed,good to hear thank you getting it now i might recommend editing your top comment so that the tweak can be visible this comment thread is too far buried
jailbreak,not_removed,no problem my fault i didnt read it right so were both to blame
jailbreak,not_removed,he is using a right to left language that causes it its a feature
jailbreak,not_removed,small parrot
jailbreak,not_removed,download airplay flipswitch the airplay button shortcut that you can add on the control center with flipcontrolcenter will now let you choose the audio destination works on my side very well
jailbreak,not_removed,i was wondering about that long time ago basically change app volume independently from other apps
jailbreak,not_removed,activator anywhere build application launch choose app then go to anywhere find the event you just created for the action you can choose to set volume to of maximum edit nm read your whole post this will just set the system volume
jailbreak,not_removed,i take it you havent heard of anything that does this
jailbreak,not_removed,nah although i cant jb right now see flair i definetly need this when i can agian some time
jailbreak,not_removed,dang that sucks hopefully conditions improve in both cases
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe this and helps you
jailbreak,not_removed,ive had volume mixer for a while it just allows you to change output volumes which can be changed anyway just by unpluggingplugging in the devices that correspond with that setting thanks anyway though i appreciate the effort
jailbreak,not_removed,ok still waiting for something like this but only for the apps instead of the devices to change independently
jailbreak,not_removed,forecast
jailbreak,not_removed,lock plus or lockhtml with the stripe widget would be exactly what youre looking for you can also disable the animated weather in forecast and if you really dont like or want to see it
jailbreak,not_removed,battery drains
jailbreak,not_removed,i second lock plus mine looks like this
jailbreak,not_removed,every lockscreen tweak i install causes boot in safe mode
jailbreak,not_removed,yea if you have your weather update every minute
jailbreak,not_removed,hell yeah man lock plus was solely responsible for bringing back the novelty of jailbreaking for me when i found donated and installed it nice ls by the way that set up is right in line with my tastes i love that the lock app allows you to edit other set ups right from your device
jailbreak,not_removed,you must have an incompatibility somewhere then because i have not only lock plus installed but lockhtml colorbanners watchnotifications priorityhub hidemex romanpasscode and sleekcode all running on my lockscreen and have no issues at all
jailbreak,not_removed,ya i have it set for every minutes on my and no battery issues there and i even have the animated lock screen on
jailbreak,not_removed,exactly
jailbreak,not_removed,no there is no way currently to downgrade devices right now you can still back up your shsh blobs with tinyumbrellacom but you cant downgrade to backup your tweaks and preferences you can use something like or
jailbreak,not_removed,bigboss utilities a complete backup tool httpcydiasaurikcompackagecompragmatixconsultingpackagebackup bigboss utilities backup restore all your cydia packages bleep boop im a bot type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i currently only work with default repos i also reply to pms httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for the reply i saw cydia eraser mentioned in some downgrade thread i came across will it help me stay on the same jailbreakable few
jailbreak,not_removed,yes it wipes the device but leaves the ios version the same
jailbreak,not_removed,although you must remember if its a brand new made device and it never had a ota cydia easer i believe will not work for it not that it matters now but it did i believe back in the iphone se
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i think it was released like today its still an early version and the imessage quick replies dont work yet on applebetas repo httpsrepoapplebetastk
jailbreak,not_removed,classicbanners could not find info about this tweaktheme eta son™ type the name of a tweak or theme enclosed in double brackets and ill look it up for you i also reply to pms i currently only work with default repos please do not reply to this comment the person who requested me will not see your reply httpwwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobot httpsgithubcomhizinfiztweakinfobot httpswwwredditcomrhizinfizwikitweakinfobotwikieditingcomments
jailbreak,not_removed,thats my mistake for not reading carefully yeah then i havent seen a tweak that does that sorry
jailbreak,not_removed,i think i saw someone request this like last week but didnt really get any attention
jailbreak,not_removed,update itunes to current connect to itunes click restore iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,you can just do a normal itunes restore if you want
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks i wasnt sure if that was the right way or not ah should i remove my cydia tweaks and if so how
jailbreak,not_removed,mkay thanks for the help
jailbreak,not_removed,cheers
jailbreak,not_removed,nah youre fine
jailbreak,not_removed,i did it anyway aha
jailbreak,not_removed,hahaha definitely doesnt hurt but it wasnt needed
jailbreak,not_removed,its probably mostly a matter of devs having an ipad to test on
jailbreak,not_removed,iphone didnt work just got weird u shaped symbols
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work iphone ll shaped symbols
jailbreak,not_removed,not working for me iphone plus its shows weird letters and shapes instead of the new emojis
jailbreak,not_removed,gentlemen we all just fucked ourselves
jailbreak,not_removed,same here
jailbreak,not_removed,same
jailbreak,not_removed,is it the one that shows emoji ios backup d
jailbreak,not_removed,got it it worked for me
jailbreak,not_removed,if youre looking for stability night shift and and easier to hide your jailbreak useful for genius appointment imo then why not bear in mind that you cant downgrade back
jailbreak,not_removed,yes much more stable lots of tweaks are compatible too
jailbreak,not_removed,couldnt i save my shsh blobs
jailbreak,not_removed,even if you can theres no possible way to downgrade bit devices yet and theres no way to downgrade back to ios kpp
jailbreak,not_removed,go to icloudcom and sign in click find my iphone then click on your bootloop device click erase once cydia eraser gets updated use it because icloud erasing is bad but work like a charm to get out of boot loops
jailbreak,not_removed,why why why anything which installs unsigned apps includes appsync this is just a watered down version
jailbreak,not_removed,to reboot on an iphone hold down the power and home button
jailbreak,not_removed,give him a break hes a beginner probably
jailbreak,not_removed,the only thing is theres going to be a lot of problems i can help you fix but its better than no jailbreak at all
jailbreak,not_removed,read my other comment on the page
jailbreak,not_removed,removing xmod worked for me
jailbreak,not_removed,hey could you guide me on how to do this please
jailbreak,not_removed,happy to help
jailbreak,not_removed,was it the xmhelperdylib
jailbreak,not_removed,weird when i tap on the icon this is what i see am i missing something
jailbreak,not_removed,ahh thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,happened to me in the app store last week too kinda panicked a bit but nothing has happened since
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont think pirate tweaks do this this has happened to me even when im not jail broken just quit the app and clear your cache or use icleaner
jailbreak,not_removed,this only happens to me with ifunny app im jailbroken on and dont have pirated tweaks or sources
jailbreak,not_removed,xmodgames pirated tweaks etc can cause this
jailbreak,not_removed,hmmm onlinemobileadsonline i wonder if thats on the internet
jailbreak,not_removed,so this is a problem with other people 🤔🤔
jailbreak,not_removed,its just a javascript alert window probably trying to scam people treat it like any other ad and just ignore it
jailbreak,not_removed,are you fucking kidding me
jailbreak,not_removed,so stop using it shits just week old rfunny anyways youre not missing anything
jailbreak,not_removed,aight ill peep that subreddit
jailbreak,not_removed,try and give these guys a call if it can be done im sure they can httpswwwrossmanngroupcom go watch their youtube repair videos they know what theyre doing
jailbreak,not_removed,you can use a tool from i believe to do it yourself but you need the proper equipment and know how if anyone has a place i can get the flash kit please let me know as i want to do this with my phones but i just have no idea where to get the proper equipment
jailbreak,not_removed,that guy was examined by linustechtips and he has the skill to know what hes doing especially since he has his own reballing and soldering hardware but im quite sure he couldnt just solder on new storage chips to your current iphone mainboard and expand the capacity since its more involved than that the company in china that actually does this also has to write back your old nand data to the new chips once soldered on to the board and perform a tweak or six so that the phone detects that there is more storage onboard after the upgrade it makes me wonder how they can do all of that without jailbreaking your device but it looks like its possible even without a way of gaining root access and modifying the flash storage size the opposite also holds true to me as wellmakes you wonder if people that know how to do this would take a iphone and use their software to make it show up like it has of internal storage when it still has the old nand installed it would definitely make the phone sell for more money than for a base model device
jailbreak,not_removed,yes but thats not exactly an internal storage swap which is what that article i linked is
jailbreak,not_removed,so far no unlike a battery swap this takes actual equipment to transfer info from one ssd to the other not just because of apps
jailbreak,not_removed,damn yea looking also and all im seeing is the one from shenzhen market
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah i cant believe its not available here yet especially in ios saturated markets like nyc and la
jailbreak,not_removed,i live in la there are some places but not as cheap as in china
jailbreak,not_removed,where im in la
jailbreak,not_removed,have you heard of the santee alley

jailbreak,not_removed,activator has default bypass feature when you select app to open with activator trigger click the i info icon and select unlock immediately instead of ask for passcode
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i already know i am asking about a tweak that takes you to the springboard
jailbreak,not_removed,probably not but give it a try
jailbreak,not_removed,step glitch is server side
jailbreak,not_removed,i would say try it lol
jailbreak,not_removed,the new update completely removed the steps lol
jailbreak,not_removed,does your friend care about jailbreak if not can you trade him
jailbreak,not_removed,mine has hiss gate so i only need to go to the apple store lol
jailbreak,not_removed,its super time consuming and risky might not work for me jailbreak isnt that important but thats just me you might be better waiting to see if theres a jailbreak for ios
jailbreak,not_removed,do something record with a and at the same time in a room with no noise if you hear the hissing noise popular on iphone playing on the background of the video thats you perfect excuse not need to risk it with usb killer i changed my iphone plus like times because of the same problem on purpose of course because it doesnt get fix
jailbreak,not_removed,ahh forgot about those situations
jailbreak,not_removed,usb killer actually reverses the power flow overloading the lightning port and redirecting it into the motherboard specifically into the processor or at least thats what it does on pc i imagine the same on mobile
jailbreak,not_removed,unfortunately hes still paying on the device so cant trade
jailbreak,not_removed,hiss gate whats that
jailbreak,not_removed,ohhhh hm interesting ive gotta try this now im curious
jailbreak,not_removed,i cant see any replacement from apple coming on though i was aiming to get a replacement through the carrier
jailbreak,not_removed,apple actually had protection built in it only fries the lightening port
jailbreak,not_removed,its a hissing noise inside the phone record a video with your any other model that is not the in the same room in silence and you will see the difference
jailbreak,not_removed,believe me it works 👍🏼 sometimes the give you a bit of a headache blaming it on a software issue and saying that may get fix in the future with a new update but just insist and theyll exchange it if you bring the videos to show the true its easier
jailbreak,not_removed,its hard to get it nowadays the last time i tried getting and i had to exchanged it like times s this was weeks ago
jailbreak,not_removed,huh only audible when recording super quiet scenes i dont think ive noticed it listening to average to loud volume recordings recordings ive made
jailbreak,not_removed,right yeah i havent tested this so i dont know if im affected happy with my device and jailbreak in most respects so im not looking to return it unless this is a serious issue that could actually be fixed by getting a replacement device in which case id have to weigh the hassle of doing all that versus the severity of the issue
jailbreak,not_removed,how did you exchange it times
jailbreak,not_removed,update got to the apple store a few hours ago they gave me a new iphone with ios but not because of the hiss gate they say thats normal because it rebooted times without asking or something
jailbreak,not_removed,believe me unfortunately you have it all the and i believe the have it but its not sometime you really hear a lot specially if its a normal video outside you will just hear it inside a quiet room and it just covers like or percent of the background audio is not a big deal but yeah even me i have it but jlbrk is jlbrk lol
jailbreak,not_removed,same way as the other lol using the hissing noise excuse
jailbreak,not_removed,huh cool more stable jb for you if you were on before
jailbreak,not_removed,interesting apple store or carrier
jailbreak,not_removed,also have they ever mentioned how many times youve had your device replaced
jailbreak,not_removed,i was on so better than nothing no jb available for on
jailbreak,not_removed,i live in montreal canada somy carrier is fido and there is stores here ive done it in all of them lol and actually i always mention it before they could see it i find that like that they see it more as an im getting annoyed by doing this to many times and they dont say anything after it
jailbreak,not_removed,oh right maybe a jailbreak sometime
jailbreak,not_removed,bro mine actually has the hissing noise
jailbreak,not_removed,there you have it thats your perfect excuse to exchange your iphone with no problems because its a problem that came from factory
jailbreak,not_removed,whats the best way to go about it like what exactly do you say to the employees at the store
jailbreak,not_removed,normally i show them the problem with two videos recorded previously with a your in the same quiet room that is the best way to go show them your problem and have your phone updated to the latest ios that makes it faster tell them that the problem just happens when it records with the builtin mic no when you connect an external one tell them that you would like to fix it and they will tell you that they will give you a new one because technically there is no fix
jailbreak,not_removed,just got my replacement order placed wish me luck last one i got was ish weeks ago and was
jailbreak,not_removed,damn thats crazy lol i usually get them on or
jailbreak,not_removed,i live in east us if that matters but yeah im really hoping to hit that magic number if not a different tmobile store will be seeing me soon 😂
jailbreak,not_removed,hahahaha well it may make a difference im in canada haha if you have apple care then just go to the apple store its more simple but anyways good luck man and happy the advise helped
jailbreak,not_removed,thats actually why i went through the carrier bc it seems their replacement devices have a pretty old stock seeing as how i got a and all but yeah man thanks again ill comment again when i get the phone 😂
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah thats a good point can play against or on your favor lets hope it works out for you take care man let me know your luck haha

jailbreak,not_removed,should be okay if you go long distances itll softban you my map wigged out and instead of taking me down the street to a local park it took me cities over i let it run its course and it was on speed i got a softban for like minutes wasnt too bad but it can happen
jailbreak,not_removed,i try not to use it for spoofing its a good replacement for the nearby list so i mainly use it for that
jailbreak,not_removed,is the jailbreak breaking the new app update because i cant seem to log on
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah the main thing is that i dont want to end up in a gps spoofing banwave in the future because of one screwup and im hoping they dont have some serverside detection for hacking apps

jailbreak,not_removed,try xcon flex nosub or tsprotector

jailbreak,not_removed,exercise caution with this tweak i just analyzed the contents of the deb file hosted on urishanans repo and discovered that nothing has been modified since december my local time and that was only the debian control file the rest of his crack consists of some random blizzard game assets like lefteyeregressorbin mouthregressorbin etc and bits and pieces of another developers tweak minimal hosts blocker i think he added the blizzard files to make the file size seem large like there was a lot of code contained in it nbsp please see for more information about rishanans tweaks from another dev who did some analysis nbsp i havent looked at the ipas he hosted but considering the evidence of fraud in his sac package i have doubts that there is anything of value there nbsp sidenote i have never criticized another devs work or anybody else here on rjailbreak and i feel sad to call urishanan out but i feel strongly that it is the right thing to do for our community with that said it is of course your choice to install this packagebut just know that it isnt what was advertised edit here is a screenshot of the files contained in the deb hosted on his repobe sure to look at the date modified column as well as the file names httpimgurcomanowxi edit rishanans response to this post prompted me to download and look at the ipa hes hosting on his github repo guess what its an unmodified stock snapchat ipa file version compiled on december
jailbreak,not_removed,seems fancy and all but snap phantom lite works well does pretty much everything people want need lol and considering that he isnt even supporting the full phantom tweak anymore i dont think its a good idea to recommend it also you might as well call the full version of snap unsupported as well lol considering there working on there own lite version too i wont say your method doesnt work or anything but i will say that this is pretty useless tbh p
jailbreak,not_removed,a pretty big tutorial isnt it
jailbreak,not_removed,lol
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont see what all the controversy is ive used this before and it worked with no issues but it sad because i was just about to use this but then it got deleted rip
jailbreak,not_removed,this sounds like a crazily amazing thing but i just have three question does this app let you see our credentials or is this completely automated through the app while its running will we be able to update the app after the crack and why does it take so long to complete edit i completely flew past the part where you download the official app my bad
jailbreak,not_removed,damn im going to do this in the morning and thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,like he said dont use it if ya dont trust it
jailbreak,not_removed,i can assure you it works
jailbreak,not_removed,love your work for exposing this loser props to you mate
jailbreak,not_removed,should i be frightened for having installed neverlowermusic on my se and i really hope not i uninstalled both of them arghhhhhhh i really really hope not
jailbreak,not_removed,so i get some bits of minimal hosts blocker and some random blizzard files sign me up
jailbreak,not_removed,dude get a life sac is just to assist the patch from working in the ipa if you want to post whatever make sure you have tested everything and when its not working then say something like this till then keep your bs analysis to yourself because you dont prove shit till you show me that this is not working👍🏾
jailbreak,not_removed,i will not be able to see any of youre credentials it will be sent to snapchat for update as always wait for me to update itt the nature of the attack that has to be slow
jailbreak,not_removed,my pleasure
jailbreak,not_removed,then dont have to use not begging you to download twda
jailbreak,not_removed,why do you want to limit yourself when you can reach for the sky
jailbreak,not_removed,in the end the users can decide for themselves like i said but in the meantime they have a right to know i posted a screenshot of the contents of your deb file explain what the blizzard assets are even there for and why there havent been any changes besides the control file on december
jailbreak,not_removed,how about you get people to back u up then you can claim your tweak works
jailbreak,not_removed,ah cool also dont you think snapchat will find out about this
jailbreak,not_removed,im not going to lie i laughed so hard to this
jailbreak,not_removed,im sure they will not be able to patch anytime soon trust me
jailbreak,not_removed,its in the post but there are some features in the full version that are not in the lite version some of which is quite useful
jailbreak,not_removed,alright sounds great
jailbreak,not_removed,to give you a heads up dont use this probably fakemalwarecrap
jailbreak,not_removed,with this you are undetected by the server and they will not able to check for any hooks or what so ever
jailbreak,not_removed,its some vulnerability in their server and app communication but only works after hours
jailbreak,not_removed,youre welcome 😬

jailbreak,not_removed,clock is not showing in the status bar of the lockscreen by defaulteven if no music is playing lockhtml have an option to show it
jailbreak,not_removed,nicky t is one of the most underrated mcs out there bay area legend though i love seeing people know of him
jailbreak,not_removed,yeah but i dont want to have my clock on the status bar shown all the time its kinda weird having my lockscreen clock and statusbar clock together
jailbreak,not_removed,def underrated but its a shame he has great talent but its good hes not mainstream either or we would have never seen cocaine raps xd
jailbreak,not_removed,try you dont need it in the status bar when you can still have it in the normal spot
jailbreak,not_removed,if you press the home button i assume you dont have lockhtmlxen installed it will show a big clock o
jailbreak,not_removed,i do have lockhtml thats the problem
jailbreak,not_removed,have you tried spotlight search
jailbreak,not_removed,do you have installed preferenceloader give it a try
jailbreak,not_removed,ok sry i had to install it manually i have no clue about your springboard problem
jailbreak,not_removed,yathey dont show up
jailbreak,not_removed,it is also installedit came by default i guess
jailbreak,not_removed,in icleaner there is an option to disable tweak preference bundles individually so they arent loaded in settings go to the tab and choose preference bundles then try disabling the tweaks individually and see if disabling one of them fixes your problem

jailbreak,not_removed,i thought with apple stopped beep sound when invoking siri by pressing home button beep sound only there if headphones are attached and if you activate siri by hey siri you guys sure if this is not the case when ppl complaning not getting any sound when home button is pressed
jailbreak,not_removed,i installed the new version and enabled the theme after installing the fix no difference siri works just fine but this theme has done nothing for me no effect
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work for me
jailbreak,not_removed,i install jarvis fix but my siri is always brick
jailbreak,not_removed,i cant repair my siri after this even with jarvifix siri still silenced and i cant say nothing even in nonjb mode
jailbreak,not_removed,i unistalled installed jarvisfix that prompted me to unistall jarvisfix now still no beep sound when siri is invoked works fine when invoked by headphones but does not work when home button is pressed also applying jarvis via anemone doesnt work
jailbreak,not_removed,also not working has zero effect soon as i reboot it puts me into safe mode this really blows maybe should of taken your time with this tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,so theres nothing positive or anyone saying its working
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work for me activated the theme but the voice is normal
jailbreak,not_removed,installed the theme enabled it but no change to siris voice on iphone se
jailbreak,not_removed,i installed and when applied with anemone i rebooted and the voice never changed i was a bit upset i couldnt get it to work but fine but upon uninstalling my siri would stay on the ask me anything screen i wasnt able to ask questions and tapping on the microphone did nothing so i installed fix rebooted again and the problem persisted i still have yet to find a fix after a week can anyone elaborate on this thanks edit i found the fix add and install originalsirisounds then reboot fixed
jailbreak,not_removed,is there anyway to get it in spanish
jailbreak,not_removed,please elaborate i cant help you if you dont tell me what isnt working
jailbreak,not_removed,same for me were you able to fix it if so could you let me know how thanks edit add and install originalsirisounds and reboot fixed
jailbreak,not_removed,same for me did you happen to find a fix or is it still broken edit add and install originalsirisounds and reboot fixed
jailbreak,not_removed,huh its been like that since the first beta apple deliberately removed the beep sound on stock
jailbreak,not_removed,its either should have or shouldve but never should of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
jailbreak,not_removed,well this doesnt hook substrate so this isnt the cause if your safe mode looks like you have some other problem on your hands
jailbreak,not_removed,it worked great for me on the but saddly not on the nor the
jailbreak,not_removed,does jarvis speak spanish
jailbreak,not_removed,siri is just normal i installed the theme and activate it but its still the normal voice
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you so much ive had a bricked siri for a couple months this is the only thing that worked
jailbreak,not_removed,it worked but now i just check it no
jailbreak,not_removed,so if it is like that why so many people complaining about not having sound when siri is invoked by pressing home button so jarvis should only work then when headphones are connected or when invoked by hey siri im confused
jailbreak,not_removed,i thought i was the only what a relief toot edit i cant understand people not realising the huge difference between of and ve ps were going to be trashed lol
jailbreak,not_removed,of course d avengers and iron man movies are translated in many languages
jailbreak,not_removed,same isnt working iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,no problem dude glad i could help
jailbreak,not_removed,thats what its been like for me i just use the hey siri to invoke it
jailbreak,not_removed,ill take a look at it sometime
jailbreak,not_removed,did you check the yalu app to see if youre jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,i have another issue in cydia when i click an option nothing happens the option just turns dark for example when i click manage account it just turns dark
jailbreak,not_removed,nope i just restarted my phone and tried jailbreaking it again and this time it worked
jailbreak,not_removed,saurik is already working on cydia beta you can try it from your repo but i recommend waiting for it to finish
jailbreak,not_removed,this is a semitethered jailbreak so youll need to rejailbreak after every reboot
jailbreak,not_removed,all you did is restart your phone and hit go again
jailbreak,not_removed,yes this has been discussed many times on this sub the last few weeks
jailbreak,not_removed,yup
jailbreak,not_removed,ive been doing every combination of restartrebootrejailbreak i can imaginecydia still crashing for me every time i guess ill try it like times and see if that works

jailbreak,not_removed,appsync 😂
jailbreak,not_removed,u should uninstall that tweak when u can open cydia
jailbreak,not_removed,im in a similar situation i dont have many tweaks installed i cant enter jailbroken state it happened right after i respringed using the respring bug that already exists on ios the one opening a notification center and then tapping the search bar did you do the same if you find a solution would you tell me edit nevermind i deleted yalu and reinstalled it now it works and im back on jailbroken mode
jailbreak,not_removed,
jailbreak,not_removed,did you install appsync
jailbreak,not_removed,no it was not appsync but i dont remember what it was
jailbreak,not_removed,it has most definitely died down but some say winter is coming dont get to comfortable and make sure you are using the bypass
jailbreak,not_removed,use phantom since i jailbroke months ago no ban yet
jailbreak,not_removed,what is the bypass called
jailbreak,not_removed,it literally doesnt matter what you use people have been banned on both sides and there have been people that havent been banned on both sides it doesnt matter what tweak youre using it matters how youre using it
jailbreak,not_removed,sac bypass from the repo httprishanangithubio
jailbreak,not_removed,all i was doing was saving pics and posting gallery pics and i got banned i have to go into safe mode to use snapchat as i cant access it from my jailbroken state any help with that
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont think it is behavior wise ive been using both phantom and snap extensively and didnt got banned i used it in combination with autotouch to send snaps to mass gain points like a day save photos videos i even uploaded videos of hour a couple of times
jailbreak,not_removed,delete snapchat and reinstall it and relogin that fixed it for me
jailbreak,not_removed,it wasnt exactly confirmed but basically came to conclusion it was it was things like location faking having a snap loaded for too long marking a newer one as read before an older one stuff along those lines
jailbreak,not_removed,nope
jailbreak,not_removed,im in a new continent with location faker like everyday so cant be that has to be something else
jailbreak,not_removed,it doesnt work with

jailbreak,not_removed,np man
jailbreak,not_removed,you go please let me know if that works
jailbreak,not_removed,you sir madam are officially super awesome i replaced the file rebooted rejailbroke and it seems to be working
jailbreak,not_removed,i had that issue and i had to cydia erased my iphone good for you and i am sir btw you are welcome
jailbreak,not_removed,you installed nomusicvolumelow too took me a while to figure out what it was im happy now that i didnt had the time yet to reset my phone though it was a pretty annoying weeks thanks again for your help
jailbreak,not_removed,i installed a similar tweak its was the when was still signed so i dnt remember the name exactly but i never figured out what happened at that time now i will be careful thank to you too
jailbreak,not_removed,great more speculation here we go again this serves no purpose at all
jailbreak,not_removed,what no option
jailbreak,not_removed,if anyone wants to add their vote here is the link
jailbreak,not_removed,to be honest im just waiting to see idk what the fighting is about its real or not if it is they will release before a month if not then we have no jailbreak and they are not real
jailbreak,not_removed,update to latest itunes make sure your usb drive on computer is working properly if not its most likely your cord doubt its a hardware defect on the iphone
jailbreak,not_removed,i used to have errors like this back in the day when all else failed trying on a different computer or different user account seemed to work
jailbreak,not_removed,you can almost always reflash to a previous firmware or you can always restore the version of the firmware youre on there are no signing windows or blobsap ticketsnonces to worry about
jailbreak,not_removed,imo exploits are readily released on android because the devs bank on android oems laziness to update their softwares another point worth mentioned is that once a firmware got cracked open theres no way the oem can force update to a patched firmware theres no servercheck signing bs whenever u have to factory reset your devices unofficial bootloader unlock aint no easy task these days for android either so dont make light of android security
jailbreak,not_removed,ahh i see and makes a bit more sense to me so how does a team pangu know when it would be wise to drop all their exploits so that we can benefit i admire that apple wants every single security hole patched up and i really have grown to respect that but at the same time i would like to tweak my phone theres so many little things about ios for me that make it harder to switch to android not being able to test betas and come home to a jailbreak is the worst but when i have an android phone i flash roms every other day that always got on my nerves even though thats what i like doing someone said it before that jb tweaks hook into apps or frameworks or whatever so jailbreaking has a lot of advantages like i love instagram and i dont need to flash a mod on android to get those features
jailbreak,not_removed,as answered jailbreaking isnt easy but its not that part which makes it valuable instead its apples odd obsession on patching every exploit available odd because even though its the right thing to do apple wasnt like that a few years ago this makes the developers hardwork go to trash if not released on the correct moment as apple can just simply reverse engineer the tool and create the patch for a jailbreak a great example for which is the ios untether not many can utilise since the os is unsigned already edit as you can see my flair says i am using beta and yes i always drop my jailbreak for a beta test it for a month or so and decide wether to keep my phone jailbroken or updated
jailbreak,not_removed,i honestly appreciate everybodys responses i knew jailbreaking was a very difficult process to begin with now im understanding exactly why developers are reluctant to share their exploits i understand that we all would love a jail break and when we see somebody like stefan or luco i think thats his name showing off a jailbreak the community will get upset well some will get upset not all i never realized how much goes into creating a successful untethered jb and now i see why it would be a bad idea for apple to give the option to let us jb freely seriously i have learned a good amount of information from everybody
jailbreak,not_removed,its easy you dont have to worry about unlocking the boot rom or whatever you hit jailbreak and boom
jailbreak,not_removed,i know this may never happen but do you guys think apple will come to their senses and offer consumers a jailbreak option like how some android vendors will offer the tools to officially unlock their bootloader but let the user know hey if you do this your warranty is history
jailbreak,not_removed,short answer jailbreaking is a lot harder there is no devicefirmware fragmentation we are up against a single software vendor and hardware manufacturer and that entity is determined to make its products impenetrable even to its customers
jailbreak,not_removed,how does a team know when to drop their exploits they dont theres no hard and fast rule its become a tactical game with how keen apple are to patch everything ship newer devices with new firmware and have zero possibility of downgrading generally it seems that a good time to release a jailbreak is when a new devicefirmware combo comes out so that devices bought new can be jailbroken out of the box at other times its so bad that people only release their exploits after apple independently patch them in recent updates which is why all jailbreakers stay on outdated firmware the jailbreak was released way after it became impossible to update to only because pangu was given the exploit by someone else
jailbreak,not_removed,they dont really do it for our benefit theyre paid by big companies to do what theyre doing
jailbreak,not_removed,apple has always patched vulnerabilities its just the speed at which apple does this now is faster
jailbreak,not_removed,never
jailbreak,not_removed,never never ever ever why do you think they made a big deal about resisting the fbi trying to crack an iphone i mean id like if they did it i had an xperia play and sony let you officially unlock the bootloader so i could flash doomkernel on it but apple super duper mega ultra care about security its why people say ios and iphones are so much more secure than android phones on average if you manage to steal an iphone and its password locked and icloud locked that thing is a complete paperweight
jailbreak,not_removed,ios uniformity doesnt make it harder to crack on the contrary a bunch of brilliant motivated devs working on a single platforms on same hardwares bound to yield good results jailbreakers only seem to be fighting a losing battle simply because of apples perseverance for security and probably financially driven since exploits are worth a lot of money and therefore never make it to become jailbreak to the general public
jailbreak,not_removed,well the reason i say that is because iphone os ios and are left vulnerable of jailbreak but the ios and isnt
jailbreak,not_removed,jailbreakers only seem to be fighting a losing battle simply because of apples perseverance for security exactly apparently i was unclear im not saying that the mere fact that there is a single entity making the hardware and software decisions makes jailbreaking harder im saying that when that entity is hellbent on control it makes breaking that control more difficult
jailbreak,not_removed,did you install upscale
jailbreak,not_removed,boot into no substrate mode vol up when pressing go on yalu then uninstall the tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,dev of springplus here has the issue been solved
jailbreak,not_removed,nope
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you for your help as well
jailbreak,not_removed,yes it has thank you
jailbreak,not_removed,try ssh over usb and removing mobile substrate
jailbreak,not_removed,was there a problem with springplus
jailbreak,not_removed,can you give me a guide on how to do that ive never encountered such a problem any guide ive seen from google seems outdated
jailbreak,not_removed,just brilliant ur dedication is remarkable this just made me install ur ad blocker cause it shows me how dedicated u are to ur work which gains my trustthank you
jailbreak,not_removed,download ifunbox connect device go to quick toolbox open usb tunnel detect and create then download putty make the host and port then login as root password alpine then type aptget remove mobilesubstrate
jailbreak,not_removed,i always give my
jailbreak,not_removed,okay so i opened usb tunnel but it says no opening port on ios is detected
jailbreak,not_removed,are you in jailbroken mode
jailbreak,not_removed,okay i dont know how but i managed to get into safe mode and unistall a bunch of tweaks i couldnt get into it before and i know i was pressing down on volume up i managed to get back in my jailbreak that was a scare for me i appreciate your help honestly thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,well good job dude
jailbreak,not_removed,i came here late but glad you got it sorted mate i was getting nervous for you just reading the thread
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you and thank you for your help regardless
jailbreak,not_removed,haha i was nervous the entire time trying not to freak out about the possibility of losing my precious jailbreak but thanks wouldve sucked having to use stock ios only reason i even keep an iphone is because of jailbreaking
jailbreak,not_removed,anytime enjoy your jailbreak you deserve it
jailbreak,not_removed,what you could try is using cydia impactor to reinstall the jailbreak my phone would automatically close the pangu jb app when i went to rejailbreak my phone and wouldnt work after plugging my phone in to charge i went ahead and opened impactor dragged the file i think its an ipa file or something i forget to impactor and after it was done the app launched successfully and i was able to rejailbreak you might consider backing your phone up before rejailbreaking i lost some neat photos and texts haha
jailbreak,not_removed,did this happen after you installed a tweak
jailbreak,not_removed,close all apps turn on airplane mode open pangupp app tap button and lock device
jailbreak,not_removed,finally got mine back to working follow these steps step first and foremost turn off the device so its entirely powered down step now power on the device using the power button on the device making sure to hold down the volume up button on the side of the device as part of the boot up process when apple logo appears let go of the power button but continue to hold the volume up button when the lock screen appears let go of this button too step open the app switcher by double pressing the hometouch id button on the device close all of the open apps by swiping up on them to remove them from the background step now launch the pp jailbreak helper app and follow the usual instructions to put your device back into jailbroken mode here rejailbreak pangu pp on ios after reboot heres how
jailbreak,not_removed,do you have a link to a tutorial
jailbreak,not_removed,no i received a text and my phone froze up so i hard reset it i was able to download the pg client all from the appstore and i tried running it with that as well should i delete the pangu app and use the pg client and see if that works im worried i wont be able to get the pangu app back
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work
jailbreak,not_removed,i dont i just tried it out you should be able to find the download links in the how to thread or by searching the sub for cydia impactor download you should also find the ipa download in the same post or from pangus site run impactor make sure it detects your iphone drag drop the ipa file into impactor youll need to enter your apple id and password you can create and use a fake account if you want let impactor finish close impactor try to jailbreak your device and see if it works
jailbreak,not_removed,no harm in trying but i think you shouldnt delete the pangu app
jailbreak,not_removed,just tried this method and did not work the device just reboots into a non jailbroken state and i dont receive a notification from the app every time
jailbreak,not_removed,the pg client app just doesnt work at all when locking my device im not going to delete the pp app
jailbreak,not_removed,if you do find a working solution please post it
jailbreak,not_removed,the pg client needs to download a lot of stuff before you can jailbreak
jailbreak,not_removed,nothing has worked so far guess im not jailbroken anymore i have all of my cydia apps but they all crash and the jailbreak pangu app just resprings and nothing happens feelsbadman
jailbreak,not_removed,didnt work either it just redo rings my device and doesnt give me the notification
jailbreak,not_removed,you may have to factory reset your phone to rejailbreak also if you rejailbreak install cydia eraser and run it to ensure no trace of cydia is left that way nothing will interfere with future jailbreak attempts
jailbreak,not_removed,do not disturb turned off
jailbreak,not_removed,it is off
jailbreak,not_removed,sorry bro i dont know what to do
jailbreak,not_removed,just downgrade with app admin
jailbreak,not_removed,its such a horrible update what on earth were they thinking sticking two tabs in the middle of an address book
jailbreak,not_removed,check this out or if you want it tweaked
jailbreak,not_removed,may have to do that its such a disfunctional update just when they get the app pretty much perfect in my opinion they do this
jailbreak,not_removed,what version is good
jailbreak,not_removed,ive done this but update the last before they implemented the change just crashes on startup now

jailbreak,not_removed,this doesnt work for me did you get it to work
jailbreak,not_removed,again repeated shit ton of times amazon is not coming back to cydia
jailbreak,not_removed,in addition to what johnny said saurik has stated that he has to do business with people that he knows are not embargoed or otherwise have sanctions on them well this at least means that btc isnt a viable payment option
jailbreak,not_removed,more payment search filter option in cydia ftfy
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for the answer i have been away from the jailbreak scene for awhile now what was the reason it was removed and i dont mean specifically amazon payments i think that we just need alternatives as paypal doesnt work for everyone
jailbreak,not_removed,i really dont know ive just seen it in a lot of comments try to search p
jailbreak,not_removed,keep your jailbreak dont upgrade yet there are so many errors with the jb its not worth it wait a month or so until most of the problems get fixed and then jailbreak

jailbreak,not_removed,my is not laggy at all its jailbroken with one tweak activator for now im sticking with

jailbreak,not_removed,that happens sometimes try refreshing your sources list or respring your device
jailbreak,not_removed,you have to have itunes installed and open and make sure your device is recognized in itunes before you try impactor
jailbreak,not_removed,sync your phone in itunes the relaunch impactor
jailbreak,not_removed,like redownloading it from httpwwwcydiaimpactorcom ill try that
jailbreak,not_removed,it didnt work
jailbreak,not_removed,didnt someone say the work with ios and below
jailbreak,not_removed,hahahaha deep six them never heard someone say that before im going to start saying that
jailbreak,not_removed,wait shouldnt be too much longer in my opinion
jailbreak,not_removed,donate them lol
jailbreak,not_removed,wait for awhile they are just headsets after all
jailbreak,not_removed,i have them running on ios jb just connect them like regular bt
jailbreak,not_removed,they work below but the open and pair thing doesnt you have to pair with bluetooth in settings

jailbreak,not_removed,try flipcontrolcenter for your control center it adds some toggles
jailbreak,not_removed,whatever you do stay away from appsync for now itll fuck up a until its updated and try anchor to replace gridlock
jailbreak,not_removed,thanks for anchor waiting for the update
jailbreak,not_removed,maybe try installing apple file conduit and checking to make sure iexplorer has an emulate jailed option i know that ifunbox has that option
jailbreak,not_removed,hmm ifunbox crashes whenever i try running it so idk what to do theres no emulate jailbreak option on iexplorer either
jailbreak,not_removed,i wonder what happens if you install deb file through ifile
jailbreak,not_removed,i would like an answer for this too
jailbreak,not_removed,this is because bytafont tweak mode was crashing optitheme coolstar idk if you can around it but this is why it removes it
jailbreak,not_removed,you can if you download the latest deb unpack it and change the debiancontrol file to remove the conflict i wouldnt recommend it as bytafont has stolen code from anemone as well as the conflict mentioned above
jailbreak,not_removed,its a pain in the ass to use anemone for fonts
jailbreak,not_removed,doesnt work already tried
jailbreak,not_removed,change the debiancontrol file to remove the conflict enjoy the crashes from buggy bytafont tweak mode this is why it was marked as a conflict
jailbreak,not_removed,i know why im just providing a solution for anyone desperate enough to do it and deal with said crashes p i myself moved to anemone as soon as i heard about bytafont stealing your code on a side note do you remember me at all
jailbreak,not_removed,could you please remove the conflict they said they have fixed the bug with daemons i really dont like when someone else tell me what to install or not thats actually the reason why im jailbreaking my device
jailbreak,not_removed,seriously can you remove the conflict or allow us to downgrade this is really annoying i dont want to use anemone for fonts because i dont like the limited settings for it id prefer using bytafont tweak mode
jailbreak,not_removed,try changing jailbreak methods this worked for me if you did the jailbreak with the english method using cydia impactor then use the old chinese method and this will bring cydia back hope it helps
jailbreak,not_removed,dont give out your appleid or credit card number to random apps
jailbreak,not_removed,im wondering if this would work on an iphone which i doubt i think this is only for bit
jailbreak,not_removed,sounds like you got scammedanytime something asks for a creditdebit card you should know its a scam
jailbreak,not_removed,not sure about this but this particular program is interesting i did manage to go from to on a and what is cool is that there is a check box that says save user data or something like that and what i ended up with is with everything still intact just as if i would have done an ota update edit also it doesnt show that it can flash lower for all devices just a few
jailbreak,not_removed,agreed wonder if it does work on iphone or se cause i have an iphone se on and its slow asf would love to downgrade
jailbreak,not_removed,its actually not a scam at all in fact it uses the credit card or gift card thats already on your apple id same as ifunbox the software itself doesnt ask you for that at all what ever balance you have in your apple account is whats shown in this app sorry i should have made that clear
jailbreak,not_removed,its not possible to flash to an ipsw that is no longer being signed as for keeping your data when downgrading from a beta this can be done with itunes for freeno need to pay any money for this
jailbreak,not_removed,oh okay thats for clearing that up
jailbreak,not_removed,ios isnt making your se slow youve created an issue with all your jailbreak freedom
jailbreak,not_removed,whys it need an apple id
jailbreak,not_removed,didnt pay anything for it but correct me if im wrong but isnt the only way to go down from a beta on itunes is to do a restore with the ipsw not sure about restoring a backup from a beta once you go back but i have seen that itunes doesnt like to let a restore from a higher go to a lower and i understand that you cant flash to a version that isnt signed im just saying that this program says that it can havent actually tried it nor do i have the devices that it claims to be able to do this on so no way to actually test
jailbreak,not_removed,just like ifunbox if your going to install ipa or ios apps in simple terms ifunbox and require an apple id so that you arent pirating the ios apps its very common know a days with application managers for ios devices to have such a thing if yet provides ios app syncing due to apple and developers getting a lot of income damage and i dont blame them some devs rely solely on their ios app being paid for income if every software allowed you to install pirated apps no devs would get the money they deserve for their hard work
jailbreak,not_removed,just download the ipsw you want to downgrade to as long as it is still being signed hold shift and click update in itunes select the ipsw and update to the older software
jailbreak,not_removed,lol tdil had an iphone since the first one came out and never knew that only thought the hold shift was for restore thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,install mobile terminal and type uicache without quotes then hit enter wait a few seconds and check if it shows up on your springboard
jailbreak,not_removed,afaik its happening cause of appsync for some reason it breaks the uicache
jailbreak,not_removed,this guy thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,i see thanks for clarifying i got it working after someone told me to use the mobileterminal command
jailbreak,not_removed,no problem 👍
jailbreak,not_removed,make sure you see your device inside the cydia impactor window if you dont it means impactor isnt seeing your device could be a bad cable
jailbreak,not_removed,connect iphone to computer copy the file onto cydia impactor itll automatically pick the settings
jailbreak,not_removed,ill try another cable thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,agreed and also make sure you select your device from the drop down menu
jailbreak,not_removed,thats what ive been trying to do but it still says it requires an android device
jailbreak,not_removed,did you drag the right file into cydia impactor
jailbreak,not_removed,the nwa one right
jailbreak,not_removed,yes
jailbreak,not_removed,disable ui for your current theme in anemone
jailbreak,not_removed,okay cool will try that thanks
jailbreak,not_removed,thank you that worked
jailbreak,not_removed,ty going to remove it right now and see how it affect my battery
jailbreak,not_removed,yes i noticed this too uninstalled more battery life
jailbreak,not_removed,never wouldve thought it could drain my battery doesnt seem like it would require a lot
jailbreak,not_removed,how does it drain youre battery
jailbreak,not_removed,does anyone else experience more juice
jailbreak,not_removed,hi guys i dont seefeel any ill effects i have to give a shout out to carlos the dev of tweak for compiling a deb file for me with updated tweak that has a different fade timing original mine the guy even said you owe me nothing your words that you like it are enough i got something for free in this world yayyyyyy thanks again carlos gluck everyone sonny b
jailbreak,not_removed,tyty i have evanesco and was wondering why my battery dies so fast
jailbreak,not_removed,any changes
jailbreak,not_removed,any changes
jailbreak,not_removed,i only uninstalled it for a day so my result may not be accurate but honestly i dont feel the difference maybe i should wait and see i have like tweaks installed include themes i dont really see a huge changes before jailbreak and after it holds for about a day no matter how i use it so i dont really care about this but i uninstalled evanesco anyway since it doesnt have any real function
jailbreak,not_removed,no changes for me actually
jailbreak,not_removed,come back when you have access to a computer cant really do much without one
jailbreak,not_removed,are you trying to rejailbreak via the pp app but failing
jailbreak,not_removed,you need a computer to delete the polus data from dynamiclibrariesdo this whenever you have access to a computer install ifunbox on the computer reboot your phone so you dont have it jailbroken run the pp app as soon as it resprings hold the volume up button until you feel a vibration plugin you iphone on your computer and you should see it on your ifunbox app even if it it stucked on the bootlogo go to librarymobilesubstratedynamiclibraries and delete the polus plist and dylib the iphone now will continue to boot jailbroken
jailbreak,not_removed,not true i managed to get out of two boot loops yesterday without a computer but still computer will be helpful
jailbreak,not_removed,yes ive tried just about every trick there is even reinstalling the app
jailbreak,not_removed,dude im just going on what you said but i cant rejb youre gonna need a computer to do that
jailbreak,not_removed,i was having the same issue before i managed to get it working by killing all background apps then open the pp app and tap on the circle and wait like seconds and then lock your screen i did that a couple of times and then luckily one of them worked and showed the notification on my lock screen otherwise it would just reboot

jailbreak,not_removed,yeah these are local ads which promote apps so in the terms if you have mhb then you get ads if you dont have mhb then you get normal ads hopefully a tweak comes out that will block those as well if thats possible
