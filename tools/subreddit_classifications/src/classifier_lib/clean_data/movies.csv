movies,removed,turkey are evil
movies,removed,some time ago yify torrent but nw it probably stands for youtube
movies,removed,some journalist or documentary maker with courage really needs to do a documentary on how far the jews in hollywood had gone to quash mel gibsons passion of the christ the timeline of events have been documented in bits and pieces but to summarize mel could not even get a measly million in financing for the movie so he funded it himself mel had directed braveheart years earlier so its not like he was a josh trank or any number of newbies actors were warned that they would be blacklisted if they participated in the project respected actor henry caveziel confirmed that acting roles dried up after he made potc gibson persisted and made the movie anyway but hollywood studios would not help him distribute the movie theaters were warned not to show the movie or else christian groups heard about mels movie and started a grassroots movement to get the movie in theaters it had a limited showing but the theaters were packed because of efforts by churches to bus people to the theaters so a movie with practically no budget no distribution network and no advertising only negative press about it being an antisemitic film went on to make million the highestgrossing rrated movie until deadpool knocked it off this year mel got a lot of that million for producing it and hollywood couldnt stand it so they had to go after mel and discredit him as an antisemite but they sneakily went after his dad in a series of media articles that claimed mels father was a nazi sympathizer then mel was caught leaving a bar drunk by a jewish cop in la who probably staked him out and the cop said he made antisemitic remarks honestly what are the odds of a jewish cop in la then you had recorded tapes of gibson ranting about jews like who hasnt honestly made by his jewish golddigging estranged wife mission accomplished jews wrecked mels reputation and discredited the potc movie by a supposed antisemite that was a warning to others who might dare to go against jews in hollywood or elsewhere its really a fascinating story and i really hope someone with balls in journalism would do a report on it hopefully a jewish journalist because whoever takes on this job will be labelled an antisemite with every jew who didnt die in the holocaust after him or her
movies,removed,youre free to torrent all of those
movies,removed,until they remove geographic restrictions on movies i think ill continue to torrent them
movies,removed,its rfullmoviesonyoutubr
movies,removed,i had a problem with pia randomly turning off mid torrent
movies,removed,no i dont care about a good rendition of the character all i care about is if the character was good some people might hate the character arc for valid reasons but a lot of people hate it because it is not accurate to the comic books again this batman is temporary and makes him a pretty hopeful character tell me what in particular you want me to break down for you and ill break it down for you just tell me why the character arc sucks i cant get more specific than that you see it right you see how you fucked up here right i see it because i know how retards like you would use the word sensationalist is not what you use to describe a film about fictional people people dont even use that for biographical film this is not journalism we are talking about inaccurate would be a better word
movies,removed,check out rfreemoviesonyoutube
movies,removed,from the article larson is a bit of a superhero in person talking about her profession for example as being an act of service give me a break some twat getting paid an exorbitant amount of money to play comic book makebelieve in front of a camera is an act of service does anyone even believe that

movies,removed,apocalypto is racist procolonialist propaganda it really isnt that well made but it has convinced people that gibson has some sort of redeeming qualities i dont understand why people like it
movies,removed,except that it doesnt matter nowadays the only kind of girl guys want are asian whore types all whiteys crave asian whores and its only for sex they do not care about land before time or real feelings just sex sex sex all the time this is why our family has banned asians from all our business dealings chinese especially whores all of them

movies,removed,httptribtribalgodcom
movies,removed,you didnt end up with me you ended up with you
movies,removed,did i say that no i am responding to the simplistic and often inaccurate claim the availability has nothing to do with piracy i know the only reason i ever joined a torrent tracker was to get movies i couldnt buy even via special order from abroad
movies,removed,again i never said any such thing i said why i pirate which is because my tastes run in the obscure and a very large majority of what i want isnt commercially available meanwhile i pay for hulu netflix amazon prime and cable and have a massive dvd and cd collection so i have no problem paying for what i want if it actually exists as commercially available media but i make no claim that im representative of the average torrent user
movies,removed,fag

movies,removed,hey can u buy me bat man on ds
movies,removed,hey can u buy me bat man on ds
movies,removed,hey can u buy me bat man on ds
movies,removed,the fact that this movie didnt give me enough character development to care and then killed every one made this movie unbearable for me war what is it good for absolutely nothing unless your plan is to steal the plans for the death start then it is worth making a movie that spends more time on finding new ways to destroy space ships instead of developing a watchable script this movie suffers from michael bay syndrome seemed noncanonical imo
movies,removed,dick and dyke there something for everyone here
movies,removed,the story and characters sucked neckbeard
movies,removed,i really enjoyed the big awesome battle that made up the last act well worth the ticket price but if the first half had been as good as the second we could have had one of best star wars movies period unfortunately the movie begins with a prologue and then a lot of jumping around from location to location with rather quick and sparse character introductions so overall this is a fun if flawed addition to the star wars saga
movies,removed,without all of them dying it becomes a serious plot hole in episode four why would these characters probably more important too the rebellion than anyone just not appear if they were alive they had a choice of killing them or writing a shitty riding off into the sunset scene that would make no god damned sense they made the right and in my opinion obvious decision to kill everyone
movies,removed,youre a fucking retard
movies,removed,
movies,removed,just an fyi for the future theres a bunch of loser feminists from rmoviescirclejerk who constantly scour this sub and downvote and harass anyone who doesnt worship shitty films with vag havers as main characters

movies,removed,you have no idea what you are talking about those people are less conservative than you think and their political causes have a lot more to do with corporate interests than the typical left right spectrum they also do not have very firm control over the media i am a centerist and thing the republicans are coo coo for coa coa puffs but the idea that the media other than the rights various bastions isnt staff by a bunch of people who are mostly coastal elites from the far left of the spectrum is just silly nearly all of them come from the same viewpoint and a surprising number of them even come from the same bostonbrooklynivy leaguejewish viewpoint

movies,removed,really thats what made the movie more awesome for me granted i was raised on western and mountain man lore i couldnt bring myself to see the revenant because i grew up on the stories and saw the robert redford movie on him i just thought only taking ten nazi scalps was too few but then men in my family hunted tortured and euthanized nazis post wwii its not like they were human or anything my biggest complaint with inglourious basterds was that there was far too few nazi killings and what little there was was all tame and sweet like two virgin gay boys lovingly getting it on for the first time when that shit needed to be straight prison rape riot savage you know when thirty plus inmates come in and straight gang rape the new lily white boy for eighteen hours straight while a prison riot goes on and the bitch boy loses his shit so bad he escapes and then brutally murders a mother and two daughters in a completely sick and fucked up rape and murder way while the fatherhusband watches on in vain thats how fucking murdery inglourious basterds should have gotten

movies,removed,there are things to be enjoyed about the film in general it is fun to watch after all but the only things that truly stood out were toby kebbell with his motion capture and the action scenes the humans felt completely weak performance and character wise regardless its still something that i could say was a fun time full review

movies,removed,i find women love to kiss their own asses claim virtues and skills and intelligence they absolutely do not possess cannot gracefully handle criticism and are constantly whining about doing what the men are doing instead of just going their own way and being women in separate areas their own sports their own inventions very scarce etc

movies,removed,well shes asian i doubt it came naturally
movies,removed,sounds pretty gay
movies,removed,
movies,removed,it definitely sounds like way too much i dont know if they meant this to be just for movie piracy or combined with music and tv but it still sounds like a preposterously high number but even if it were accurate its not like the industry is missing that money its not like studious are going bankrupt and actors are losing jobs because of torrents people who will watch shitty cam versions or lower quality screeners are people who were not planning on paying for your movie even if it didnt show up on pirate bay either because they cant afford it or the movie isnt available in their country or they dont care about the movie enough to go to the cinema or just on some dumb antiestablishment principle whichever is the case you could say the studio isnt really losing money because they werent going to earn it in the first place if all pirating stopped billion would not suddenly pour into the market
movies,removed,the day of september i was home alone watching shrek i heard a ring at the doorbell and walked over looking out the door i saw a car driving away and a small package sitting on the doorstep curious i brought it inside and unwrapped it it was a case with jacob slendtorius written on it in comic sans confused i scratched my head and pulled out the case i opened it up and inside was a cd i placed the cd in my cd player and white noise played i heard scratching at my window and as i approached the noise on the cd got louder and so did the scratching my heart was racing faint noises of breath hitting a microphone sounded from the cd i listened closer it was jacob sartoriuss distorted mixtape the sound of autotune echoed in the background suddenly from my window i saw a beanied gnomelike figure the stench of popcorn singeing my nose behind him was a tall dark figure wearing a sweatshirt and bearing the most hideous of braces the mixtape the gnome figure the scratching i knew it could be only one thing it was jacob slendtorius i thought he was just an urban legend but the hideous beast was standing mere meters away from me what is up dramalertnation lets get roiiiight into the news the gnome whispered i screamed and my ears began to bleed the taller figure the one i had now recognized to be jacob slendtorius slowly walked forward frantically i pulled up the youtube app on my phone and disliked all of his videos and unsubscribed the slendtorius approached me slowly and awkwardly now only feet away in a raspy prepubescent autotuned voice with a menacing chuckle and intrusive grin he told me that i could wear his sweatshirt i dont want to please leave me alone i replied his grin dropped and his face went blank he came closer making me increasingly uncomfortable he warned me that if i do not post this on reddit i will be forced to listen to his mixtape for the rest of my life and he will make me wear his sweatshirt the slendtorius left seven lyric pages and selfadvertisements and promotions on the ground and forced me to hide them in the forest he vanished into the night along with his smaller gnome figure i took the godforsaken cd and attempted to break it but it wouldnt crack hammered it scratched it threw it sat on it digested it but it wouldnt break i put it in the cd player once more and it was a message from the slendtorius you must share this cd give it to an unsuspecting person and do not mention me you will otherwise be forever cursed just like this cd i put it in the mail to a random address and my life has been normal ever since i had my phone on me at the time and was able to take a few pictures for proof i took pictures of the cd case the silhouette of the slendtorius at my window and a few other pictures that ended up being corrupted these are those images

movies,removed,metaflix
movies,removed,kind of like youtube deleting videos or hollywood studios not showing preview shows before the premier i would imagine the best thing they can do is to flood the black market dvd or torrents with poor copies of the movies with missing scenes unfocused pictures inaudible sound etc or learn from the us where we make mostly star wars or avenger films that is pointless to watch without a theater size screen
movies,removed,sure its the best kind if you then want to go see it but from what i saw i want to take a dump on it
movies,removed,removed for being plagarized article

movies,removed,wrong you stupid cunt
movies,removed,star the laste jedi wars
movies,removed,yeah but i think the point is that luke dies so either rey is the last jedi or she starts a new order of force users making luke the real last one
movies,removed,is the last jedi snoke
movies,removed,could mean anything could mean that luke says i am the last jedi he renounces the jedi ways and he starts a new force religion with different better values
movies,removed,i love the fact that the last jedi kinda refers to luke skywalker
movies,removed,star the last jedi wars
movies,removed,i wonder who the last jedi could be
movies,removed,yep the last jedi to have a beard twist theyll all be women from now on
movies,removed,the force awakens the last jedi the last jedi rises
movies,removed,i bet luke will be the last jedi throughout the film while training rey then at the end like dies and his final words are something like rey youre the last jedi now carry on the tradition blehghgg
movies,removed,this is why i must become star wars ix the last jedi returns the quest for peace volume
movies,removed,so thats is huh we some kinda the last jedi
movies,removed,should also note that the last jedi doesnt necessary mean the last jedi for all of time nor necessarily mean the only jedi remaining it could be like my exgirlfriend or as i refer to her as the last girlfriend whenever speaking of her
movies,removed,the last jedi more like the next jedi
movies,removed,while that is true the last jedi was a line in the force awakens spoken by snoke and in that context it was singular and referring to luke skywalker
movies,removed,you can call it the first jedi and this one the last jedi
movies,removed,my reaction when i read a comment saying shamalamadimdgong is as visceral as reading nigger in reference to denzel washington or a black actor not sure why this subreddit allows and upvotes racism in this case its not funny it isnt clever
movies,removed,just rewatched this last night after reading a split spoiler great movie bruce willis in his prime
movies,removed,watch online movies tv shows free httpswwwyugamingnetmovies
movies,removed,yes thats a great point i remember reading something along the lines of the imbalance in the force is that there are pure light side and pure dark side users each side bastardizing the force a balanced force user doesnt cast aside any part of the force
movies,removed,let me guess this moviefemale lead political correctness all over throw in a few gays too while were at it re use a plot from an old episode try to bring nostalgia leave at a cliff hanger and release another recycled episode next year for a money grab cod of movies yay
movies,removed,they nominated it in an effort to discredit it hillary is a terrible person
movies,removed,oh shit lukes a goner now too
movies,removed,here you go
movies,removed,just when i thought my opinion of the eu and the disney sw could get any lower the last jedi that is so lowest common denominator the least amount of creative input one could imagine its just ughh
movies,removed,my personal theory is that this is last in the sense of most recent like you should see what the last jedi to come in here did
movies,removed,welp based on this exchange im gonna assume theres some spoileriffic unbreakable reference in split thanks for your clever shhhhh
movies,removed,it could just be the previous jedi luke who was the last jedi to exist even luke i dont know
movies,removed,official merchandise aint canon though i mean luke is most likely the last jedi but theres a ton of stuff that could imply maybe there are more but their training isnt complete maybe they are all wiped out maybe luke will die and rey becomes the last jedi disney is doing this because it wants speculations it wants discussion while i hope i am wrong here the new trilogy points towards mimicking the original saga just as the prequels do they will most likely have redemption stories kill a big character make a huge revelation etc
movies,removed,star the last jedi wars
movies,removed,yeah thats what happened there is only ever siths to bring balance to the force there has to be only two jedi or a group of force weidling wizards who are neither emo fags or white night sjwsbut isntead balanced individuals
movies,removed,in brazil portuguese like many languages have male and female words the last jedi in portuguese refers to a singular male luke instead of plural jedi or gender neutral
movies,removed,spoiler alert its probably not the last jedi
movies,removed,i always thought that return of the jedi should be named the last jedi i probably called it that in my head a couple times it just made sense he was the last jedi
movies,removed,professor xxx the last jedi
movies,removed,star wars is for fat nerds and little kids
movies,removed,he probably voted for trump
movies,removed,this movie was so antipatriotic im surprised the sjws werent crawling out of their fatpods to defend it
movies,removed,my guess is that luke is the last jedi because in this movie we will see the start of something new a new order but not a new jedi order luke will be the last jedi and either rey or a redeemed kylo ren will be the first of whatever comes next
movies,removed,i love this actor
movies,removed,oh shit i think i know who the last jedi is
movies,removed,who said luke is truly a jedi if he has rejected the jedi way of life reject emotion and love etc etc etc is he really a jedi food for thought perhaps snoke believes luke is the last jedi when in actuality it may have been obiwan kenobi and yoda who were the last jedi
movies,removed,now youre interpreting the title as the last jedi who dies and they go extinct personally i see it as they found luke the last jedi alive at the time of discovery and he will most likely train a new one
movies,removed,id just go with the equivalent of the last jedis
movies,removed,speculation time ahoy luke may have become a jedi at the end of rotj but he embraced the dark side in order to do it by defeating vader he became a jedi but by refusing to strike down the emperor he realized he made a big mistake between luke attempts to restart the jedi training only to find the dark side easily seduces some and he loses all of his students maybe now luke realizes that the jedi dealing with absolutes are whats caused them to die off and the only way to attain a higher level of understanding is to become one with the force embracing and using both sides of it by saying the last jedi it implies that the jedi wayorder of thinkingtreating situations is now gone because it only implies one way to do things
movies,removed,no one cares geek
movies,removed,also snoke said leading them to the last jedi if skywalker returns the new jedi will rise

movies,removed,okay im calling it now the film will start with a rocky style montage of luke training ray with music then luke will get killed and ray will be the last jedi
movies,removed,i like the name but im kind of disappointed that its got the same lazy logo design as the force awakens the original trilogy had logos for each film even the had good logos although they were derivative of return of the jedi and emphasized the episode number way too much and even stuff httpscreenrantcomwpcontentuploadsrogueoneastarwarsstorylogojpg of the main saga has kept the star wars and by comparison the logos for the force awakens and the last jedi look like someone whipped them up in indesign in five minutes with no real planning
movies,removed,well you see the guy suggested that the last jedi would be the title of the next star wars film i inferred that he also voted for trump who happened to win citing my edit to my parent comment trump was interchangeable with anything that won amongst other candidates options such as boaty mcboatface or i could have said he must have liked spotlight academy award winner for best picture
movies,removed,episode ix return of the last jedi
movies,removed,you must have used your jedi skills to guess the title so well you are the last jedi huh 🤔
movies,removed,i had a conversation with my dad also an avid star wars fan about this and his initial reaction was negative the last jedi if they kill off the jedi what will the next movie be episode ix oops we forgot about this other jedi

movies,removed,heres an interesting thing about me rather than enjoying reboots sequels and remakes instead i take an opposite position i am actually against sequels remakes and reboots despite their immense popularity which does not matter to me as i am unconcerned with following social norms others have called me a rebel for this reason an assessment with which i concur when hollywood rolls out the trailer for their latest sequel reboot or remake i roll my eyes and register my disgust before anyone else i am also against the use of cgi in movies another interesting opinion that i have which i am more than happy to discuss if you are curious how movies could possibly be made with less or even very little cgi merely ask me and i will be happy to educate you
movies,removed,i guess youre not allowed to criticize sequels or cgi use on this subreddit if you love cgi sequels so much maybe you should marry one

movies,removed,well this whole movie was retarded the writing team should be shot just on the principle that period that stupid shouldnt be allowed to breed every single thing about this movie was moronic the entire plot was driven by supposedly smart people making the stupidest fucking choices every chance they got people just doing dumb shit that they would never do in real life especially because they were experts in their subject absolutely nothing in this movie wasnt fucking retarded literally everything was the dumbest shit youve ever seen except for the visuals the graphics team was on point it was a beautiful movie but that doesnt change the fact that the movie was unbelievably stupid
movies,removed,just sayin if a year old or we ran at me id just punt that little faggot and itd be game over

movies,removed,the push for in movies especially those where it adds nothing to the experience was a bad one but the technology is going to pay off long term why do i say that vr vr is going to be the next movie theater experience i dont know how yet but i do think in years well be going to some kind of establishment for a fully immersive vr experience similar to an arcade for noninteractive vr i think well still go to something like theaters though maybe a theater with swivel chairs

movies,removed,i think really my problem with it was that the story just wasnt the kind of story i like in general i really dont like romantic dramas or romantic comedies if the focus of the movie is on someones love story i probably wont like it usually the exception for me is musicals but the whole not a standard musicalyou could forget youre watching a musical thing that made non musical lovers like the movie did nothing for me also i found ryan goslings character totally insufferable i think i would absolutely hate him in real life and one of the only scenes i liked was the scene where he sells out with john legend so in the end when they werent together my reaction was just kind of like good hes the worst
movies,removed,there seems to be a huge persecution complex among white american males speaking as a white american male in recent years is it not obvious any time white males as a group are brought up in the media recently its disproportionately negative when they say something about it white males ridiculed for being fragile white males have helped create the most equal prosperous stable and progressive societies in the world but going by how theyve been portrayed in the past years one would assume that theyre the most problematic group
movies,removed,drowning in pussy umm yes absolutely the foot tall guy with his own kingdom and the strength of a bear would be world fucking famous he would likely be a keystone to a sex tourism trade

movies,removed,yeah so sick of these disgusting faggots
movies,removed,so i should torrent it or do you want me to pay my hard earned money on something that looks terrible in the previews its not my fault the studio did a shit job of promoting it why should they be rewarded for that

movies,removed,sjwcuck lies the movie is a disgrace to to western civilization
movies,removed,tldr all positive reviews are sjw feminist shills looks like it yeah do you really think the same people who wrote articles beforehand defending the movie from misogynist haters or otherwise turning it into a political issue were going to review it negatively for example looking at positive reviews and the other activity from the authors httpsarchiveisugexd the same author wrote this a month ago the misogynist outrage over the ghostbusters remake has made it essential viewing how likely was someone who wrote that to give the movie a negative review httpsarchiveisrqgzr this reboot is a revelation – and it aint afraid of no misogynists well maybe not so much a mystery as just a dispiriting reminder that misogyny is alive and well on the internet where it can metastasize to gross extremes with zero justification and for anyone eager to stand atop a pedestal to righteously proclaim that objections to a new ghostbusters simply stem from a frustration with hollywood exploiting adolescent nostalgia well where are all the virulent internet campaigns against say the new ninja turtles series no it is easy to see what the ghostbusters furor is really about angry bored womenhating men expending otherwise untapped energy mining their own feelings of social inadequacy in a toxic bid for attention httpsarchiveisfnimi ghostbusters review call off the trolls – paul feigs female reboot is a blast shockingly the guy thats been complaining about haters for months before seeing the movie thinks the haters were wrong cant wait and screw the haters new ghostbusters trailer nods to controversy over race and gender fck the haters this new ghostbusters trailer has me psyched it doesnt need to women gays will make it a hit ghostbusters targets male viewers w new nba ads httpsarchiveishxvdi girls rule women are funny get over it i actually think the ghostbusters concept works better as nerd girls vs mansplainers instead of bluecollar schlubs vs the epa remaking this beloved film with women as leads is an act revolutionary enough to attract the ire of legions of ghostbros insisting that the very concept will warp time and space to retroactively ruin their childhoods httpsarchiveissnrrp forget the sexist naysayers says robbie collin if the first trailer is anything to go by this allfemale reboot will be every bit as fun as the original yes yes but when is it male ghostbusters day httpsarchiveisyxzah one of his previous articles on it httpsarchiveisnhcgq on twitter httparchiveisyzykr devincf if its good thats awesome but this opinion that if anyone says the movie looks bad they are automatically sexist is crazy boustanua its not crazy its true devincf why boustanua i dont know why youre sexist probably because girls dont like you

movies,removed,love transcends dimensions ah yes the misunderstood message of the film if you actually watched the fucking film and not jack off to shitty circlejerk comments repeating the same thing over and over again youll see she meant that human affection towards others is the only thing that can make a logical man make illogical choices which is what cooper does at the end sure the dialogue is a bit cheesy in that scene but the movie is garbage because of three words ahahaha holy fuck bro can you enjoy anything
movies,removed,no one gives a shit about your podcast
movies,removed,how about a tv series i was kind of disapointed that walter white it woiuld have been interesting for him to loose everyone close to him and beat the cancer at point both walter jr and jessee were going to be killed off early in the series run it would have been a painful poetic justice for walt who started down this dark road to provide money for his family after his death to end up with all the money good health but no family

movies,removed,i do think movies with a massive twist ending are practically remakeproof movies like fight club sixth sense and the usual suspects all have their fame based on one very key plot point being secret until near or at the very end brad pitt being imaginary bruce willis being dead and kevin spacey being keyser soze are among the biggest plot twists in cinematic history how can you do a reboot to any of those movies without those twists and how can you give a fresh take on the material with of the audience will know the twist going in
movies,removed,free watch or download hd movies
movies,removed,jew
movies,removed,i really hated eye in the sky the acting was fine the plot seemed okay but the subject matter was some liberal bullshit that some fucking jew who loves killing arabs anyway thought up in hollywood was it even remotely realistic that the soldier commanding the drone hesitated much less disobeyed the order from cmdr helen mirran yeah im sure most family men in the military would have strong feelings about taking about a target with collateral damage but one fucking girl you risk the lives of your fellow agents on the ground as well as civilians if that suicide bomber breaks containmentfor one girl the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one the message i took from the movie was that soldiers in the military are fucking pussies who will jeopardize their fellow soldiers because of their emotions
movies,removed,i feel that all people should kill themselves rsanctionedsuicide there is no purpose to live everyone you know will die and no one will remember you in years theres no god and the earth will die when the sun expands everything will end with the universe heat death

movies,removed,i just watched the whole show holy shit i am so sad the shining is my alltime favorite film and she was phenomenal in it she is one of the irreplaceable elements in that film that makes it work she has incredible talent and wide berth of things she can give to not only the arts but whatever it is she wants to give to anything when i watched this its clear to me that shes still functioning but her perception of reality is way off she was all over the place her brain is working and shes still incredibly intelligent she just cant filter things properly i dont know what the hell happened and im sad to say i have no idea if it can be treated i hope for her sake it can and if it can that shell let them treat her i hope very hard for her to having a better quality of living and that she can regain some sense of sanity
movies,removed,its like they want us to torrent
movies,removed,all i know is im not seeing one particular movie rogue one a star wars story the title is so fucking cringe worthy it sounds like a feminist empowerment fan fiction and that gay ass first trailer didnt didnt do one damn thing to dispel that myth heres a breakdown the chick looks like a emo fag to start with like she may as well be a more annoying version of juno then youre graced with this bit of dialog random female commander who might be fine if she didnt sound like she had a stick shoved up her ass on youre own since the age of reckless aggressive and undisciplined stupid fucking main character trying to make those traits sound like theyre even remotely desirable for basically a military operation this is a rebellion isnt it i rebel whatis this star wars for faggots i wanted a movie at leastthree times this good ♪♫♪♫♪ im a giiiiiiiirl and im on a space missionnnnnn and im gonna blow things up cuz im a girllllll the whole universe can kiss my asssssss and they cant really do anything about it cuz im a girlllll i win cuz im a girl woooo star wars ♪♫♪♫♪ even the special effects cant make me interested in this movie look at the giant difference between the first and third trailer she went from being in almost every scene to being in almost none hell i could barely tell she was the main character anymore if it werent for the shit title a star wars storywat why the fuck not just star wars rogue one and knowing she is the main character i might be interested but theres no fucking way even with the donnie yen bait because they knew it would take an asian martial artist doing actual martial arts in a star wars movie to get people to go see this garbage that im gonna go pay to watch almost juno run around in space with a laser for hours you notice they had the cast the raid in the legit star wars which is pretty much the best martial arts movie ever made and they did not have them do one lick of martial arts or give them any type of light saber that was annoying but the movie stood on its own anyway this one you damn well know the asians are going to be doing some martial arts because they made sure to put it in the trailer and its donnie fucking yen as a final tidbit even with the third trailer being better heres a line for you halfrobot black guy whose other movies ill probably never respect again if i were to see this movie save the rebellion save the dream
movies,removed,you see thats where youre wrong i dont hate women i hate certain kinds of people people who generalize specific information and apply it to everyone for example those kinds of people are about the most fucking stupid trashy people in existence like youll say exactly what annoys you it wont apply to most people at all and then theyre like so basically youre hitler take for example this one piece of shit i ran into recently i was talking about the new a star wars story because apparently its not a fucking star wars movie and i mentioned how annoying it was i also talked about specific character traits i didnt like because they are completely fucking stupid especially the its awesome not because its awesome but because there is a chick in it that doesnt apply to all women not even close for example i loved star wars the force unleashed oh shit look a real fucking title i also really liked the female lead in that movie because it wasnt retarded like rogue one a star wars story gag but this stupid faggot generalizing piece of shit like i have no idea how someone can be this fucking stupid instead of using their brain one fucking bit this stupid fag is like oh hey he doesnt like stupid annoying shit he must hate all women i know ill let him know that because obviously thats a great idea yeah those people are absolute fucking morons you know we should stop even talking to them right now since all they do is talk at themselves anyway have a great day person hope you dont run into any of those faggots amirite fuck you and gday

movies,removed,so is he officially the first celebrity to utter the words raped by a pack of niggers and somehow still have a career
movies,removed,but they dont get their money they dont release there leading to torrents which leads to a non profit zone
movies,removed,maybe maybe nigger was a fluke but chink is extremely telling that word is not some random soft epithet its a direct racist one and would carry just as much weight in australia if not more so given their proximity to asia
movies,removed,so vigilantism is fascism and slippery slope counts as an argument youre a retard got it btw i was referring to government action rather than vigilantes that ones on me for not specifying but maybe take the law book out of your ass and actually think for yourself a world where people actually faced issues would be a better world
movies,removed,its also intended for people to read about the movie and get an idea if its worth taking a trip to the theater or not its not an exclusive club for movie nerds such as yourself thats why things like imdb exist people dont want to go into a movie not knowing what theyre paying for so fuck off you elitist cunt
movies,removed,id be willing to have a conversation sure but as soon as you throw out chink and nigger back to back youre getting the fuck out of my car period theres absolutely no excuse for that and i dont care where youre from
movies,removed,i still have that problem its pretty annoying workaround is adding the cc subtitles on those scenes they contain translations but i dont want to have subtitles on the whole time so it gets annoying if it changes a lot usually if that happens i stop watching torrent the movie and watch the torrent which contains proper subtitles
movies,removed,the world doesnt need you

movies,removed,ok im going to lay it out the way it really is chinese people dont give a shit about any of this because they live in china with billion other chinese and they dont have to face racism from anyone they also dont give a shit that whites in the west white wash everything because again they dont have to face it its asian americans who care asian americans are fucking sick of the white savior bullshit that white people love to circlejerk to why is wanda group making this movie they are diversifying their assets into entertainment and american entertainment is the most profitable in the world they started out as a real estate company they want a white guy to star in their chinese movie so white people will watch it then maybe one day white people will be used to watching chinese movies thats what they are hoping for what they dont know is whites are racist as fucking shit towards asian males and think of asian females as nothing more than whores for white dick if only the asians in asia truly knew how asians are treated in the west they wouldnt like the west so much still asians in asia dont care about any of it because they live in their own country and dont have to face it every day even if they see some faggot ass asian guy in a white movie or asian girls who cant get white dick out of their mouths its just one thing for them they step outside and its all over if youre asian in america each time asians are depicted in that way it destroys your image bit by bit it brainwash you because thats all you see just like how commercials can make people want something if all the media combined portray a singular image for asians in america what do you think happens to asian americans its a serious issue but at the same time theres only about million asian americans so who cares right exactly thats why it keeps happening so yes this is fucking white washing because its injecting yet another white savior into an asian story still the chinese dont give a fuck about it it doesnt matter that this story is a fantasy or that it was a chinese companys idea or whatever bullshit technicality you can give it fact is its a white guy saving asians again also i have nothing against matt damon and none of this is his fault he was offered a movie for whatever money he took it hes not in the movie shitting on asians or any nasty shit its just a normal role to him

movies,removed,i think the main problem with death note is that you need strong english speaking actors to carry a movie like that but then when you get english speaking actors you get the whole debate of white people appropriating the japanese story i think its too early to make good anime movies theres no one that has perfected the formula for that yet tom cruise got closest with edge of tomorrow but he changed the entire story to do it

movies,removed,tucker and dale wasnt really horror cabin was okayish but it sort of became an action flick at the end most of those other ones were crap
movies,removed,i went to see captain america civil war a few weeks ago first time going to a theater to see a movie in about or years waiting for the start it was nonstop commercials coke pepsi cars furniture insurance etc it was like watching tv without a show i made a joke that i missed the good old days when it was basically a powerpoint of ads at least then we wouldnt have been stuck listening to bad voiceovers and crappy music for the privilege of paying for tickets then when it finally started a few minutes late we were treated to another to minutes of ads followed by minutes or so of trailers for movies i have no desire to see if anyone associated with the movie industry is reading this this is precisely why i torrent
movies,removed,i was more focused on half of her thong popping out of those sweet camo capris but yes those glasses scream its and i get to go to a sum and blink concert to drink wine coolers and smoke our one joint i stole from my big brother

movies,removed,doctor strange has been out for days in my country and i havent watch any movies for months so its easily the best ive watched this week im not really into comics but marvel studios still make this film enjoyable and understandable much like what i felt about their other titles cumberbatch is really good in his role as strange i must say

movies,removed,kind of waited a long time to make a big deal out of it didnt she
movies,removed,bull fucking shit im sure youd think that when you get an extra second to live in a car crash or a crumb of bread for dinner thats basically what people suggest when combating climate change its miniscule bullshit petty garbage that makes them feel like they make a difference and thats a downright wrong idea to give them they are doing fuck all and shouldnt be able to convince themselves they are helping because when they come down to making real proper change its oh that doesnt apply to me because ive been doing x for years already
movies,removed,you should kill yourself the world would be a much better place without you

movies,removed,nice one however i have a short funny movie tailer may be you like it
movies,removed,its unbelievable how nobody cares about the actual characters and are more loyal to actors and actresses thats why people have issues with these movies now they are trying to wipe out white people
movies,removed,so why are we downvoting people who like the movie
movies,removed,are they still a werewolf and a frog
movies,removed,i was expecting the worst but i was blown away at how amazing it was this is the godfather of comedies people will be studying the comedic genius of this movie in film schools i hope it doesnt get snubbed at the oscars but considering what happened last year with oscarssowhite i wouldnt be surprised sad but the movie was great
movies,removed,i dont want to waste my money on this movie i will admit that i have not seen itbut from the trailers i am not giving it a chance looks cheesy with bad humor and adds shame to the original im sure it will make money because alot of ghostbuster fans have waited for a movie to come out to pay tribute i am not investing my money on this fiasco
movies,removed,i agree just from seeing the trailers
movies,removed,you make me want to vomit
movies,removed,i couldnt even make it through the full trailer because the annoying girl from true grit grew up to look like a bad tranny
movies,removed,in my opinion the matrix was a success because of the way neo was portrayed even if will smith acted well i dont think he would of brought the right energy to the part seeing will smith as depressed is not as interesting as keanu reeves because keanu reeves is basically that autistic in real life
movies,removed,do people just get dumber when they get married and shit out offspring if this movie did not enrage you as a card carrying male member then if i were you id grab a magnifying glass and tweezers and see if you still have any balls left

movies,removed,is it possible for you to be a bigger yesman sheeple or would the universe explode from you going beyond full blown ignoramus
movies,removed,i love all the downvotes im getting for liking this film fuck you guys
movies,removed,show me a law that specifically says to arrest black people
movies,removed,you missed the point of my post racism is the belief one race is superior or inferior to another that definition is set you cant make up a new definition for that word your example involves systemic racism which has its own definition calling a person racist because he is part of a system that holds a racial bias is incorrect the employer in your example is not a racist he doesnt view any race as superior or inferior however he is also a victim of systemic racism since he subconsciously shows a bias
movies,removed,one of the writers from my site just finished a writeup on this movie anyone interested is welcome to read it and if you have any feedback ill happily relay it to the author httphypewriternetghostbustersandthetaskofareboot

movies,removed,yeah i mean it was a bigbudget summer movie which delivered exactly what i thought it would people act like the original films are some sort of masterpiece thats being destroyed most of the comments in this thread are pure cancer from neckbeards who decided they were going to hate it no matter what
movies,removed,but nowhere in the law does it state to arrest black people because theyre black just because blacks are unfairly represented in drug crimes it doesnt mean those laws are inherent to blacks white people are still subject to those laws just because they have the money to pay for tickets and lawyers it doesnt mean they are exempt from drug laws like i said there are no laws that specifically say to arrest black people drug use isnt inherent to black people
movies,removed,because they didnt want reddit to bitch how ghostbusters is all over again and that it probably cost trillion trillion to rebuilt and trillion lives
movies,removed,or take gender studies a fuck ton of that shit is coming from the other end of the horseshoe
movies,removed,torrent it and donate the money
movies,removed,can we all admit that the original ghostbusters was not that great
movies,removed,i see a lot of posts here made by people with unusual usernames claiming the film is good are they plants
movies,removed,based on all the reviews ive seen it can all be summed up as movie is shit but the actors are awesome take that gamergaters i dont seem to find a lot of reviews that actually genuinely love the movie itself instead of just the people acting in it and of course youll find few positive reviews from big outlets without them taking a shot at the manbabies who said the movie would be shit based on a trailer that made the movie look like it would be shit ill watch it eventually i guess and see for myself

movies,removed,youre profoundly stupid
movies,removed,whenever someone wants to retaliate against the atrocities committed by white people not sure if youre retarded or purposely being obtuse how are all white people to blame for the actions of a very tiny percentage of people not all of whom were white dont forget and that legal precedent was used to essentially institutionalize slavery and although most slavemasters were white youre talking about by all estimates less than of the population finally how many hundreds of thousands of whites died in a war whos primary goal was to free slaves and how many whites lead raids like john brown or otherwise worked tirelessly in the abolitionist movement so fuck off with your committed by white people bullshit grade narrative read a fucking book and expand your understanding of the era and the subject matter before you try and speak on it

movies,removed,i saw films this week citizen the drop demolition treasure planet my favorite one of them all was treasure planet for some reason i never got to see it as a kid but i can say that this film is fantastic and there should be a live action remake thatd be awesome
movies,removed,i didnt see many new movies ones i did see were very meh but i guess central intellegence at least kept me entertained

movies,removed,is he playing make believe with his free speech rights just wait until the left grabs the guns and then comes for the free speech or the left loses political power after they take the guns and the cuckersvative globalist religious right decides to censor free speech and art films by matt damon will be labeled as problematic and thrown onto the bonfire of censorship stupid fucking assclown doesnt get it he just never learned from history free speech and the right to express artistic freedom like matt exercises in his films can be taken away by a soldier simply following orders pointing a fucking rifle in his face rights are not gifts from government

movies,removed,this is how she looked after her stint in the israeli army do not be a revisionist it was a huge stretch for hollywood to go to israel to cast someone with a mumbling thick accent no athletic body and very little acting experience gadot is only a common name know because of the fame of bvs but they gave her a deal anyway so she could be the jewish wonder woman to kill nazis something that is only in a hollywood wet dream and its not only her ezra miller another jew was given the role of flash the justice league is called the jleague for short but it really means the jewish league
movies,removed,cool ill reserve judgement until i see it for myself it has been getting quite the acclaim recently enjoy being triggered
movies,removed,hollywood had a jewish lead picked long before any auditions you would have to be in complete denial or just extremely naive to think otherwise unfortunately whites get the blame for racism in hollywood when white gentiles are just as discriminated as blacks hispanics and asians

movies,removed,okay so what youre actually saying is that you dont like the comic book character amanda waller whose only role in any comic shes ever been in ever is to do what she does in this movie hey man is it at all possible that youve made a subconscious yet deliberate decision that these movies will always suck no matter what because thats literally the only conclusion i can draw from your ignorantass comment that or maybe youve never read a comic book or even fucking watched that justice league cartoon and you should shut the fuck up and leave your stupidass thoughts to your damn self you fucking retard

movies,removed,youre better than that dont judge me yep guilty as charged its not at all that i might not believe i am right i absolutely am its not wanting to hear those entitled little fucks speak again and the easiest way to get that done is what i did since their parents were too weak to strangle or drown them as babies
movies,removed,consumers have proven that if content is not affordable or cheap to obtain they will just torent it which is why streaming services are gaining so much traction right now i doubt you could find a show on netflix amazon or hulu that i couldent torrent with ease but i like many others want things to be quick and easy while also supporting good shows and studios

movies,removed,bruh bruh are you fucking retarded no one is cutting of the oxygen supply to a kids by holding their hand over their mouth as they cry because they breath out when they cry and when they need to breath since they cry in patterns you remove your hand for them to breath when they start whaling again simply put your hand back are you dumb on purpose also its pretty funny that you refer to a hypothetical baby as it
movies,removed,i am absolutely entitled to bring an infant to wherever i so choose i am allowed i have certain rules by which i abide to ensure i dont allow the baby to disturb others where such would be inappropriate i am not bound by law or in most instances owner policy i am certainly not bound by your whiny little beliefs as you have absolutely no more right than i do in that situation i have the right to partake of the same services you purchased following the same rules set by the guys who run the venue you snowflake are entitled when you bitch about the public infringing on you in public go back to your folks basement and pretend your problems are all caused by other generations and your aspergers and that no one understands you not that its your incredible obtuseness to blame for being lonely and underemployed im too poor to afford a babysitter i spend all my money on alcohol i wish i wasnt so lonely i wish my wife didnt leave me after finding out how psychotic i am i dont actually have a job or hobbies thats why i spend hours a day defending my shitty comments on reddit i just project and project hoping nobody notices my post history and calls me out on it ohhh i see ahhblaming your parents again no my year old and and understands the concept of consequences based on actions better than you apparently i allow my kids to make mistakes and suffer consequences no participation trophies on my team squirrel my pta meetings have been outstanding my older kids are beyond their grade level in tag participating in team sports and socially adept oh tag means talented and gifted you have probably heard of someone not you being called such team sports does not include xbox sorry you have to actually move farther than the fridge for your next mountain dew i am not sure you could begin to understand socially adept as friends are probably foreign to you i claim to be able to read its all of you that cannot that being said ill disregard what you said and continue to project what i feel rather than what youve actually wrote btw did i mention your education was shit lol millennial participation awards lol team squirrel why cant you be like my kids i mean education is so simple now adays you literally get awards for just showing up but when im talking about my children its something to brag about ah makes sense thanks for clearing it up the asperger syndrome makes everything a little fuzzy but your autistic comments seem to dig right into my skull and resonate deep inside thanks chum

movies,removed,go fuck yourself
movies,removed,i downvoted for you being a faggot
movies,removed,it wasnt the way you read it he is clearly racist temper tantrum those negroes are lucky we are even allowing them to star in our white movies
movies,removed,clears it up why some of these pictures got nominated doesnt it gets to the point
movies,removed,at least we got into college unlike most of trumps supporters
movies,removed,maybe im just being paranoid i dunno seems like if you show whites as shitty poors or as oppressors you get brownie points in hollywood maybe im just schizo i dunno also get bonus points for showing how cool and awesome it is being an artist white person in la that loves black culture ie jazz which blacks have long forsaken btw
movies,removed,so the shitty movie manchester and hell or high water are not best picture nominees simply because they show whites as suicidal losers the shitty movies hidden figures and fences are oscar nominees not because fuck whitey la la land fetisheses la artist culture hotbed of liberal insanity moonlight a mediocre movie about gay blacks in the hood is not politically motivated nomination the only nonpolitical nominations this year are arrival another mediocre to shitty boring unimaginative super over the top positive but at the same time mind numbingly depressive sci fi and a super zealot religious movie that fetishizes gore and extreme violence oh what a year for movies thanks hollywood
movies,removed,and if high brow entertainment isnt my cup of tea such as the esteemed movies above hollywood has iq approved superhero and ya fiction fare to light me right up wow thanks hollywood
movies,removed,manchester by the sea decay of whites hell or high water decay of whites hidden figures praise of blacks moonlight normalizing black ghetto culture fences scorn of whites am i paranoid
movies,removed,somenoe is niggered
movies,removed,since the nominations are out today i thought i would give a brief summary that sums up the movie in a nutshell arrival sci fi with a female lead pussy power saves the world fences antiwhite blacks discrimination hacksaw ridge world war hell or high water poor whites in texas hidden figures antiwhite blacks discrimination la la land musical in la lion i havent seen this movie but ill give a suspected summary antiwhite hindus discrimination manchester by the sea poor whites in boston area moonlight blacks gays the hood poor i hope this rundown helps the uninformed understand why some of these pictures were nominated for the highest honor by the academy
movies,removed,no i got that he was self destructive i got that he held on to all this hate for his poor upbringing for his asshole father for the white man but also was a hypocrite cheater but was trying his best to be responsible once baby was born took care of it took care of his son was a good husband besides the cheating or tried to be etc but the crux of that story the overarching theme the cloud on top of it all was oppression by whites i see through the smoke thats my gift
movies,removed,btw has anybody noticed how feminine amy adams is i dont like arrival much and i dont like this whole pussy power saves the world from brink of self annihilation and chaos storyline which i suspect is why it got nominated but i do enjoy watching amy adams she is still fascinating to watch even with minimal make up no work done and over she is the only reason this movie is any good at all
movies,removed,yup the twist here is that its also in the unbreakable universe
movies,removed,thats what the end of split hinted at
movies,removed,i was trying to get people to see whats driving some of these nominations to get to the point quick if you cant see it sorry
movies,removed,horse poop i laid out my case strongly its right there in black and white i just helped people see more directly whats exactly driving a lot of these best picture nominations
movies,removed,we got a nigger lover here folks
movies,removed,im gonna get downvoted for this but screeners is how ive been doing it for the past years
movies,removed,well you dont have to watch them all now you can wait a while and stream them on netflix amazon prime or watch them on tv its not like theyre mandatory for you or theyre some birthright of yours
movies,removed,trailer is full of promises but actual movie delivers absolutely nothing
movies,removed,i wonder why they didnt include this scene in the original release
movies,removed,whats that i use popcorn time but i even have time wait for that

movies,removed,no but seriously i forget where but there was a magazine or something that had a conversation with bret easton ellis the guy that wrote american psycho and he basically said that he thought the script for afflecks batman movie was crap and when he told this to wb execs he was at a lunch thing or whatever with theyre response was basically we dont care itll make money now its possible ellis is wrong but the fact that the dc people have figured out they can throw whatever comic book character into a movie and people will watch it regardless of the quality is pretty shitty
movies,removed,pretty much my first thought just without the autism

movies,removed,answer this simple question why should film studios built and paid for by men give their money to femicunt man hating bitches weird how harpy femicunts keep screaming about this but rather than use their money to create their own film studios and films and fix the problem they try to bully men into giving them their hard earned money
movies,removed,id actually go and see that well id torrent it
movies,removed,cuck
movies,removed,fuck society im the last one to ever give any credence to conspiracy societies but there has to be an agenda when every dc movie gets shit on by reviewers this is bullshit
movies,removed,its almost like i told you multiple times where to find it since youre apparently too stupid here are the steps step go to dccinematic there are multiple ways to get there step click on either of the stickied threads or any of the numerous posts whining about this step read the comments
movies,removed,not might be there is it may not be the full blown disney paying off reviewers conspiracy but people are definitely jumping onto the hate bandwagon initial reviews were relatively positive not a perfect movie but its fun and then that turned into ss is pretty much a huge disaster massive disappointment these heroes may be bad but their movie is even worse actual headlines pulled from my fb feed even here on rmovies the majority of redditors are criticizing the movie and they havent even seen it yet its a joke
movies,removed,did you morons read the thread title
movies,removed,i havent seen it can someone spoil me about the flash cameo
movies,removed,joke is on you piratebay is free

movies,removed,the issue that i see is that for synder or dc whoever is calling the shots when it comes to writing amd world building wants realistic characters which means making them dark and brooding ignoring the core values that made a character appealing in the first place because they either dont get why they are appealing or simply disliking the character in the first place i recall synder admiting hes not a fan of superman and a wb exec that in the when a superman reboot was being planned he wanted a less faggy superman
movies,removed,fuck you faggot mods suck my dick
movies,removed,they must also be good at making your brain revert back to primordial sludge because youre retarded as fuck in this comment chain
movies,removed,httplmgtfycomqlesliejoneswhiteracisttweets google is a magical place
movies,removed,im getting tired of morons like yourself most if not all of the mainstream media was talking about the comments that were sexist it seemed like it was a part of their marking campaign the fact people have to come out at say im not sexist before legitimately criticizing the movie is a shame even when someone does that they are still labelled a sexist in the media see james rolf tldr youre an idiot
movies,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my comment then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here

movies,removed,ill still go see it but people need to stop acting like theres a conspiracy against dc stories and
movies,removed,montalban would not have been available given his age and what im sure would be his antipathy towards working with abrams but there were undoubtedly many better choices to go with anyone who looks even vaguely aryan would have been a better choice for anyone who cares about the original backstory but abrams does not care about that faggy nerdcore only splosions and shit
movies,removed,you peoples get worked up over a comic movie did you think jared was gonna be the best joker how could you do this dc you ruined our dreams at least give us a movie with harleys ass as star
movies,removed,no seriously fuck you
movies,removed,did they just deleted scientist man video again why
movies,removed,youre a fucktard the joker is ever changing read the comics im sure you dont but give it a try dont be one of those fags that just watches a bunch of movies and relates to the joker based on what actors have played him my god man get your shit together
movies,removed,why is it political to discuss whether an issue is legit or not
movies,removed,an analysis on the marketing of a movie by a well established and highly popular movie reviewer better delete it immediately that will stop people talking about it
movies,removed,good reason you should be a mod on rmovies

movies,removed,something i have to get off my chest the scene where deadshot is apprehended by batman it makes batman look like the worlds biggest bitch and a complete arsehole fucking amazing that the director can pull this off yet not pull together a coherent story
movies,removed,from mod mail re hatespeech from allwinter via rmovies sent minutes ago is getting mad at pointless things really the way you want to spend your summer morning re hatespeech from girafa via rmovies sent minutes ago we all stand behind wants your conversation

movies,removed,what the fuck does reddit attract autismos or something its obviously a fun line because the entire movie kurt russell is trying to sound suave and macho and say these oneliners but when he says this one he fumbles and adds that last part its a joke jesus fucking christ youre a goddamn moron
movies,removed,the line is the movie dont you understand you fucking moron its not like a continuity error where his hair is combed differently or something this line adds to the enjoyment of it and anybody who isnt a complete retard like you would know that its a funny line that was spoken well
movies,removed,who cares about these nerds all their shit stinks

movies,removed,if you dont have something nice to say then dont say anything at all this is for all of you condescending assholes out there that always have something smart to say about movies you dont like what a vile piece of nonsense uttered by an ignorant weak and self righteous child you have a right to your opinion but deserve the harshest of comebacks when you try to silence others for voicing theirs where the fuck do you get off demonizing people for criticizing a movie how insecure and fragile are you to be threatened if people point out things in a movie that they dislike for you to characterize them as bullies or assholes you think the power of ambiguity the internet is the only thing that allows people to disagree on a movie face to face adults can offer their opinion about movies to one another even hyperbolic negative ones because the majority of us do not buckle under the weight of another persons opinion that is in opposition to ours how can you and people like you function in society this may be hard for you to comprehend but sometimes these elitists think about something you never thought about and hear me out can broaden your perspective on a movie or opinion that is not being elitist that is sharing opinions with each other if you are threatened they are not an asshole you are probably wrong the ease to which you hurl insults at people who disagree with you is a glaring example of the growing trend of fragility and insecurity that is spreading like a virus instead of becoming an adult you unjustly insult people who have the skills to function in society you inject malice where none exists so you can become the victim and avoid the discomfort of becoming an adult

movies,removed,emperors new clothes i dont give a fuck how long it took to film it that film is naked its about nothing nothing happens its as generic as they get down to the teacher giving the slacker student a motivational speech to get his life in order even the characters are stereotypes down to the stereotype that all step fathers are abusive alcoholics who think their step children are faggots or how about the convenience that everything works out in the end had to leave your girlfriend to go to college no worries your roommate is super cool and all of his friends are hot girls that fall in love with you the moment they lay eyes on you and the very first thing youll do when you get to your new college as a freshman is go on a hike to a secret romantic location and watch the sun set with them there wasnt even any longterm causeandeffect in the film things that happened in the beginning of the film had zero effect on the ending of the film thats not how life works people say its real but its not in real life youre awkward in public you dont have any friends for a while you dont know where your class is etc in real life you miss a highfive on occasion you want to be good at photography but youre just not you suck and part of growing up is failing all the time and realizing that everything doesnt always work out no matter how much you want it to but he never fails in this movie he wants to be a photographer hes a great photographer he wants a girlfriend bam first girl he meets at a party is his girlfriend in real life you miss a highfive in public sometimes in boyhood you just look like you might miss a highfive in public and then you watch pokemon you could film that same movie in months and replace the characters with selena gomez and justin bieber
movies,removed,probably with the way the pc culture is people didnt want to bad mouth this movie and be marked as a racist god help us when another madea movie comes out will probably be at over

movies,removed,he means niggers
movies,removed,ive seen feminists on twitter boasting about buying tickets with no intention of seeing the movie because they have no interest in it in the hopes it will get a sequel which presumably they also wont watch feminazis just like man baiting they hate men and try to ruin the things men tend to enjoy because it gives them a bit of excitement in their meaningless hatefilled privileged middleclass lives then they wave their dictionaries about whenever someone points this obvious fact out to them it wouldnt be so bad if they werent aided and abetted by the media and the government every step of the way thats what i find really galling

movies,removed,the plot of the movie is literally ancient chinese soldiers fought demons with help of foreign soldiers the and of them were nonchinese matt damon willem dafoe pedro pascal and numan acar yet nobody seems to be talking about the chinese cast they propped up matt damon in promotions because the chinese cast that are insanely popular in china are virtually unknown in the west two of the most popular young idols lu han and wang junkai dont even have avatar photos on imdb does that look whitewashing to you guys
movies,removed,what if the main character was getting ass raped by a bunch of aids infested men and they were getting multiple dicks right up his ass at once like two or three dicks in his shitter at the same time while another dude fucks his mouth in and two other guys nut all over his chest would you want to keep watching then

movies,removed,youre retarded if you think jimmy fallon has less talent
movies,removed,youre missing an important part of the story this movie is a chinese production one is a case of white people putting a white actress in a role which may have been better played by an asian actress in it because they thought they could earn more money the other is a case of asian people putting a white actor in a role which may have been better played by an asian actorin it because they thought they could earn more money the fact that it is being done by asians changes things completely sort of like saying nigger white people cannot go around calling people niggers but black people can because while the action might be same the context is completely different

movies,removed,silk is a dye are you fucking retarded
movies,removed,you misspelled appropriate
movies,removed,is the title misleading or some shit these all seem to be appropriate for james bond movies the movies are for men and boys so killing fucking sloots and one night stands are what you expect when you turn it on sjws please leave james bond alone is men dont want you making it shitty like that new ghost busters movie
movies,removed,women have rape fantasies so its cool
movies,removed,inappropriate by todays bullshit standards
movies,removed,the truth is that vast majority of women crave to be treated like that by attractive man
movies,removed,lol you are so white
movies,removed,are you retarded or did you have to try for this steaming sack of shitjuice comment batman doesnt kill anyone ding ding ding winner batman could almost be g and still get the same feel
movies,removed,asking before you do something bold takes away all the sexiness if that one night stand asked me if it was ok to shove me on the bed and rip my shorts off then it would have killed the vibe people are fucking morons about rape these days you can cross a line and apologize for it without committing a fucking rape take risks in sex its fun an surprising but only if you think the women isnt a sjw cunt most people are fine with bold moves jesus this victimhood culture pisses me off
movies,removed,is this triggering some feminist out there
movies,removed,cuck
movies,removed,for those wondering denise perrier in diamonds are forever
movies,removed,you say that as if some women arent also sadists who enjoy being forced to have sex by a powerful man
movies,removed,he doesnt its just cool to be offended by men nowadays
movies,removed,lol good video but most of these are out of context plus inappropriate and bond go hand in hand
movies,removed,
movies,removed,ok it sounds bad and i get that but my experience lines up with this being true im not saying any woman actually wants to be raped but every single woman ive ever had sex with wanted to be taken if thats what you want to call it i mean i guess theres been two casual encounters where it didnt happen and the relationship didnt continue to ever find out but out of the remaining like samples they all at least from time to time wanted the whole pinned down hair pulled hold my wrists thing which i had a really difficult time with as a young man because im super not into that i dated a girl once who wanted to use silk ties on me and i couldnt mentally handle it i cannot be restrained i nearly had a panic attack the both times i was put in handcuffs so for me when i first started a sexual relationship and it eventually came up i was like oh no i would never do that to you thats horrible and she was all uhh no i wasnt asking like to make sure you wouldnt i was saying we should try it anyway im babbling now im just saying rape fantasies to some degree or another are universally true in my limited polling
movies,removed,pretty soon having sex at all is going to be considered rape
movies,removed,fuck it lets have it all our cinegraphic history rewritten lets change it all so its its politically correct to the standards of the here and now its not all about you bitches
movies,removed,sjws get triggered
movies,removed,i attribute most of the casual racism and misogyny in the bond novels to fleming himself and to the fact that they are the product of a less progressive time period i attribute this kind of reaction to todays fashions and yes they are passing fashions where self righteous judgemental children on the internet pronounce everything as inappropriate or less progressive as part of an internet forum inspired collective hive mind of fuck wittery this too shall pass and youll all be saying similar things in the same condescending manner about what youre saying today whilst pretending you never partook of course
movies,removed,come now dont you understand how this works the people with an agenda will twist anything an d everything to make it fit theyll not be happy until a masculine figure like james bond is made out to look like some patriarchal rapist
movies,removed,maybe inappropriate for nice guy pussies who were brought up by their mothers with a feminine idea of masculinity while their dads worked an office job and barely had any relationship with the son not letting him learn anything about masculinity or being a man this amplified with the industrial revolution and about mid before that boys grew up in the field or the forest with their fathers male cousins uncles grandfathers learning all they can about being a man monkey see monkey do style from men they knew how to be manly how to treat women how to talk to women and how to be responsible and resilient beginning with the first and then the second world war mothers began bringing up the boys of course they taught them how to be nice guys feminine wusses afraid out of their minds to talk to women in a manly way and treat them so this is the reason the hippie movement turned up during the vietnam war man who grew up fighting wars and knowing that fighting in a war for your countrys goals was a normal thing to do just couldnt understand why their children were such pacifist losers who wanted to make love not war and smoke pot and act like women well they were brought up by their wives not the men so since the second world war most men in the western world are brought up as nice guys who think slapping your lovers ass is unappropriate and feminism should be worshipped hell they were bought up as women of course they will think that way on the other hand rural guys who grew up working the field or the cattle with their fathers and male relatives are much more manly than their city counterparts and instantly picked by women as the more manly option whereas nice guys scratch their heads and ponder why their crush went for a sweaty uneducated financially poor guy who mistreats her props to men who bring up their sons as real men they dont have to deal with this oh james bond grabbed a girls ass and thats sooo misogynist and inappropriate bullshit fuck you nice guys go crawl back up your mothers vagina

movies,removed,since a mod deleted my post ill ask here what is up with the moviescicclejerk sub like what exactly are they making fun of i cant quite wrap my head around what theyre going on about or what the point is exactly ostensibly its a sub reddit designed to malign people who have ardent interests in certain popular mainstream directors like quentin tarantino or christopher nolan right or is it just a bunch of people who are eager to hate on the tendencies of this sub reddit or both is it just a bunch of people who want to hate on how other people communicate and so they made a sub reddit where they can just pick on whatevers happening over at rmovies that vaguely irritates them or that they think is lame even if the object of their criticism is totally innocuous andor trifling im willing to believe that there are instances where their criticism is actually warrantedi havent visited that sub reddit in a while so feel free to point me to an example if you like part of the idea is also to belittle what they deem ignorant or pretentious or overly enthusiastic discussions about movies do i have that right so say some young person comes onto this forumsomeone who is just starting to get into filmand he or she makes an emphatic statement about his or her affection for an amply praised film like say seventhese are the types of posts the guys at moviescirclejerk would mock because theyd think its so obvious to think that seven is that good or theyd find the enthusiasm to be risible and in favour of being dismissive assholes theyd then risk insulting some random person who is just trying to express affection for a film this is a hypothetical but am i off in thinking this more or less corresponds with their derisive habits am i misunderstanding the point of that sub is it actually driven by less ugly and mean spirited motives

movies,removed,man cant stop thinking about this film its allthe greater when you realize that the core message isnt really about communication or the illusion of linear time those are important lessons contained therein but not the main thing rather the main thing is the approach to craft the elevation of subtlety quiet poise intelligence patience of the characters of the narrative of the film itself man like talk about the path less traveled its either the perfect antidote for the present moment or a horrible reminder of just how awful the moment really is

movies,removed,it should be noted that ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as i know that said in grade i took an sat test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area an iq test has shown me to be in the percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test my mothers boyfriend of years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of i understand physics better than him and i owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics hes not particularly successful as an engineer but ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it im also pretty good at engineering i dont have a degree and other than physics i dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy ive come across every question of existentialism which ive seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is psychology i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which i dont have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freuds theories im a good enough writer that im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the internet ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it i dont know if that will suffice as evidence that im intelligent im done with it though because id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii i would be against executing him in fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it id even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them i dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others i dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others but i dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them i dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc i know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things i love everyone even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone im pretty much a pacifist ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that the only time ill fight back is if the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and if i dont attack ill come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me i dont fight back ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that im never in a situation where ill be worse off after a fight if im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries i really dont care the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them id prefer to do that over killing them i consider myself a feminist i dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men and never participate in the old reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome that doesnt mean i look for places to victimize women i just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings ok when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that im kind of tired of citing these examples and im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far in closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the reddit brony community where i spend most of my time and where im pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so i guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments and uh im a pretty good moderator all that and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think now that you at least slightly know me

movies,removed,the theatre has become such a terrible place to see new films people bring their kids who cant sit still or shut up teens talk the whole time and throw shit fat people take up half your seat people bring in nasty smelling food drinks candy and food from concessions cost so much you need a mortgage despite it mostly being terrible tickets are crazy expensive too despite the experience being far worse than it used to be last movie i saw the man sitting next to me didnt speak english so the person next to him translated the entire fucking movie out loud the cinema used to be great because with the yuge screen and incredible sound it was easy to escape now its impossible to focus i wont see movies at the cinema anymore unless its nearing the end of its run and then i try to do matinees or go on weeknights but more often than not i just wait for the bluray to come out then download the torrent the only theatre experience that i really liked better than watching at home in the past decade was alamo drafthouse there is a waiter that serves food and beverages to your seat which is pretty cool i went in austin texas try the salted carmel milkshake it is ridiculously good

movies,removed,
movies,removed,some people are just born stupid ufezpaladin is clearly one of those people
movies,removed,you misread what i posted cold war politics led to the revisionism the civil war that i referred to was a few decades before that obviously at any rate armenia is only a sovereign nationstate in the postottoman era and again this is only after the socalled genocide prior to this armenia was variously part of other empires be it the ottomans the persians or the russians unlike the jews of europe who had lived for centuries under the tyrannical and manipulative rule of christian kings until some ambitious and ideologicallydriven zealots decided that they would do something rash the armenians were simply subjects of one empire or another over that same period and never suffered any systematic or historic oppression on par with the jews and since that topic keeps emerging its worth noting that the jews lived reasonably well under ottoman and persian rule as well though not so much under the russians who became famous for their pogroms the point being that there is no historic animosity by which to account for what the turks supposedly did nor is there much literature on the topic until after world war ii but during the interbellum period there would have been plenty of time to discuss the matter if it had been even a fraction of what these americansponsored stories have claimed the soviets would have been eager to assist such research at that time the apparent lack of any motives for genocide aside from the antimuslim fairytales that christians entertain themselves was precisely why i begin to have my doubts in the first place upon reading into the matter i discovered that the cause for so much bloodshed had everything to do with a de facto power vacuum caused by the turks own internal mismanagement which prompted a series of powerhungry figures from nearly every millet within the ottoman government to try their hand at taking a bigger piece of the crumbling pie the reason for the high body count that stretched across such a wide area was more a consequence of geographic placement since unlike europe where everyone had restricted movement the armenians as much as any other ethnic groups under ottoman rule were largely free to travel and live where they pleased which resulted in family relations to becoming civilian conduits for the belligerent interests and therefore they were easily in the line of fire for their turkish rivals had the armenians won instead of the turks the events which unfolded in the aftermath would have been radically different and its quite likely that an armeniancontrolled ottoman government would have found itself tempted to join with the axis powers in the same way that so many other collapsing states in europe did something that the turks never developed any desire to do fortunately the surviving armenians got along better with the communists than they did with fascists but unfortunately that made them something of a target for cold war propagandists to stick their hooks in which just may explain why the modern armenians have developed such a strange taste for that most coveted form of martyrdom we see so much of today besides for something that has happened so many times isnt it a bit odd that we can see how dr lemkin was required to mention one particular group of interest before he was even allowed to say that his own people were targeted for extermination its no wonder he choked at having to insert this nonsequitor into the debate since he probably would have been blackballed if he hadnt and without a podium to broadcast this new term genocide where would the jewish people be in this debate now as it turned out it took an entire generation to be raised with this hummingintheear for the idea of an armenian genocide to even gain currency and only after the collapse of the communist empires did this strange currency start to become of any value to the nowindependent armenian peoples having lost a few albeitdistant relatives in the nazi death camps i am quite sensitive to how the matter of the holocaust can be cheapened and debased when it is weighed down with myths and cleverlyrewritten histories so dont fuck with me about this

movies,removed,know what zack snyder is a terrible filmmaker i used to look forward to a batman movie ever since i laid eyes on tim burtons eyepopping classic of course joel schumachers batman robin doomed it for me but then christopher nolan happened those were three great movies yes even the dark knight rises i hate to admit it but i was really tempted to walk out of batman vs superman snyder really sucked out any sort of humanity that was left in his superhero movies with that one the guy is just a bad filmmaker hes riding on a visual style that is so artificial and cold it might have somewhat worked with but that movie is starting to look more and more like a fluke he adheres to a fanboy culture that is add and have no blueprint as to what a good movie should look like with all that being said i am glad hes not taking the directors chair for the upcoming batman film instead we have ben affleck directing and im fine with that affleck is more competent and has a better visual eye for action although if you watch the town and gone baby gone you will notice that he is very much influenced by michael manns heat which coincidentally was a major influence for christopher nolan especially in the dark knight im guess this will be more nolanesque than snyderesque which im fine with but i also hope that affleck finds some kind of auteuristic stamp for his film he was a decent batman in the last film as well consider me a little more hopeful about this next caped crusader venture

movies,removed,arrival is muddy narrative mixed with a confusion plot dipped in some nice visuals a film that tries to be too smart for its own good while making political undertones but cant even cover its own plot holes to come to a satisfying conclusion amy adams give a good emotional performance but honestly she can only do so much with what she is given director denis villeneuve does the best with what he haves and almost is able to salvage a passable movie but i put the blame on the screenwriter for coming up with a poor adaption to a short story
movies,removed,so facebooks censorship when they post block me and delete me for shouting nigger nigger nigger its a nigger deport them to trump and throw them over wall on somebodies picture with an africanamerican tagged in it is a violation of the first amendment and i should sue them for all theyre worth radical man so cool glad i know that the first amendment applies to the internet

movies,removed,minions are probably the greatist thing to happen in recent human history it just shows how far animation and computer technology has come and how we spent all these years developing algorithms and processors to fully render a lil chicken nugget guys huge lardy lumps complete with a photorealistic brownishyellow asshole inbetween those luscious cheeks technology has allowed humans to realistically jiggle big fat yellow fartknockers right in the theater with the glasses i saw this film in the theater and i just couldnt help but cry at the hyperrealistic buttholes which clenched and pulsate right in your face ive been buying minion toys nonstop since that changing moment of my life i am now a minionist with over reposted minion pictures across each of my social media accounts and minion toys under my literal belt i just cant get enough at those fat muffintops bulging out those tight overalls before ballooning out as the minions pants drop while they say bottom violently rumbling as they unleash torrents of rapidfire fart flashes coated so much with shitparticles it actually colors the otherwise invisible gas clouds and my favorite is when they spread their cheeks wide open and you can see all the hairs sticking out their anus look at their heads for an idea i just love seeing gru shout at the minions and getting viciously attacked by shards of shart pellets by the minions best movie of the century so far

movies,removed,i new the programs existed more or less i did not know what they were called however given the nsas budget and expenditures the reality of what is capable with technology and the legislation being passed it was pretty obvious what they were doing regardless of what the appeals courts said section was clearly a response to warrantless wiretapping outed by the ny times in there are early comments on my main account umoderndemagogue which point out that the only reason to write this into fisa this way is to provide for an ongoing program which would target anything the telecoms had on their servers and records about their network this means metadata theres really no other way to read the law from an intelligence community standpoint of course they said it was to keep telecoms from being sued but why would they need to keep them from being sued telecom immunity has to have a purpose otherwise it wouldve been limited retroactively to the past programs one has to assume that whatever is technically possible in five to ten years by the private sector depending on what type of technology were talking about the government is already doing today forgive me but its just hard to be surprised when someone tells me that the locator beacon in my pocket thats broadcasting where i am at all times is also telling the government where i am at all times its like yelling out of a window and being surprised that someone outside hears me the revelations to me actually showed that the nsa was far more concerned about the law the constitution and compliance with oversight than i had imagined for example all people involved in loveint had their security clearances revoked and many were fired or resigned the nsa was taking breaches seriously to me the way this has played out and the harm it has caused to the us makes it really just looks lie an antius operation by the russians

movies,removed,tj miller actually came to my theater when i saw this last saturday night at a press screening in nyc and he watched the film with us office christmas party is exactly what the title is its an office christmas party comedians party shenanigans what more do you want though it does bring a simple idea of throwing this party that takes place in one day the film gradually gets crazier the longer it goes on the film starts off pretty tame introducing these characters with their own personality but once the party begins the film slaps on its r rating it doesnt try to force a lot of dirty raunchy humor down your throat as it takes you by the hand and guides you there though some jokes are written for themselves as youre able to fill in the blanks on how a joke will play out later in the film youre interested in how it will affect the characters at this party the film goes from a fun episode of the office that somehow gradually ends up becoming wolf of wall street httpwwwrendyreviewscommoviesofficechristmaspartyreview

movies,removed,i liked this film a lot and for me it has a decent ranking among their filmography i can see why so many people disliked it however the movie marketed itself in one way a comedic crime caper involving a kidnapped actor and delievered something entirely different the movie is pretty much a day in the life of josh brolins character and nothing more with regard to plot

movies,removed,cucked bitch release yourself from marxism and shackels of lesfloathing and white guilt and join us in raltright
movies,removed,altright is not about genociding anyone we think that whites deserve our own space to live among people like ourselves if i would live in a society of white people i would never be accused of racism there would be no such thing as affarmative action crime rates would be far lower murder rates would be same as whites in belgium whites are tired of being built these cities and then have to flee them tired of paying all these taxes and then called racist oppressors tired of being called worst people in the world and then being faulted anywhere we go
movies,removed,segragation yes multiculturalism is a failure it recuces social cohesion and people are not happy people naturally want to live their lives among people like themselves all through history different races together creates unnecessary conflict homogenous societies work so much better when people feel their identity preserved american whites crime rates are close to whites in europe and american blacks crime rates are close to blacks in africa you claim that if whites would be segragated from nonwhites we would suddenly start to murder ourselves more what kind of insanity is that
movies,removed,its not actually an opinion you can refute like that or was it this that gave you a headache tired of paying all these taxes and then called racist oppressors scared of your welfare check paid by us and getting nothing but violence in return

movies,removed,
movies,removed,not saying the divorce settlement wasnt bullshit im saying the fact that he said he hopes his wife gets raped by a bunch of niggers and his other comments makes me not give a shit about his opinions the truth comes out when youre drunk hes a racist a misogynist and an anti semite and for the record i think nate parker probably was guilty but he was found innocent yet that mother fucker is blacklisted for a while lets see if hes back in years like gibson has been welcomed back

movies,removed,live by night is a decent movie at the core the sets are great the costume design is phenomenal and the performances are fine the problem is the tone and direction that affleck took with the movie there is no weight no real emotion the film needed a serious rewrite after the town and argo this was shocking to me affleck has the talent but he shafted this movie by not paying attention to what made movies like the untouchables and the godfather so great my review is attached if you want my full thoughts on the film
movies,removed,where is carrie fisher oh thats right shes dead 😯

movies,removed,httpimgurcomafkwxe httpimgurcomaejisk
movies,removed,i have seen of his films i believe and yes uwe boll is a bad director but he also seems to have a cando attitude and a talent to make investors part with their money which is why a while back i included this paragraph in with his energy and his ability to get projects off the ground and to get them done uwe boll would probably be a great producer and he might possibly even be a passable director if only he could be kept on a short leash he needs to be kept under tight control and be reigned in at times in order to make sure that he overcomes his thats just good enough attitude to so many aspects of his films anyone ready to agree
movies,removed,because the director directed her and hollywood is full of pedos

movies,removed,several errors in that statement to start with the film accurately depicts the kkk at its inception as a resistance movement against the union army military occupation this was under the direction of confederate general nathan bedford forrest when the kkk became a racist organization forrest quit and renounced them the film chronicles the relationship of two families in the american civil war and reconstruction era over the course of several years the prounion northern stonemans radical republicans and the proconfederacy southern camerons democrats when lincoln is assassinated his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him in the wake of the presidents death austin stoneman and his fellow radical republicans are determined to punish the south employing harsh measures that griffith depicts as having been typical of the reconstruction era stoneman and his protégé silas lynch a mulatto exhibiting psychopathic characteristics travel to south carolina to observe the implementation of reconstruction policies firsthand black occupation soldiers are seen parading through the streets and pushing white residents aside on the sidewalks during the election in which lynch is elected lieutenant governor whites are seen being prevented from voting while blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes the newly elected mostly black members of the south carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior the legislature passes laws requiring white civilians to salute black soldiers and allowing mixedrace marriages flora cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by gus a freedman and soldier who is now a captain he confronts flora and tells her that he desires to get married frightened she flees into the forest pursued by gus trapped on a precipice flora warns gus she will jump if he comes any closer when he does she leaps to her death having run through the forest looking for her her brother ben has seen her jump he holds her as she dies then carries her body back to the cameron home in response the klan hunts down gus tries him finds him guilty lynches him and delivers his corpse to lt gov lynchs doorstep there is much more to the plot and interpretations of racism are relative the film was the first movie aired at the white house by president woodrow wilson d who was himself a bitter racist and who had resegregated washington dc much of the rise of the second kkk was due to his efforts to encourage patriotic organizations leading up to world war i after a time the kkk began to focus on anticatholic antiimmigrant xenophobia with much less attention to blacks its headquarters was located in indiana
movies,removed,just got out of the movie terrible the biggest problem with this film is leslie jones im just going to say it because others are too scared to she always plays a loud black woman stereotype and she does the same in this movie every joke she makes either points out the fact shes black kind of hard to miss or is just loud sassy black lady noises it got to a point where i just felt awkward for her whenever she waddled on screen second biggest problem with this movie is that it treated the audience like it was stupid major plot holes galore i wont bother going into them im sure theyre covered else where but its not the plot holes themselves that are annoying its the fact that the movie doesnt even bother one bit to try to explain them away change the physical rules applied to the ghostbusters main weapon out of nowhere in the third act sure why not simply put dont see this movie this movie needs to be a flop to send a strong signal to studios to make better material especially when theyre handling a beloved franchise and more than anything lets hope a studio doesnt rape another franchise by inserting gender politics into a story that frankly has nothing to do with such serious subject matter
movies,removed,go eat a dick you fat dyke
movies,removed,gus in breaking bad or predator

movies,removed,stop stalking my fucking account you have no concept of reality you jumped straight from mommy and daddy then to the bf and blocked me when i pointed out how you complained about your great life if you harrass me again im just going to screenshot all of our texts and send them to nick
movies,removed,well maybe someone should make a movie about all the white men who died to end slavery black people owe a great deal of thanks to the white men who gave their lives to free blacks in the civil war and the millions of white men who have since given their lives to protect this nation and keep us all free
movies,removed,when walt just shoots the nazi dude in the head in felina
movies,removed,i survived ghostbusters and all i got was this lousy tshirt
movies,removed,saw it not as bad as most people said it would be however i felt leslie jones was really forced and kind of cast a stereotype im not sure if negroes should be allowed to participate in movies of this caliber and i would feel more comfortable if leslie could tone down the negro talk
movies,removed,well maybe we could make a film about all the black people who have killed white people you think that would help because its history maybe we could start by making a movie about the black man who just shot and killed white dallas cops
movies,removed,this entire thread is fucked and being brigaded by red pillers and angry manchildren notice how anybody who says even a single positive thing about this movie is downvoted to hell
movies,removed,i was expecting the worst but i was blown away at how amazing it was this is the godfather of comedies people will be studying the comedic genius of this movie in film schools i hope it doesnt get snubbed at the oscars but considering what happened last year with oscarssowhite i wouldnt be surprised sad but the movie was great
movies,removed,maybe it is the point i was making was that it will impossible to know if a critic is giving an honest review because of the subject matter
movies,removed,dude your a faggot excusing murder because of skin color
movies,removed,i think the cast had more fun than the audience
movies,removed,oh boy this movie is finally out
movies,removed,why did he say enslave elephants thats so political its not real world language im not in the proelephant slavery lobby im just saying it was in the new independence day also goldblum has a line about elephants
movies,removed,now i know why women make cents on the dollar the study that supports that wage gap also mentions its only the measure of the earnings of all fulltime male workers compared to all fulltime female workers doesnt even account for experience job position hours worked etc
movies,removed,noi have life you stupid fuck
movies,removed,blacks create nothing invent nothing and destroy everything it has been proven scientifically that the black race is in fact inferior to every other relevant race
movies,removed,inspire a riotous disposition thats inherent to the target audience of this film you dont need to inspire it they do it all by themselves all the time
movies,removed,this is a movie in the real world theres no african nation that is not a self generated nightmare
movies,removed,yeah those fucking laws and rules are racist black people cannot rape and murder that is fucking racist personal responsibility you say racism all lives matter racist fucking social structures like laws and rules were invented by white cis males to enslave the free black peoples culture of robbery and rape
movies,removed,gotta cashin on that juicy whiteguilt i suppose
movies,removed,blaxploitation this movie was made by jewish white owned studios and distributed by fox black people gain nothing from this race baiting bullshit the left got taken over by capitalists who use this junk for profit and politicalsocial gain its the main reason the us adopted political correctness because it reinforces the multicultural attitude that black culture history is segregated rather than being a part of overall american national identity by framing black people as constant social outsiders it lets these big companies and others the ability to keep pumping out this junk slavery ended a long time ago time to move past that it was a bad thing now get over it and maybe concentrate on current issues like black people still being stuck in poverty and broken communities and constantly called black instead of american

movies,removed,im fairly certain the owner of this reddit account received money for posting this comment the movie is terrible its bad on a level i havent seen from a movie in quite a while roeper and angry joe were deadon with their summation of the film its so far from a fine summer movie with a wide appeal is it really wide appealing to feature vagina fart jokes within the first two minutes of the movie that i just cant take anyone seriously who feels that way if this comment isnt paid than i seriously think you should consider stepping away from movies and offering your opinion ever ever ever again you clearly dont know what you are talking about
movies,removed,ive stopped feeling sad for the african americans everyone in usas history suffered immensely also african americans have it better than any other group of black people on earth get over yourself
movies,removed,is this a planet of the apes movie
movies,removed,sure are a lot of i hate white people movies coming out lately
movies,removed,arabs arent african ok debatable africa is not just subsaharian africa maghreb rings any bells but im sorry whats your point and what has it have to do with my previous comment
movies,removed,pseudoscience
movies,removed,white supremacy as an ideology that people intentionally follow whether publicly or privately is absolutely a very fringe position
movies,removed,the movie had a direct reddit reference
movies,removed,cmon you know damn well the media stirs up the racial angle whites murdered by blacks or police arent reported on but blacks killed by policewhite people is front page news
movies,removed,personally im worried theyre going to gloss over all the terrible shit nat turner did and this film will prop him up as some sort of great man that did nothing wrong in reality he murdered babies women and children if its an objectively honest depiction wonderful but in todays racial climate im thinking this is going to put nat turner on a pedestal as a hero
movies,removed,being racist takes a conscious effort benefitting from a system that systemically puts certain african americans at a disadvantage isnt racist racism and systemic racism are different things calling some racist for being part of a system that keep down a demographic isnt right they are not racist
movies,removed,address racism as a system back then maybe it was but today can you please point me in the direction of any law that is there to oppress blacks but has no affect on whites just one i dont need two because if you cant find such a law you would have to realize that there is no such thing as systematic racism in the usa today the law is same for all second you need to look at numbers numbers that tell you that whites are killed more by police than blacks are the reason blacks are killed disproportionately is because they commit crime disproportionately they are of the population and yet somehow they manage to commit more crime than any other racial group numbers that show you that blacks kill each other more than whites kill blacks numbers that show you that blacks kill whites times more than whites kill blacks and yet they whine surely this movie isnt just a propaganda piece that has nothing to do with reality but sure numbers are just the invention of the raysis crackers
movies,removed,you sound like a faggot stop it
movies,removed,no i didnt before that person deletes his comment he said the media racebaits and someone replied dont be thick i responded to that i never said there wasnt systemic racism where did that come from lol are you saying the media arent race baiting and stirring up controversy
movies,removed,the movie is targeted at women who enjoy things off of bravo and hallmark dont kid yourself sweetheart
movies,removed,wao try this also
movies,removed,what is your motive i mean the original post is over a year ago in another subreddit what profit you are talking about there is no even as advertsiment
movies,removed,i havent seen the film yet i feel like l need to ketchup
movies,removed,my only issue with this movie and especially recent shows like underground is the white people who are racist come off as caricatures like some wholly evil mustache twirling villain in a bond movie we gon show dees hur niggers somethin its so over the top and exaggerated like you either had to be one or the othera sweet pure hearted non racist or a paradoxical evil brute thats not how things were there were plantation owners who treated their slaves respectfully and humanly there were people who were prejudiced but didnt commit violence or come off as some evil villain racism isnt one or the other
movies,removed,im honestly surprised at how so few jews are a part of this movie its groundbreaking in that it has a black writer and director and thankfully no jews
movies,removed,that is actually insanely underrated i love that move
movies,removed,lol
movies,removed,i would take that with a grain of saltregardless of how many he killed it was his army he gets put in that bracket since he was their leader thats like saying saddam hussein didnt kill anyone during the iraqiran war even though his army killed over million iranians

movies,removed,this film proves once again sony has no business in the movie business
movies,removed,after seeing this movie its very obvious sony paid off critics to get the rt score it has its been proven to happen before the movie deserves as low a score as van helsing or the new fantastic it really is that bad maybe worse because sony destroyed such a beloved franchise

blacks made up nearly of the total prison population despite being only of the general population source jail inmates midyear statistical tables blacks are more likely to have a gene that causes violence source the allele of the maoa gene confers an increased risk for shooting and stabbing behaviors the poorest whites are less likely to go to prison than rich blacks source race wealth and incarceration results from the national longitudinal survey of youth there is no racial discrimination in the justice system blacks just commit more crime because of their low intelligence and high

people to not commit crime to live longer and healthier lives to earn more money to perform better at every type of job and to make better decisions source intelligence predicts health and longevity but why in a survey of top iq researchers said that africans were the least intelligent race in the world because of their genes source survey of expert opinion on intelligence causes of international differences in cognitive ability tests for people who claim that blacks poor iq scores are caused by poverty in harvard psychologists looked at how black children adopted by uppermiddle class white american families performed on iq tests black children adopted by white parents averaged on iq tests at age slightly better than the average for blacks nationally since the black children grew up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions only genetics can account for their low iq scores regardless of wealth or environment the racial iq gap remains source the science of mental ability pages what if iq tests are biased against blacks there are iq tests like the ravens progressive matrices which dont have any language or words and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition even then there is a marked difference between black and white iq scores not only in america but internationally as well in fact the blackwhite iq gap has been observed in south africa the netherlands canada and many other nations around the world source jensen effects among african indian and white engineering students in south africa on ravens standard progressive matrices for people who say that race

to their criminality the average american criminal has an iq which is the exact same iq score as the average black source century criminology a reference handbookwhat academics have to say about black intelligence or lack thereof in their own words from the peerreviewed paper the totality of available evidence shows the race iq gap still remains the average iq for african americans was lower than those for latino white asian and jewish americans and respectively our review of the literature shows that blackwhite iq differences in the united states have remained at to points or standard deviations for nearly a century from the peerreviewed paper thirty years of research on race differences in cognitive ability the iq gap between blacks and whites in the united states— points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago both races test scores rose during the century but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change for those looking to pin the lower iq scores of blacks on poverty iq is largely genetic from the peerreviewed paper genetics and intelligence differences five special findings some evidence suggests that heritability might increase to as much as in later adulthood but then decline to about after age why does iq matter from the article social consequences of group differences in cognitive ability thousands of studies have looked at the impact of mental abilities on school and job performance and large national longitudinal studies in both europe and the united states have shown that iq is related to various forms of socioeconomic success and failure nb this was revised by yours truly jillkews based on a revision byeagleshigh based on an original draft written i believe

movies,removed,she can go fuck herself just because he is her father doesnt mean she has any position to tell people how they can feel about him in relation to a movie that he made for an audience
movies,removed,
movies,removed,again everyone especially on the internet is a collection of the weakest and most pathetic pussies on the planet yes i think what she said is outrageous and although i dont have the same opinion of the people she is commenting on what she said is warranted to tell her to go fuck herself get used to it it is called course language grow the fuck up
movies,removed,jj abrams should go die and take his new feminist affirmative action piece of shit star wars with him
movies,removed,youre being a dick for no real reason the reason is a response to what she said it is justified i find it outrageous and arrogant so guess what she can go fuck herself that is how this works snowflake call other people pussies when they get upset with you i call them pussies because they exaggerate the aggressiveness of coarse language so they can virtue signal and make it sound like an aggressive act its not they are sickeningly weak theres a difference between not censoring yourself and just being rude for the hell of it of which you do not understand and by the way its coarse language yeah i noticed the typo right after i sent it you got me on that
movies,removed,that cuck haha no way

movies,removed,being rich isnt normal i find white roles like that family millar is an example boring as fuck would have been funnier if they were a white male husband a big fat ghetto mama as wife a gangster son and a white hoe daughter
movies,removed,basically what im getting out of the reviews on here is that the movie is okay probably comparable to the vacation reboot funny at some parts but ultimately dumb but enjoyable nonetheless
movies,removed,get over yourself dude
movies,removed,oppressed narr they just live in the hood more rich is white cause of history a black man wanting to start a tech company never heard of it blacks can be successful like obama if they work for it like anybody else instead of screaming oppression

movies,removed,about baltimore a single city with a single autonomous democratically elected government all im seeing from this article is that they accounted for income i literally just got a loan i can tell that income isnt the only factor and loans are typically automated with a website called phanymay idk if i spelled it right not some guy with a cigar and a stack of papers so again you present a gap a statistical gap between whites and black and assume its racism maybe theyre being declined because they have a shit credit history or because they havent been at their current job for long im getting deja vu of the feminist wage gap seems to be the same thing they steered clear of black and hispanic neighborhoods as they opened branches across new york and connecticut federal officials said they focused on marketing mortgages in predominantly white sections of suburban new jersey and long island not here or in bridgeport conn you realize black and hispanic neighborhoods are typically way more dangerous right thats why there arent a lot of entrepreneurs arent pushing over each other to go set up shop in compton the rest of it seems to be the same you realize black people on average arent supper great about paying off their loans right its not exactly a mystery why they get less loans and if youre presenting this as evidence of racism then i feel you have to answer this question how did any black people get a loan from these racist organizations did they just give out a couple to squash suspicion or is it that those are the only black people that actually met their qualification if these people are actually racist then why did they give out loans to people of color whats so special about those they steered clear of black and hispanic neighborhoods as they opened branches across new york and connecticut federal officials said they focused on marketing mortgages in predominantly white sections of suburban new jersey and long island not here or in bridgeport conn okay so now ive noticed these are all references to mortgages and loans so i guess ill just stop there no point in refuting im sure they all have the same problem
movies,removed,so it didnt bother you when they go from busting ghosts with proton packs to straight up killing them so the bigoted and ignorant overtones about race and gender were aok with you we went from movies depicting a black ghostbuster as a fleshed out respectable character to one that uses an aww nawww gurl loud black woman stereotype but its all good cuz feminism amirite gotta fight those creepy weird mras like the villain girlpower

movies,removed,
movies,removed,it has a central narrative about a middle class white male that works in the military industrial complex that makes defence weapons for a country he wishes was back in the fantasy of traditional white fairy tale his marriage falling apart is a catalyst for him seeing things differently his two cars in every garage and two chickens in every pot dream starts to fade falling down did not need to show minorities commit crime there has been a stereotype of black criminality in film for decades before the film rigfson racist ideas of asian outsiders and gooks from films about vietnam made in the years earlier it may use a stereotype but often inverts them or shows them as a horrendous over simplification it shows a society in conflict this time a white male oppressor on an actual murderous rampage rather than rodney king being beaten by a mob of policemen in many ways it is the old guard post war but aging elite amped to horrific levels a frustrated junior donald rumsfeld on steroids literally called dfens with his greatest defence being attack its far more anti white conservative male than it is any other group showing his denial and moral corruption self reliant but works for big government wants small time mom and pop stores works for an arms contractor makes weapons for defence hates minorities but does not identify with the supremacist hick wants law and order but shoots down breakfast with an uzi and cannot live with a domestic life

movies,removed,piracy absolutely would increase because of this many people would be perfectly happy pirating films but dont want to wait for quality torrents which usually take a while this would guarantee that full hd quality films are available to download for free on the day of their release this would immediately open up the film industry to the same level of piracy that crushed the music industry the only thing thats insuated the film industry from huge losses to piracy is that release window its the same reason they can no longer sell dvds piracy killed the home industry not release windows which have always been a thing even when the home industry was doing well and studios have agreements with movie chains if theyre not on board with simultaneous release or a week window then there could be some serious issues with any move to reduce the window and hollywood is seeing increasing opportunities to make money abroad in those months there simply isnt any financial incentive to close the release window its just a huge liability

movies,removed,raustralia i am a bot i link the subreddits mentioned in the title for easy navigation
movies,removed,i think the main thing that made this movie so terrible is the villain and how she became the villain and then how they defeated her it was so cheesy and felt like it was written by a grader on his lunch break and tossed it in the trash but then the producers found it and said fuck it lets use it dont change anything there was a line where she said something like tell me how to defeat your people after she already said some cheesy shit like they worship machines so i will build a better machine i dunno i cant even right now it was so bad

describe your idea
movies,removed,can we increase this discussion to bad science overall because then i would like to point at tv show that guy with his freeze gun shoots at a laser within the visible spectrum and makes the laser freeze midair the then frozen laser rod falls to the ground without triggering the alarm
movies,removed,i like how on reddit theres fair well thought out smart opinions but on youtube its just go drink bleach faggot
movies,removed,hes offering better reasons for for disliking it than you are you dumb fuck all youve done is berate people for not enjoying a film your retarded mind managed to sit through multiple times youre a hypocritical fuck and you dont even seem to realise it
movies,removed,actually there are a lot of people saying that in this comment section you dont have to look hard to see people act like youre retarded or you got paid to like the movie people are going definitely overboard
movies,removed,how do you remember to breathe breathing is reflex response which does not require the use of the cerebral cortex to initiate consciously do you get all your insults from your daughters playground friends or just pick up lines the berating point seems to have sailed over your head too he disagrees with you but to you he is confused that someone can have a different opinion if you dont know how massive of a dumb faggot youre being youre beyond help keep trying to troll people though you might get someone one day
movies,removed,just torrent that shit
movies,removed,please dont post any more videos of this guy his voice is like nails on chalkboard im not a fan of dc comics not a comic book guy at all really i really liked the movie if the movie was bad then people will stop seeing the movie but thats not happening because its a great flick it looks and sounds to me like the assholes of the world that are either way too into comic books or have a fucking bias against any superherovillain movie due to not getting enough toys as a child wants so bad for this movie to blow chunks and is just whistling out of their ass to try and make other people see it their way but honestly the critics and naysayers are all just jumping on the bandwagon or go to the movie with their arms crossed like snuh this movie is gonna suck and i cant wait to be a blowhard and tell everyone on social media about it how bout sit the fuck down and dont see the movie if youre a faggot
movies,removed,i really enjoyed the theatrical cut and the ultimate edition was an improvement despite enjoying them the movie is incredibly flawed and had major issues in the execution of important moments eg martha so im someone who thought that as a film the ultimate edition wasnt bad but it wasnt great it tried balancing too much at once and in that some powerful themes and depth suffered as a result leading to an unfocused product but hey at least it tried being something more than your standard superhero flick even if the execution was poor suicide squad thoughfucking hell hands down one of the worst movies ive seen in the cinema im a huge fan of both marvel and dc and whilst i wasnt anywhere near as hyped for suicide squad as i was for batman v superman i still went in unaffected with an open mind no matter the reviews they are all completely right the movie is an absolute fucking mess in every sense of the world fantastic four has a better movie structure and narrative im not joking fantastic four actually is better than this movie in numerous ways for a start as shit as doctor doom was hes far more intimidating than enchantress joker and whatever generic eye monsters the squad had to face its also a shame the movie is so visually uninspired the colours of the trailers completely void here its just too dark visually and it looks like shit the opening minutes is the worst ive ever seen in a movie it abruptly starts with the warner brothers logo with no build up making it seem like ive started a trailer then from there we see music video after music video of character introductions that are terribly paced and drag like fuck characters are thrown out the window with only deadshot and el diablo getting some sort of character arcs harley and joker were wasted as a pairing and characters like killer croc got entire arcs removed from the movie and now hes just a walking mutated black stereotype yay so as a huge fan of superhero movies of these characters and all things dc this movie was garbage as a huge film fan its even more fucking garbage i hope as little people see the movie as possible and if they do plan on watching it its via torrents or websites i cant wait for deleted scenes to be released so fans can sort out the mess warner brothers made of this movie

movies,removed,well youre not exactly robbing anyone at gunpoint but you arent paying for the service or the product you download the kodi client and the addons act like content aggregators you choose the show or movie you want to watch and the addons give you a list of free streams available its very useful and typically very dependable and has very obscure content as well as popular so typically what you are looking for will be there i use the exodus and addons you will want to download a version of kodi off of a torrent website as i have heard the current live version is not as stable im spacing on the version number as i am not at home to look it up once you download the kodi client you will want to download the wiper add on yo reset to factory default then download the add on installer and install anything else that looks interesting i normally just watch reruns of whatever random show im in the mood for but there are channels that play like rick and morty or and you can also watch movies that are still in theaters much like what you can get from torrents

movies,removed,the people were moving along the river as the people do in the gentle days moving from one fruitful place to another maed played the flute first a river song then a berry song then both mixed together and it was so flowing that the people began to laugh and shout resh slapped his chest and called out the names of the fathers and the deeds and it all flowed so well that we almost didnt see the old woman in the thornflower bushes she was an old crone huddled up in the bushes naked and covered with cuts all the music fell away at once and the people gathered around to take a look she was very old far into the barren years maybe even into the years of being carried i did not like the look of her right away she did not have a face of the fathers and the people but rather the hungry untrusting face of one of the wandering strangers that we sometimes met along the river even when strangers were friendly they did not know the names of the fathers or the deeds except for maybe a few but they did not say them properly or with respect other times they set upon the people killing and raping and committing all manner of hideousness i was always glad to see them go on their way leaving us alone with the mother river some of the older people tried to talk to the crone she knew some of the names of things but said them wrong i went away from the crowd and looked out into the rocky land i had a feeling that maybe she was not alone that there were other strangers with her ready to set upon us the land seemed to be empty some of our cats were with us crouching and sniffing around and they seemed unworried still i showed my chest and made signs of war in case anybody was among the rocks watching us rima saw me making the signs and laughed at me saying that she saw some lizards making signs of surrender i made a few signs of courtship towards her but with a snarling face and she ran off giggling somebody called my name i came back to where the people were gathered somebody had given the crone a cloth to cover herself and some of the women were putting good lucky mud on her cuts i didnt like this why should we waste anything on a barren old woman somebody had called me because i was the son of araed one of the great men of the people the crone had called on all the great people the leaders of the people she wanted to show us something i didnt like this either who was this useless crone to call on all the great people the crone was talking to the great people the way she said the names was all wrong but her voice was like a strong music and her eyes were very large and powerful and she moved her hands making all sorts of unknown signs the people listened to her closely and i found myself listening with them she said that she was the daughter of the river she did not have a mother and father of the flesh but her mother was the river alone i scoffed at this the stories of the deeds tell us that the ancient people came from the river but this was long ago and they were not strangers who came from the rocky lands alongside the lizards she went on talking saying that she was living with the painted backs a friendly group of strangers we had met before but that they had all been set upon by another group of strangers the other strangers were powerful and cruel and they carried all the painted backs off except her this was how she ended up naked in the thorn bush the people murmured at this when had it happened just the night before this was worrying maybe the other strangers were still around waiting to set upon us the crone asked the people to take her with us this started more murmuring she was a stranger not a person and she was an old crone she could never become a person by birthing one of the people nor could she work hard for the people she was useless maed the flute player spoke up and said that we should show her the kindness of the people the same kindness that mother river shows to us are we not useless to the river who was here before use and would be here forever i liked maed who was close kin but he liked talking and impressing people too much now we were in the gentle days and things were easy but what would happen in the dry days when everything needed to be saved and who would carry the crone when she could no longer walk the fathers did not perform the deeds so that we could carry old crones around but i did not say this because i am not good at talking and my words would seem weak compared to maeds which glittered and flowed the woman began talking in her strange way again saying that we should take her with us because the mother river would bless us with many things as she was the mothers daughter now some of the people began to scoff like i did saying that this was not according to the deeds the crone agreed with this calling these people wise and saying that some of the deeds were secret this started more talk which started to lead toward argument when the old crone suddenly strode right into the river and held her hands up and called for everybody to watch the people became silent the woman reached into the river searching for something after a moment she pulled her hands out and showed us dripping and shining in the sun three very large river clams waving the clams around for us to see the old crone claimed that this was proof that she was the blessed daughter of mother river many of the people snickered and muttered the names of the fathers everyone knew that these were the gentle days and it was easy enough to reach into the river and pull out clams the woman was just a filthy old trickster we should leave her and move on look the woman cried and she handed the clams to the great men look inside our uncle kell slipped his thick yellow thumbnail into a clams mouth and pulled it open the people pressed around him to get a look it was a nice clam with healthy meat but clinging to the shell was a large perfect pearl the women all let out little sighs and the men murmured other great men pulled open the other two clams and they both held even larger pearls all three perfectly round at this people gasped and shouted and everybody began talking at once a man might go a whole lifetime only seeing one perfect pearl pulled from the river three was a thing that had never happened before three was a thing which would live among the deeds take her with us one of the women cried and soon most of the people were saying this i found myself saying it as well the woman was surely part of a powerful flow and it was best not to swim against her but even as the great men agreed that this woman would become a part of the people and we all cheered and shouted out the names of the fathers and the deeds i found myself looking at her strange hungry face and wondering if she had not somehow slipped those pearls into the clams herself

movies,removed,is it really any coincidence both meninists and nerds are protesting this movie meninists bitter deformed physicallygrotesque virgins who have been rejected by women their entire lives for being genetically inferior male specimens unerwünscht as the nazis would refer to them nerds bitter deformed physicallygrotesque virgins who take movies far too seriously and have been been rejected by women their entire lives for being genetically inferior male specimens unerwünscht as the nazis would refer to them naturally theres a confluence of opinion taking place as the two groups share similar traits if youre over say and are emotionally invested in something as trivial as a movie like ghostbusters to the point you regard it as some sort of national treasure to be cherished and defended against a ravening horde of barbarians who the horror want to remake it frankly youre a pathetic loser as the kids say its just a movie nevermind police or lgbts i think itd be decidedly amusing watching the aftermath of a nerd massacre at a comiccon there would be absolutely no accompanying uproar as people would be ashamed to come forward and acknowledge they actually knew any of the victims

movies,removed,im kind of sad that this film got to use this name now im just a suburban white boy but from what ive read from black lead publications they are sick of seeing black people represented as slaves and that being the only way they get recognised within film i feel like you could of taken this film title a film title used by a racism fuelled film and throw it back in the face of america and instead of making it a slave film make it a story about the struggles of black people today show that true equality is currently unattainable in the sociopolitical climate and changes have to be made just my thoughts on it

movies,removed,you didnt provide a counter argument or a logical argument for anything you said probably because you refuse to put forth any sort of coherent rebuttal that isnt some bizarre temper tantrum do you not know how construct a counter argument or a logical argument for or against something youre right maybe i should add more imdb scores to my argument why are you even going through my comment history this makes me think you are one of those conservative trolls just out to troll me from some thread you got butt hurt over to see that im not arguing with some moronic troll from mcj btw i hate trump but i think its cool youre still going on this weird anti intellectual rant that apparently if a film isnt as popular as nolan or star wars its apparently bad you sure youre not part of thedonald this also proves you dont know how to read just make shit up and have serious issues with projecting might just be me but i think someone who knows how to read would realize that all the directors i mentioned have high scores on rotten tomatoes and mc or are you too busy projecting bizarre temper tantrums to realize that telling you that the budget of a film and a its popularity should not be factored in when considering if it is good or bad if only you understood the irony of this something you hipsters get off on claiming no name directors that have made or films are the best directors in the cinema nowbest in the business is a figure of speech uhhh pretty sure godard is one of the most influential voices of cinema jarmusch is pretty famous same with malick joe and hhh are well known in the festival circuit and maddin is famous in canada lonergan and nichols also have films that are poised to be nominated for best picture and alex ross perry is working on a winnie the pooh movie doesnt sound like no name to me well i am sure there are plenty of userscritics who say michael bay is the best director out in the business im sure theres plenty of imdb users that call bay the best of the business but please find me critics that arent vulgar auterists that call bay one of the best on meta critic rotten tomatoes and imdb have mediocre to decent scores uhhh manchester by the sea has on rt and is one of the front runners for best picture right now certain women has loving has queen of earth has a and the arabian nights trilogy ranges from maybe you should actually try looking at the scores instead of just saying bizarre caricatures that reddit or imdb tells you their films are viewed by very few people and rated by very few critics no id say the average of around critics on rt is pretty good just saves the time for actual critics to review the movie and not moronic blogspam or critics from sites like mtv or entertainment weekly to try to engage with it that leads me to believe that you judge the quality of a film based on how obscure it is to feel like a special snowflake yeah that must be why i praised villeneuve at the start most of the directors are pretty well known to people who actually care about cinema and their tastes dont begin and end with thinking nolan and pta are the best directors of the century the dangers of gleaning your film knowledge from imdb and refusing to watch independent cinema ladies and gentlemen not its actual aesthetic value so why is nolan on your list then xd watch more movies philistine you obviously dont know the language of film i feel like someone who understands the language of film wouldnt use imdb scores to dictate what they watch lmao or even understand that even polarizingexperimental directors are usually considered the best filmmakers rather than middlebrow mediocrities affleck also find it ironic that you want me to watch more movies while you yourself refuse to watch the directors i mentioned before because their imdb scores are low for your own sake make up your mind dude

movies,removed,brag about it
movies,removed,well me calling someone the word nigger would not be acceptable these days due to the connotations it has but if you go back before slavery it was merely a way of referring to people from a certain area i would be racist to use that now i would not have been racist to use it back then hence the context would make it okay as it would simply not have the attending meaning back then now on another instance if i were to refer to black people as being subhuman that would have been just as unacceptable back then as it is now maybe a little different given the advancements in science but roughly speaking so while you can understand it it cannot be excused i guess youre fundamentally right that it shouldnt shield it but it must be a part of the consideration
movies,removed,i feel like youre waiting for someone to ask you for a link and im annoyed you didnt just plug it right away so go ahead and see this as your window

movies,removed,display faggot checking in refresh rate isnt what it is nor is it input lag refresh rate is how often the tv draws pictures or frames not directly the same but basically your displays frames per second more is more frames smoother picture input lag is the time it takes for you to put in a command and see whatever ninja tits you are engaging flop around so these new tvs use post processing to achieve or most tvs that is there are true hz displays and such this is actually interpolated information and if you could freeze on one of those frames it would look completely natural like it wasnt a frankenstein frame made out of nothing this is basically free for video media as the audio is pumped back a tick to match making it invisible to the end user with exception of people who would get all pissy about color tv being a fad for games and such the computer is doing fps or for consoles the controller is matching that and the tv will be the in between man from your monkey brains reaction time and the computer usually between unless you got some cheap ass shit for the display or less for you wireless controller or whatever all in all pretty minimal thats tru input lag this well the tv get the picture from the computer then digitally plays with its anus and out poops those new frames stitched together with the old reg but that takes the tiny bullshit processor a lil maybe ms then monkey brain sees it reacts hits button computer does computation then displays so not only do you get the delayed show of what you are responding to you get a delayed show of how you responded so in game you get whatever minor controller input lag and thats it however its input lag that you see it so it feels twice as bad as it is at two tenths of a second thats enough to feel real fuckey dont even get me started on this in tune with ping rates

movies,removed,i saw it today and had a very mixed reaction on the one hand the directing and cinematography were simply incredible both deserve awards and as much praise as we can give the story thoughit didnt really work for me i do think it presented an interesting philosophical question of what you would do if you knew your entire life story but honestly i didnt find the nonlinear time concept to be very interesting and certainly not profound like many reviewers had claimed its a fun concept but one that reminds me more of a christopher nolan film than anything i have a strong feeling that after a few months the consensus on this film will begin to change

movies,removed,oh but it is

movies,removed,eww chinks
movies,removed,this is a mistake in this movie lets see and we look carefully
movies,removed,yeah that is what the addicts and fat people want you to think
movies,removed,yeah but that still doesnt explain how he went from being a decent looking actor on seinfeld to being a guy on some lowkey standup stage in a bar calling people niggers thats a pretty big leap and probably not one taken overnight was he just like this all the time and suppressed it or did it build up to this point thats what theyre asking i think
movies,removed,prick
movies,removed,i could understand what he meant when he called a couple of hecklers niggers with a hard r roddit
movies,removed,hes a nigger hes a nigger hes a nigger was there even an attempt at comedy there
movies,removed,theres a hell of a difference between just saying the word nigger and actually calling people that
movies,removed,or the nigger guy i really hope people get that i am joking i feel for the dude and that word isnt too nice either so i kinda get how his career imploded after that being nonpolitically correct can be fine but the way he went about it was not
movies,removed,but louis ck wasnt being racist he was just pointing out a funny aspect of the nword that being by saying the nword it forces everyone to mentally say nigger how is that racist
movies,removed,you mean to say lose loose is your moms vagina d

movies,removed,i can kind of understand it my friend who is white got in a fight with a black dude over something stupid anyway he got heated and called during the fight and called this guy a nigger i was shocked to say the least considering hes not like that at all so after everything was over and he had calmed down i asked him why he said that he was clearly mortified by it and he just said i was just so mad at him in that moment that i just wanted to say the worst thing i could say to him and that came out i told him that he looked like the idiot when he said that and he knew he did but he just wanted to hurt the guy verbally in that moment and he knew that saying the nigger was the worst thing he could possibly say if that logic makes any sense kind of made me understand the kramer thing a bit more its not justified but at least i understand it kind of

movies,removed,i saw this movie last night and im still shaken by it i tend to be a bit of an emotional android and overly aware that what im watching is just a movie its tough for movies get get strong emotional responses out of me but this one sure did maybe its because the story lands too close to home for me while im not gay or black this is the closest ive been to seeing my life put on screen in front of me so many aspects of chirons life parallel mine down to he drugridden neighborhood derelict mother vicious bullying and breaking bad the scene where the woman tells him if he were a man there would be four other knuckleheads there with him put me as near to tears as ive been in a decade i heard some version of that comment so many times it breaks you because its justifying others being a piece of shit because you are not one yourself if only you would be less than who you are the wold would accept yousoul crushing im a bit tied up in this movie so im probably biased that ceded its the movie of the year imo and possibly the decade i love how its shot there is a visually interesting cyclical pan they use a couple of times that seems like a take on the linear pan used in films like birdman and revenant its less gimmicky and helps to focus the environment on the people in it there is this great mix of earthy grit mixed in with beautiful shots like the neon room scene that was especially powerful given the darkness of the moment castingacting is great the three actors that portray chiron all draw you in with their broken humanity trvante rhodes is able to overlay brokenness with a sort of fuck it hardness any flaws are nitpicks but here they are janelle monae everyone else is hyper realistic and low key except for her looking like a hollywood dime she stuck out a bit juans death felt like a huge missed opportunity he dies between chapters and they only mention it once indirectly there was a lot of emotional investment there that was lost but the film glosses over it i had a bit of an issue with juans role in the film too this is the story the film chose to tell me and its not impossible or anything so ill take it at face value but ive never met any benevolent drug kingpins my mind was in a dark place when he started to mentor chiron ive seen hustlers take kids under their wing and its always to get them into the game i suppose that is inadvertently what happened but his motivations were a bit idealistically pure

movies,removed,stuff like this makes me pirate clean blu ray rips myself internet pirates can be total snobs and someone in the comments section will always point out if this torrent for seinfeld season is sped up or if a certain copy of the shining is in an incorrect format or missing the crucial interview at the start of the european version netflix has no comments section so you kind of have to just hope they got it right if kindle didnt tell you if you were reading a full or abridged version of any particular book then people would be upset but when it comes to tv and movies the distributors and broadcasters dont really seem to give a toss

movies,removed,seeing michael sheen is a pleasant surprise im not sure about this though but i will definitely see it cautiously optimistic though i thought part of the original plot was that he woke her up i kept expecting to see that reaction because if i were her id fucking kill him not sure if they changed it or if theyre just hiding it
movies,removed,i would advise not reading it though because itll be a delight to watch it unfold on the big screen without knowing whats coming
movies,removed,what an ama
movies,removed,you know when its coming out in torrents or where i can find it online yet
movies,removed,goddamn ive been looking for it literally every weekend on all the torrent websites and amazon and google play i wonder why theres so much delay i never heard one single negative review of the movie might as well release on demand and make some money
movies,removed,fo real though ma nigga the amount of sex
movies,removed,well for one he is british so fuck him he gets no say in our elections fuck foreigners that think they need some sort of say in our politics for another hollywood is a sea of liberals i mean the dems having hollywood in there back pocket is something that has been going on for decades and decades for him to say you know hollywood is racist really can only go one place that a large dependent piece of the democratic party is racist instead the the little twerp goes you know hollywood is racist therefore donald trump fuck this guy
movies,removed,or maybe if you werent such pussies and did youre share of the lifting we wouldnt have to who comes to the rescue for damned well everything americans who gets blamed for not taking any action in some damned overpopulated undereducated country americans germany nope europeans nope british nope china nope americans the rest of the world isnt lifting there weight
movies,removed,oh my god are you fucking retarded
movies,removed,dont worry i am sure the story is very different its not about couple that wake up years early and then fall in love but get cucked by solar flare storm which then the man must sacrifice himself to fix the ship and then the girl forced to wake everyone up to save them
movies,removed,seems to be used as shorthand for cockblocked in this case get cockblocked by a solar flare storm is cucked the new shit in that you can use it in any context how long until this thing is the cuck becomes a positive attribute like for shit

movies,removed,who dis nigga up on dat nag
movies,removed,the fuck you care about spoilers if you read the script nigga
movies,removed,
movies,removed,your argument is basically that every single thing should have some equal representation of only black people there are no white channels blacks have bet you ignored everything i said regarding black dominance of the music scene and everything else we arent obligated to force black characters into everything for the sake of peoples feelings you dont even care about other minorities who are featured wayyyy less than blacks you have no argument youre just butthurt your fiancee is probably a weak beta male that you use as a doormat
movies,removed,stop being a cunt people are allowed to like things without being delusional
movies,removed,a slur to white men the word arose from the sexual practice of having the white wife have sex with a bull — a large black man with a large penis — in front of the white husband who was cuckolded he is the cuck when rthedonald users and white supremacists but i repeat myself use the word cuck they are explicitly stating that the nominally white man theyre addressing is weak and is allowing his women to be miscegenated fucked by black men
movies,removed,you say youre white but i cant just take your word for it sorry my argument is that there is enough black content out there there could be more latino and asian stuff though the blacks are complaining about everything as usual
movies,removed,i change the word cuck to poopyhead surprisingly makes the donald supporters looks more intelligent
movies,removed,what exactly is it supposed to mean now i thought it was somebody whose wife cheated on them but people seem to be using it more like you fag now it seems
movies,removed,lmao its not the greatest show ever but its a lot of fun for what it is way to be an uptight faggot for karma though
movies,removed,well popstar was terribly marketed would never have heard of it if not for it popping up as a popular torrent like by then its too late if thats the first time i hear about it and thats the marketings fault i actually doubt they even screened it over here but still hot rod was pretty obscure too heard of it when it was on dvd because it was an underappreciated gem
movies,removed,i watched it online you can watch it here click the proceed to video button and then wait for the video to load
movies,removed,my god just look at all the ea battlefield gifs that cropped up so blatant
movies,removed,confirmed for cuck

movies,removed,amazing set of tits glads theyre in the spotlight
movies,removed,i thought the twist was executed perfectly when kevin as the beast was climbing on the walls i was losing my interest slightly as the movie was so grounded in reality up to that point the unbreakable twist confirmed that it was a superhero world with the hordes ability being that he has super strength it was a perfect tie in and personally i cant wait to see what shyamalan does in the third installment of the unbreakable universe
movies,removed,mostly bernie fans so they dont really know much about how life works outside of university
movies,removed,i thought you were joking so i looked it up holy fucking shit the jewish nepotism of hollywood never ceases to surprise me his mother is jewish and his father was of scandinavian descent lindelof celebrated his bar mitzvah in teaneck where he attended synagogue for the sabbath he has stated i was a jewish white kid growing up in teaneck
movies,removed,i cant figure out why studios keep hiring him when in doubt look up the background his mother is jewish and his father was of scandinavian descent lindelof celebrated his bar mitzvah in teaneck where he attended synagogue for the sabbath he has stated i was a jewish white kid growing up in teaneck this is why hollywood is producing flop after flop jewish nepotism leads to extreme over representation of white upper class jewish males in executive positions ans they in turn only greenlight the same shit that appeals to their narrow background and experiences for all the talk of diversity this is one issue that never gets raised we need more diversity in the executive and decision making positions instead of throwing a token minority actor in every movie
movies,removed,pure propagated kike garbage
movies,removed,i fell for the bait in hell or high water
movies,removed,yeah ok its just a coincidence that of the population is so highly concentrated here and also a coincidence that he can produce flop after flop and still get work whereas other people have their careers destroyed by even a single flop and fuck off with calling me racist i want more diversity in the movie making process

movies,removed,a good way to not be ignorant is to read the fucking article retard
movies,removed,having been lucky enough to see this last night uk advanced preview i would urge everyone who hasnt yet seen it to do whatever they can to avoid the spoilers and get out and see the movie asap seriously stay off the internet as there are too many wankers who get off on ruining other peoples fun the movie is utterly fantastic and in my opinion better than force awakens and even most of the earlier episodes i still cant decide whether it tops empire but im going to watch it again tomorrow so hopefully i can decide then the following is pretty vague and doesnt really spoil anything but avoid it if you want to know absolutely nothing before watching spoiler
movies,removed,then youre dumb seriously if you are an adult and tpms plot is beyond your comprehension you are dumb
movies,removed,seriously loved it cant find too much to fault it really its not perfect but its a damn good insight to how a prequelstandalone film should be done
movies,removed,justjust shut the fuck up delete your account dont talk anymore shut the fuck up
movies,removed,so glad they didnt force a love story between jyn and cassian but ended with a nice hug
movies,removed,i enjoyed the movie it was incredibly compact i would prefer more loose story telling with longer run times because those little side stories and idle time is what makes you feel like you are in the universe this movie had pretty much none of that and everything took the story forward there wasnt really any wasted scenes or screen time the story is nice and compact and ties nicely into the original trilogy expanding their story as well i just wish theyd give longer shots of those battle scenes because they are so much of the wow factor they do follow whateverwings for a few seconds but it would be so amazing to have longer cuts where the camera follows live action i wouldnt say this goes into my greatest movies list but it was great well thought out i would definitely rate this movie a success
movies,removed,i just got back from my screening its not a perfect film but its good throughout without ever dropping in quality its well made and the special effects are just cool every character has their moment and its never cheesy or bad its always done in a way that makes you care about them darth vader was used sparingly and to great effect the film has no mistakes like the force awakens had you always understand what the relations are between all the characters and groups and youre always aware of who is where doing what its never cluttered they didnt use the traditional swipes or the crawl text at the beginning of the movie which make it seem like they did try to distance themselves from other star wars movies the music reflected this as well sometimes using the first note of one of the leitmotivs we know so well only to fall into another melody personally i wouldnt have minded if the music was more starwarsy there are some moments where the music tries to be dramatic but it doesnt quite work overall the score is still good just not as noticeable i would definitely recommend this movie its a great story that stands on its own while still seamlessly blending into episode it has great action scenes and great character moments i think i like it more than the force awakens but in a very different way if that makes sense im going to see it again soon﻿
movies,removed,just saw it i liked it a lot very pleased how few callbacks there were to the other series not much more to say go see it id like to take issue with chris stuckmanns review it essentially starts with minutes of masturbating over how big a fan he is as usual followed by some pros one of which is praising the film for standing on its own two feet then he spends the next minutes whining over how vader wasnt in the movie enough the less pandering to the audience the better although rogue one does do it a bit it wasnt enough to become eyerolling in my opinion
movies,removed,jar jar tarkin vader punning location titles some quibbles about an otherwise decent film
movies,removed,just saw it and its for sure that star wats feeling and ill give it a solid loved how it ended omg and the new android is 🔥 af if you like sw youll like this one too for sure

movies,removed,are you fucking retarded graphic violence gets you am r rating in the us i genuinely dont understand where this dumb argument comes from and why so many morons online keep repeating it also this movie features the beheading of a human character so by your definition you should agree with its r rating
movies,removed,fun fact sweden produced a lot of legal child porns in the and we are not talking about year olds more like year olds unfortunately the stupid chirsitans eventually banned it fortunately these materials are still archived in sweden public libraries which you can check out or watch it in library dont believe me google it so there is clearly a culture difference and i only hope one day usa could become as progressive as the swedes and even more
movies,removed,wholeheartedly agree also dont try to regulate sex with children via the law a lot of children actually love it
movies,removed,most people on reddit are americans so they have issues with sexuality just like in radical muslim countries the us is heavily influenced by religion thats why they love violence but cant handle sex its how europe was in the medieval times but those place never evolved to get rid of religion i mean what can you expect if even a left wing president keeps mentioning fucking god every time he opens his mouth
movies,removed,im really pissed that our movies dont have more rape scenes the bad guys can do any number of cruel acts but no they are all gentlement when it comes to a captured lady who is stunningly gorgeoous the worse they could do it to tortue and kill her
movies,removed,please
movies,removed,its not molesting if they like it the only harm done is the societal stigma that convinces the kids that it is wrong its the same thing with gays
movies,removed,couple this shit with the influx of rapfugees and sweden isnt going to look blonde at all in years which is exactly the plan
movies,removed,this looks like the fake movie posters you see on torrent sites and download sites like icefilmsinfo

movies,removed,blonde hair and light eyes totally asian general armstrong asianest mother fucker alive
movies,removed,even the most weeaboo anime dork will say that theyre not asian its pretty baffling that they wont be just like attack on titan where they say in the story that literally one person in the entire city is asian while everyone else is european
movies,removed,kevin fag

movies,removed,looks like the curse of gamebased movies still hasnt ended yet and now im pretty worried about assassins creed
movies,removed,who cares lol fans have doubted wow much more intense who gives a shit about them fuck you all you so called professional reviewers if you havent played the game you can never get the spirit of it for azeroth
movies,removed,so what ive picked up so far is that its not getting great reviews from critics in the us but is doing well almost everywhere else also that kotaku review made me physically ill how anybody still takes them seriously is beyond me
movies,removed,me waiting in the cinema for movie to start father is it over at long last no fan waits forever my son i see only hype before me lights go out no bad reviews are gonna destroy my excitement for this thing its been years of waiting azeroth deserves its movie fans
movies,removed,next one is assassins crees right
movies,removed,he wrote kevin fag
movies,removed,twenty five years in and the closest thing we have to an almostdecent bideo gaem movie is mortal kombat
movies,removed,its okay fans of the franchise are probably used to horrible plot by now
movies,removed,i dont know why im on reddit or why i look at reviews reddit can be so toxic and critics can be pseudointellectual asshats sometimes
movies,removed,we are worse actors not fair gibsme special treatment
movies,removed,uarielmayer wow fans will adore it everyone else will think its pretty good thats certainly enough for me disagree
movies,removed,theres finally an asian sitcom on tv and they name it fresh off the boat they should have just named it famiry ties
movies,removed,you might want to moderate the comments in the poll i dont think niggers are filth is relevant to the movie
movies,removed,latino aint a race your white deal with it you spanish ancestors were the worse of the worst and guess what they are white not latino
movies,removed,nigga you need a httphackthemenucommcdonaldssecretmenumcgangbang in your stomach arteries
movies,removed,bd wong is fighting for visibility ive seen that nigga in everything since oz and law order back in the day shit i was rewatching the xfiles and here comes bd wong
movies,removed,they would have better visibility if it werent for all that squinting im so sorry plus this joke doesnt even make sense
movies,removed,not saying they wont know what they are spending their money on smith has to make money off this and hes not being paid million to act its million to produce a film im so glad you posted to tell someone else they dont know anything and yet said nothing about it you fuckbag
movies,removed,i guess you know that the best with so much experience doing it have a happy cirle jerk time with your reddit buddies
movies,removed,
movies,removed,autism threat level in this sub right now orange
movies,removed,lol yeah poor asian americans who make more money than the native europeans and are better educated cry me a fucking river they all have their own film industries back in their own countries anyways and you know if they start getting more roles theyll take them from white people and the kikes will keep theirs the whole industry is disgusting

movies,removed,had a feeling it wasnt going to be grea didnt think they trailers look great sounds it is medicore im a wow player but i may pass it till dvd movie ticket prices for me are too expensive for anything lower than good
movies,removed,so what im managing to see in this thread and on this sub and from early us critics seems to overly harsh and negative considering it got great reviews from german critics and the french audience loved it while sites like the wrap and variety panned it for the stupidest of reasons look im excited about it ill admit but the feeling i get on this sub is that this is a movie that you guys want to fail
movies,removed,all they have to do is open their eyes a little bit more
movies,removed,someone should tell them to stop squinting
movies,removed,ya because its a primarily white country you dumb faggot there are plenty of asian actors in asia theyve dominated that scene for quite awhile why dont you go bitch that their movies dont have enough blacks in them you moron youre the same kind of person who would suck a trannys cock and convince yourself you were pleasuring a woman
movies,removed,what im getting from all these comments is the movie is not bad its just mediocre although with amazing cgi although if youre a fan you are are very likely to like it alot seems about right
movies,removed,is it because their eyes are so slanty they cant see well thats gonna be quite a fight
movies,removed,asia for the asians africa for the africans white countries for everybody everybody says there is this race problem everybody says this race problem will be solved when the third world pours into every white country and only into white countries the netherlands and belgium are just as crowded as japan or taiwan but nobody says japan or taiwan will solve this race problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them everybody says the final solution to this race problem is for every white country and only white countries to assimilate ie intermarry with all those nonwhites
movies,removed,asia for the asians africa for the africans white countries for everybody everybody says there is this race problem everybody says this race problem will be solved when the third world pours into every white country and only into white countries the netherlands and belgium are just as crowded as japan or taiwan but nobody says japan or taiwan will solve this race problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them everybody says the final solution to this race problem is for every white country and only white countries to assimilate ie intermarry with all those nonwhites

movies,removed,how am i just noticing the runtime of this film and minutes really
movies,removed,wow are you fucking stupid
movies,removed,might help if they stop squinting
movies,removed,what if they get plastic surgery that keeps their eyes open
movies,removed,theyre always going to have trouble with visibility as long as their eyes are squinty
movies,removed,if the entire movie was them in the animus it would basically just be a period piece film and a total piece of shit or far more interesting clearly neither of us have seen the movie but from having played the games focusing on the present seems like as a setup for a dumpster fire no one cares about it and frankly the movie would probably work better entirely ignoring that shit sure you lose the genetic memory and animus aspect but you get the benefit of losing the entire crap story
movies,removed,theyre also free to torrent just sayin
movies,removed,another disgusting propaganda film out of hollywood do people actually believe this httpimgurcomahqfry was really any more important than any other nasa employee garbage revisionist history

movies,removed,la la land i just cant say enough about this movie a simple and beautiful plot made into a fantastic little movie not a fan of musicals but this movie really blew me and honestly might be my favorite movie ever
movies,removed,theyve been free for years on various torrent sites

movies,removed,bye mtroll
movies,removed,i dont understand why you are so mad im not the one downvoting you im only asking why you are steering this discussion to a place where its irrelevant to my reply to op are you having a bad day and you need to pick an argument over the web please continue to spew your retarded thoughts this discussion has run its course
movies,removed,what are you a fuckin faggot
movies,removed,calm yourself nigga
movies,removed,you seem like a hormonal teen still in the closet
movies,removed,not so cool when you need to be on the run i guess you never made an apology to a friend after you have fucked them over just so you know it doesnt immediately make things better tony didnt magically forgave him turning a blind eye to their actions doesnt mean he is ready to forgive him yet but yeah since you probably spend most of your on reddit and never having real relationships with people i doubt you understand that at all good job keep downvoting ufukyermum
movies,removed,american sniper was jerk off material to testosterone driven white christian male gunnuts it was fucking didgusting and i thkught i was in nazi germany when i accidentally watched part of if at a friends house i actually got up and left i dont need to watch a movie about fucking white christian gunnuts murdering freedome fighters in a country where the religion literally means peace like im an atheist but islam is a hell of a lot better than christianity in terms of promoting inclusiveness and understanding
movies,removed,why on earth or tattooing would it be that
movies,removed,and torrent sites in half that time
movies,removed,oscars will be ghettotastic
movies,removed,chill nigga
movies,removed,ohh poor indian waiting for the torrents here
movies,removed,gays r dum amiright lol fags me
movies,removed,in the past years it would be offensive however prior to the it was accepted in films as humor bill teds excellent adventure the two of them hug the jump back and call each other fags teen wolf running gag that people think mjfs character is a fag and that hes at least glad the wolf curse didnt make him one blazing saddles used as an insult for comedic purpose also worth noting the climax is loaded with homophobic jokes
movies,removed,well this is sure to be boring as fuck
movies,removed,ha forgotdidnt get the balloon connection i just kept thinking he was obviously talking about murderin foos i was like yo muh hommie da clown nigga you sound like youre trying to be more subtlewelcoming than you think you is

movies,removed,well what did you expect you cant talk shit about the people who actually control the entertainment industry they only proved him right by blacklisting him
movies,removed,haha not condoning what he said but can you imagine the amount of unbridled rage youd need to feel to tell someone that you hope they get raped by a pack of niggers
movies,removed,the ending with the ships so crazy came across like ufos landing but actually happened
movies,removed,he was still getting work after the antisemitic stuff it was only after the pack of wild niggers call went public that hollywood disappeared him
movies,removed,yeah my friends and i are pretty terrible and say worse shit but much like louis ck explains i think we dont believe it but its the reaction thats hilarious mel gibson though he might actually hate him some niggers
movies,removed,boo you whore
movies,removed,oy vey da gentile retoins
movies,removed,i agree but that whole get raped by a pack of niggers thing was not
movies,removed,rdj on gibson nobody should make a case for somebody who just wants forgiveness but hasnt changed but hes a fundamentally different guy i think it was just the very worst aspects of somebodys psyche being treated as though they were the blanket statement about a person gary oldman on the incident mel gibson got drunk and said a few things but weve all said those things were all fucking hypocrites the policeman who arrested him has never used the word nigger or that fucking jew mel gibson is in a town thats run by jews and he said the wrong thing because hes actually bitten the hand that i guess has fed him some jewish guy in his office somewhere hasnt turned and said that fucking kraut or fuck those germans whatever it is we all hide and try to be so politically correct thats what gets me httpwwwtimesofisraelcomrobertdowneyjrforgivemelgibson
movies,removed,aka the long nose bear
movies,removed,hes a racist asshole from wikipedia by age wahlberg had developed an addiction to cocaine and other substances at civil action was filed against him for his involvement in two separate incidents of harassing africanamerican children the first were siblings of each other and the second incident was a group of black school children on a field trip by throwing rocks and shouting racial epithets at wahlberg approached a middleaged vietnamese man named thanh lam on the street and using a large wooden stick knocked him unconscious while calling him a vietnam fucking shit that same day wahlberg also attacked a second vietnamese man named hoa johnny trinh punching him in the face he believed he had left his victim permanently blind in one eye trinh was interviewed in december by the daily mail he revealed that he had already lost that eye during the vietnam war and did not know the identity of his assailant prior to being contacted by the media according to court documents regarding these crimes when wahlberg was arrested later that night and returned to the scene of the first assault he stated to police officers you dont have to let him identify me ill tell you now thats the motherfucker whos head i split open investigators also noted that he made numerous unsolicited racial statements about gooks and slanteyed gooks
movies,removed,a lot better shit than you youre fucking autistic mate
movies,removed,can we discuss how everyone is and was upset because he was an antisemite but no one cares that he suggested that if she got raped by a pack of niggers she would be to blame
movies,removed,speak for yourself ive never called someone a nigger
movies,removed,oh please youre the biggest nigger guy in washington
movies,removed,just like we shouldnt use retarded right stop being offended for other people makes you look like an attention whore
movies,removed,ive definitely thought a lot of bad things in my life but i also dont beat my spouses and tell them they should be raped by a pack of niggers
movies,removed,a lot of people have effed up and said racist things ive never threatened my wife and told her you look like a fucking pig in heat and if you get raped by a pack of niggers it will be your fault there was a pattern of shit like this from him good on him if hes changed but its not like he accidentally let one slur slip the guy was aggressively terrible
movies,removed,im a gay man im saying fag in a positive way not as a slur
movies,removed,but its true hollywood is run by people who are jewish its a fact mel gibson does not like jews thats a fact
movies,removed,i agree with oldman to a pointbut to be fair i have never said anything to anyone even closely resembling i hope you get raped by a pack of niggers and i dont believe the majority of the population has either
movies,removed,amazon the pirate bay or rarbg
movies,removed,let me know next time you tell your girl to get raped by a pack of niggers like mel gibson did
movies,removed,yep all terrible things shouldnt have hit his ex wife where did he threaten to rape her he said he hoped she got raped by a pack of niggers but thats not a threat its a wish theres a difference he said vile fucked up things in the heat of the moment with someone most likely antagonizing him since the call was edited you dont know what she said to set him off doesnt make it right but changes it a bit no tapes shouldnt have been released anyways this culture of holding actors personal lives under a microscope is gross also people deserve second chances and he hasnt done anything since so maybe his whole career shouldnt be taken away know what he didnt do drug and rape a kid huge difference between him and polanski
movies,removed,
movies,removed,yes you now officially have permission for that also you can call anyone who thinks otherwise a faggot welcome to the internet
movies,removed,typical jews
movies,removed,boss nigger
movies,removed,you forgot pack of niggers
movies,removed,dont forget the classic romcom you look like a fucking pig in heat and if you get raped by a pack of niggers it will be your fault
movies,removed,from the man who coined the expression i hope you get raped by a pack of niggers
movies,removed,the problem is after the fucking jews shit a few years later he said he hopes his wife is raped by a pack of niggers at that point he was a liability not an asset i dont know whose dick he sucked to get back into their good graces after being shown to be an actual racist but he wont get a cent from me
movies,removed,beating women and saying that they should get raped by a pack of niggers
movies,removed,do black people control hollywood too i hope you get raped by a pack of niggers mel gibson
movies,removed,
movies,removed,yeah alcohol just reveals your true feelings even when im drunk id never wish for someone to get raped by a pack of niggers thats not emotional turmoil thats just revealing what you really think
movies,removed,great camera work but ultimately i was underwhelmed by it kind of fell apart in the third act and the setting up for a sequel was just bizarre
movies,removed,what your friends dont say porchmonkey
movies,removed,but it is the white people that are being targeted for being too present in certain things the average person has no clue its more about jews than white ppl
movies,removed,am i the only person that doesnt give a flying fuck if a white man says nigger in a moment of blind anger
movies,removed,that girl like to do strange things with her beaver
movies,removed,for real when i want to watch a movie thats not available to stream im basically fucked yeah i know i could torrent stuff but i dont so i guess its my own fault
movies,removed,a white guy saying nigger to a black guy
movies,removed,thoughts and instincts arent the same thing though for example you could be saying the word nigger at the top of your lungs when youre very drunk but youre saying it because even with low inhibitions you know its a provoking thing to say drunk people are often provocative due to alcohol myopia meanwhile youre saying that because theyre saying that provoking word they must harbor racist thoughts in their head guessing their intentions when you have no cause to do so
movies,removed,nah its just a disgusting word that has no place in my life if i need to talk about it i just say the nword when would you ever need to say it oh yeah a white man says nigger in a moment of blind anger when you are throwing a racist temper tantrum
movies,removed,when he was arrested for drunk driving he made sexist racist comments toward the arresting officers calling the female officer sugar tits railing against jews and doing the whole do you know who i am thing later his wife recorded him saying things like if you get raped by a pack of niggers itll be your fault while discussing the way she dresses and telling her that she fucking deserved it when she accused him of punching her twice in the face and breaking her teeth while she was holding their child theres a good or minutes of phone calls between him and his wife where he sounds like a ranting raving lunatic which depending on your sense of humor may also be quite hilarious he has some amazing lines in the recordings those two things are the main reasons why people soured on him
movies,removed,httpnoomnoomkocom
movies,removed,why is it antisemitism to say the jews control hollywood and american media they absolutely do
movies,removed,zach is a fat faggot leftist like most hollywood retards
movies,removed,jews shouldnt have that much control over american media when they are of the population shit like this is why germans got pissed at the jews in the century because they always try to infiltrate and dominate and control the narrative of countries that they are minorities in
movies,removed,httpnoomnoomkocom
movies,removed,backdoor sluts
movies,removed,the jews finally forgive me because they want money
movies,removed,because hollywood has a lot of jew pedophiles running it so naturally they will support a pedophile while renouncing someone who is perceived to be antisemitic
movies,removed,like pack of niggers which is common for all drunk people
movies,removed,he told his wife he hopes she is raped by a pack of niggers racist enough for you im still willing to give people a second chance just saying you should know whats being discussed here if youre going to chime in
movies,removed,sweet gas the kikes race war now
movies,removed,should just have a new on torrent weekly thread thats what most people want anyway
movies,removed,
movies,removed,except youre ignoring the fact that tyson didnt flee the country he went to fucking prison so either you think we should continue to punish people who have served their time and paid their debt to soceity because you ahve a bug up your ass about the crime they were convicted of tyson never admitted or confessed to rape a jury of his peers saw the evidence presented and didnt sympathize with him im not saying he did or didnt do it im saying he was convicted served his time and was released on parole so its nothing like roman polansky who fled the country mel gibson did not in any way repay or repent for his shit attitude and anti semetic remarks not to mention that whole
movies,removed,i was just kidding altright faggot go back to the basement to write your norse epics and jerk off to american renaissance videos keep stunting your social maturity down in that jerkoff dungeon
movies,removed,edit dont know why op deleted his post me neither maybe a mod did here are the quotes again rdj on gibson nobody should make a case for somebody who just wants forgiveness but hasnt changed but hes a fundamentally different guy i think it was just the very worst aspects of somebodys psyche being treated as though they were the blanket statement about a person gary oldman on the incident mel gibson got drunk and said a few things but weve all said those things were all fucking hypocrites the policeman who arrested him has never used the word nigger or that fucking jew mel gibson is in a town thats run by jews and he said the wrong thing because hes actually bitten the hand that i guess has fed him some jewish guy in his office somewhere hasnt turned and said that fucking kraut or fuck those germans whatever it is we all hide and try to be so politically correct thats what gets me httpwwwtimesofisraelcomrobertdowneyjrforgivemelgibson
movies,removed,you look like a pig in hear and if you get raped by a pack of niggers its your fault mel gibson
movies,removed,
movies,removed,he called his his ex wife ranting about how she deserves to get raped by niggers for wearing sexy clothes i would forgive him he was obviously very insecure and lost at the time and im sure plenty of directors do worse in private but the world heard it
movies,removed,its not only about the drunken antisemitism its mainly started to go down after the raped by a pack of niggers thing and he wasnt drunk
movies,removed,yeah i fucking hate that mindset a movie or tv show or play are not real and can be in a world with different rulesthose rules should be explained if the information is necessary to the story but like you said reddit fags want things to be told visually like preschoolers wanting only picture books what the actual fuck
movies,removed,fuck those jews i just dropped a hard j
movies,removed,actually he was blacklisted after the raped by a pack of niggers rant like somebody say this isnt a jewish conspiracy
movies,removed,during the get raped by a pack of niggers rant he wasnt drunk at all
movies,removed,again he wasnt drunk at all during his raped by a pack of niggers rant this isnt only about a one time antisemitic rant
movies,removed,he said he didnt want his daughter being raped by a pack of niggers i dont think ive ever thrown that out there even during my drunkest of nights i think its safe to say the dude doesnt like black people
movies,removed,ive gotten irrationally angry and said things i didnt mean but never anything i hadnt thought before the drunkeness has removed the filter i have but being drunk has never made me say anything completely off the wall for me so maybe everyone else is different but i would never ever say something like i hope you get raped by a pack of niggers because ive never thought the word nigger and ive never hoped anyone got raped
movies,removed,telling someone i hope you get raped by a pack of niggers is a bit more than mouthing off not as bad as rape obviously but still bad
movies,removed,he just called a heckler a nigger its not like he hit someone thing was blown way out of proportion
movies,removed,somebody that say things like get raped by a pack of niggers jews are responsible for all the wars in the world and other redneck shit
movies,removed,you look like a fucking pig in heat and if you get raped by a pack of niggers it will be your fault
movies,removed,he was punished enough he was very sorry for a long time and he understands now that he cant say things like get raped by a pack of niggers jews are responsible for all the wars in the world etc without consequences
movies,removed,i think if after hed apologized for the antisemitic stuff and nothing else bad had happened he wouldnt have been out for so long maybe like a year or two but then he was caught on tape saying to his girlfriend if you get raped by a pack of niggers it will be your fault i think that kind of sealed the deal for a lot of people
movies,removed,reddddit fags ohh reddddddit fagggggs ohhhh reddddddddddit fagggggssss ohhhhhhhhhh yeahhhhhhhhh
movies,removed,you need a fucking bat beside the head
movies,removed,actually yeh they are people can change and weve all said dumb shit but cmon it was a fucking dumb and disrespectful thing to do especially on a fucking mic hes not good at standup he has issues forgive sure forget that hes a total idiot probably not
movies,removed,a man cant speak his mind these days of course the fucking jews and faggots control everything
movies,removed,mel gibson makes a kids movie or mel gibson makes a movie about kids cause one involves kids going on an adventure of some kind while calling each other spicks niggers and shitheads like in the kids movies of old and the other involves kids blowing the limbs off other kids in beautiful slowmo while calling each other cocksuckers motherfuckers and kykes which is your poison
movies,removed,mel gibson never said anything like that you fucking moron neither did the jews ban him he has steadily gotten work his issue was he kept piling on the insults from domestic abuse allegations to the infamous videotapes about niggers raping his gold digging wife granted i would hate for the shit i have said to my exes in rage be published but its not like this is something easily overlooked
movies,removed,i think he stopped making big films because he called a cop a fucking jew and told his girlfriend he hoped she got raped by a pack of niggers
movies,removed,he got blacklisted for more than just that even the article mentions the insult of gay people then he said fuck the jews and finally niggers he was asking for the blacklist
movies,removed,
movies,removed,

movies,removed,yes it does people who cannot appreciate the prequels are mentally ill and should be locked up
movies,removed,full disclosure i am a big fan of joss whedon it showed so does your irrational hatred of him offhand is exactly the way it was delivered and the reason why people have a problem with it beside the writing how can you honestly say that her delivery is in between bored and strident ringing voice because i watched the clip and made an honest judgment about whether she was speaking in a casual bored tone or not you know its funny i may be really late to the party in terms of learning pretentious psychological buzzwords but i just happened to stumble upon the term a mere one day ago and i already have a fantastic realworld example of it you seem to be acting like you see the clip with perfect objectivity whereas im a hopeless willing slave to my projoss bias it seems from your response like the possibility that we could each watch the clip and both honestly perceive it different ways simply never occurred to you the interview i referred to is year old yours is from last year obviously he became less and less of a knowitall arrogant jerk since then he matured a little so then why did you say joss can not admit everything he is doing isnt perfect present tense instead of could not past tense if his maturation is so obvious dont get mad at me because i took your statement at face value in the same interview he is bashing jeanpierre jeunet who is a billion time better than he is at directing amelie city of lost children and brought a weird unique universe to alien even though the writing sucked again none of that is objective reality its your opinion and youre perfectly entitled to it but dont act like its somehow based on indisputable fact you hate joss so you assume his explanations for what happened to the writing in alien is bullshit ive seen how good his writing is when other people arent messing with it and ive also heard a lot of horror stories from other writers getting their work butchered so his explanation seems perfectly credible to me at the end of the day theres no way to compare the quality of two directors or determine whether a piece of writing sucks in any sort of objectively verifiable way its just your opinion thats all it might even be a popular opinion but its still just an opinion
movies,removed,youre not reacting the way i want you too wahhh this is the most pretentious thing ive seen go get triggered somewhere else
movies,removed,the editing problems was from the studio wanting a hour movie and shoot me i posted a torrent for a critically pa movie that should be given another chance
movies,removed,found the leftist liberal its a fish out of water story arguing racism is just nonsense
movies,removed,how many times have you jerked off to bayonetta today
movies,removed,netflix can suck my hairy nuts big trouble in little china is and has been available via torrent since forever
movies,removed,so when dory dies i must admit i welled up a little bit it cant be explained with logic the only onion i smelled was a fart from the fat mom sitting in front me but it couldnt have happened at the exact moment dory gets swallowed by a speedboat propeller could it i also really appreciated the tender romance between marlin and dory they fuck so hard as fish regularly do and make little mixed fish caviar that will surely carry on the legacy of mental illness displayed by these two slitbreathers full review at
movies,removed,i seriously think its about time that some director revisited this no its already perfect fuck hollywood and its need to remake and reinterpret everything theyll make jack a transsexual vegan with daddy issues and lo pan will be a misunderstood oppressed ethnic minority
movies,removed,yeah understandable but theres more to freedom of speech than just using words i dont use the word nigger in casual conversation for that reason i know where it comes from and i know the connotations of using it so i dont bother i acknowledge that it is a word i could use and im glad i have the freedom to use it id just rather not and the consequences are there to remind us of what words can represent
movies,removed,vic morrow went and got his head cut off in the twighlight zone movie but that wasnt really his fault
movies,removed,thats why youre a pussy beta cuck
movies,removed,oh yeah what about in the animated cartoon when el diablo dies sacrificing himself and the joker and harley get shot down while trying to escape in a helicopter as well as enchantrace dying in the last act is what happens in ss
movies,removed,well in the animated cartoon when el diablo dies sacrificing himself and the joker and harley get shot down while trying to escape in a helicopter as well as enchantrace dying in the last act is what happens in ss
movies,removed,monica belucci maybe she needs a bit of the irreversible treatment herself
movies,removed,get your head out of radcliffe ass and try not to be too sarcastic you are not talking about daniel day lewis vs keanu reeves here we are talking about two equally good actors who still have their way to go and become great you talked about range but emma has too have mamy diverse films under her belt comedy drama thriller even a musical she will lead a film with tom hanks she is just as succesfull as he is the only thing dan has that shs has not is theatre but not every film actor needs to do theater you know again get your head out his ass
movies,removed,

movies,removed,thats wat we call sword of death guy lets take time to watch nice nigerian movie
movies,removed,what do you think it had the same budget as independence day insurgence its a niche film only showing in a handful of theaters that can basically only run ads on fox news since the liberal media proven that hillary owns through the dnc email leaks would never advertise it
movies,removed,are you fucking stupid neckbeard refers to a lifestyle not an actual beard although there is obvious overlap
movies,removed,torrent honestly
movies,removed,yes anybody who makes money off a legit business is a criminal to a liberal hillary not only is a proven corrupt lying negligent criminal but she is also a rapeenabling classified info leaking flipflopping lying cunt who let an american ambassador die a bloody death in the streets of libya but hey trump said mean words so do what you gotta do
movies,removed,oh shit playing the victim card again the democratic party would collapse if not for the victim card who are you fooling your numbers are dwindling homie are numbers are winning every major poll sweetheart one man not affiliated with blm killed some cops hahahahaha wow he literally was affiliated with black lives matter that racist terror group that chants what do we want dead cops when do we want them now in the streets youre delusional i agree with the president this is before i block you because im a grownup with a job and youre probably years ago ferguson was started because a exconvict attacked an officer in his cruiser tried to steal his gun then never ever said hands up dont shoot he was justifiably killed with no evidence the president declared this racial bias and condemned police when his dumbass rhetoric catches on and somebody assassinates cops over it after being assured the police are against blacks suddenly we dont know the motive anybody who isnt a complete and total retard knows the motive fund the police its so much more entertaining coming on reddit and slapping around folks like you women typically slap instead of punch
movies,removed,oh no im sorry i agree with you i thought you were a liberal being sarcastic to me
movies,removed,reddit has a significant number of gen x and gen y they tend not to be conservative thats actually a good point people tend to become conservative later in life as they get wiser and have actually worked and experienced the real world bernie had a huge number of young people following him should have been a red flag from the beginning if dumb emotional college kids love your angle probably need to rethink it
movies,removed,were not going to agree that trump is worse and can go back and forth all day so im going to skip those responses and chalk it up to agree to disagree it was and is racist its not at all racist aside from mexican not being a race he doesnt want them out because they are mexican he wants them out because they are illegal and hes giving them a chance to return legally open borders is a disastrous policy ask germany if it were million illegal swedish he would want them out too lets keep out the whites since they seem to kill minorities except white is not a dangerous violent ideology that commits largescale terror attacks you know this youre trolling me to say yeah but a white guy did something too is just sticking your head in the sand in the name of tolerance so fuck em all then unfortunately yes i dont know what to tell you if you say to me we have million syrian refugees and we have no possible way to tell who is radical and who is not i cant let them in its insanity pure fucking insanity why cant dubai take them in or qatar or other muslim rich nations why do we have to ruin our country what about advocating for a database of all people who follow a religion as long as you dont hurt any of them fine by me again its national security not bigotry does not mean theyre deserving of death and again hes saying that to scare the potential terrorists nobody can conceivably think he really wants to round up families and execute them and i could kill people and say im doing this for usocialjusticeisaids but that doesnt mean you condone what im doing thats still why they are doing it and if there were several frequent largescale terror attacks done in my name i would hope people who investigate and criticize the ideology that caused it
movies,removed,dont listen to this this baby has had his brainwashed by the libbo media its a shame theyre probably a good person thats just headed in the wrong direction individualism is the only way redistribution and government controlled markets are the fast track to the hell zone
movies,removed,jinroh its funny how you can see the reddit bump happening on the torrent sites i just looked up jin roh on pirate bay and it has more leechers than seeders right now
movies,removed,sup my niggas
movies,removed,at the end of the movie humangodzilla hybrids begin to appear out of the tail
movies,removed,if you pm me i can send a link to the torrent i suppose i meant i give people a copy of the file i found on a drive in person typically
movies,removed,i would love to see it in theatre but its not going to be shown in my country so i hope someone puts it on torrent sites or i will have to wait to buy it on dvd
movies,removed,probably believees feminists should be at the very least stopped before they start putting forward ideas barring that executed before they can influence others
movies,removed,its a pretty good doc tldr stings wife starts off making a documentary about the movie and stings involvement in creating the soundtrack stings music gets mostly scrapped along with a lot of the animation work and he gets mad and the doc turns into a chronicle of the roller coaster that ended up producing the emperors new groove
movies,removed,so these threats are a fuckin joke i got one once almost a year ago because i accidentally left a torrent of the most recent season of the simpsons running for a couple days im pretty fearless now ive been downloading terabytes of shit since then and havent gotten any more notices
movies,removed,who is your daddy and what does he do

movies,removed,hey guysso basically i did a video on the movie suicide squad and my problem with this movieso what do you guys think about the i am also new to reddit
movies,removed,a most impressive ama
movies,removed,i actually used to think he had little to no acting range until recently thanks for making some retarded assumptions though
movies,removed,lol you literally mocked someone in this very thread for liking skyfall and rating it over mission impossible you hypocritical cunt
movies,removed,youre wrong the movie is garbage get over it
movies,removed,i only call people cunts when theyre acting like it also calling someone is easily just as pathetic and just being a condescending ass who repeatedly talks down to people who like movies that he didnt is way worse
movies,removed,how long before i could realistically watch shingoji in america via torrent or other methods
movies,removed,stop being facetious fag
movies,removed,you forgot that were all on the autism spectrum these days also gluten intolerance
movies,removed,turns out that when you splurge on a huge marketing budget and then tell half the people watching said marketing that they shouldnt go see it because they have the original sin of misogyny on them it doesnt sell tickets
movies,removed,its easy first you go go to bit torrent and download the movie then you watch it when youre done you can delete it oh and dont forget to give yourself some money
movies,removed,shouldnt have had an all woman cast
movies,removed,one of the nigga its the
movies,removed,a fuckdoll would be a better choice than rihanna
movies,removed,i will bathe in your female tears bitch im loving the fact that feminists defended this piece of garbage simply because it was an allfemale cast not that it was a good movie that was unfairly criticized admit it
movies,removed,that guy is a closet fag
movies,removed,i agree the film isnt last airbender dogshit but it is so obviously a money grab with a whole bunch of people who couldnt care less about the source material without the npr hilary audience getting stirred up and bringing their cuck
movies,removed,another victory for the patriarchy l o m a l m a a m o a m l m a o m a a m l m a o l
movies,removed,no because paul feig is a closet fag
movies,removed,harambes first movie may be her last aww haaail naw
movies,removed,how the fuck do you know you cock sucker ive seen enough to know they are exactly like the fucking comic book at least nolan had some creativity and gave us a different interpretation dont get mad at me because your brain is fucking stupid and likes having their movies spelled out for you in the trailer sorry for having an imagination that goes beyond a fucking comic book story you faggot cocksucker fedora wearing bitch
movies,removed,im fucking arguing with a bitch who likes comic book movies lol christ reddit is full of pussies and beta males youre fucking soft bro
movies,removed,thats reaching pretty far to fit your narrative fact is the movie was terrible and trying to make it a gender issue is creating a problem when one never existed but i guess you can try to get social justice to feel better about your shitty world view
movies,removed,i could have sworn one of the kids that attack booster after he gets punched by myron yells we dont like you fag
movies,removed,same i wanted to see koko the gorillas acting debut
movies,removed,theyre still doing animated spinoffs are we gonna have to teach those cucks another lesson
movies,removed,this will be a movie i torrent and probably wont buy
movies,removed,youre a special kind of idiot
movies,removed,oh godwhat a fucking waste of flesh wow
movies,removed,i wont even torrent this
movies,removed,nuhuhhibbidyjibbidy bajang dang dong sheeeeeeiiiiiiiit
movies,removed,because communism seriously you cant have creativity when you actively punish creativity theres a reason a country of billion contributes next to nothing to the world culturally most of their contributions came prior to
movies,removed,you get your furrykin panties in a wad did you get triggered because your ideas are stupid and got called out on it go fuck your gender fluid dildo and keep your mouth shutpeople without mental disorders are talking
movies,removed,this nigga out here eatin chasing that bread instead of these hoes for real
movies,removed,this is what turned me off to the movie the fact that the black
movies,removed,grown ups talking stfu no one cares about what you say or want to believe to feel better about yourself fucktard
movies,removed,eat nigger shit cock fuck
movies,removed,ah i think youre also a fucking idiot but your neice says otherwise right
movies,removed,cry cry bitch bitch just stfu already no one cares or bothers to listen this is why no one likes you are youre miserable get a clue retard
movies,removed,get your mental illness checked out they have pills for people like you now otherkin shitstain
movies,removed,its actually very enjoyable to call idiots out for being stupid and if you subscribe to the retarded notion of gender fluidgo fuck yourself with a firehose as wellretard
movies,removed,i dont even want to torrent that movie it seems to be a parody of ghostbusters
movies,removed,uh uuh no you dint
movies,removed,suck my cock faggot
movies,removed,usmallpoxchamp is a coward
movies,removed,ghostbusters was such a dope movie though i wish it had done better on an unrelated note harrypotterfanaticscom is offering free deathly hallow keychains all you pay is shipping seems like a good deal figure i would tell the reddit fam before it ran out httpsharrypotterfanaticscomproductsdeathlyhallowkeychain
movies,removed,i had an impression that they largely didnt change the plot besides getting rid of guys and putting in women at which point i would only watch it on tv one lazy weekend and at which point i would probably prioritise the originals because they are better of the time i would have watched it if reviews and buzz came back good maybe but generally i dont like watching big budget films in theatres usually i save that for the artsyfartsy films that are hard to torrent
movies,removed,have fun being a cuck
movies,removed,lol what a bunch of clowns all of you people crack me up with your retarded ideas
movies,removed,coward and a moron who sends retarded messages to people who clearly couldnt care less about their opinion
movies,removed,good fuckin dykes
movies,removed,now if you can figure out what gender you feel like being perhaps you can don the furry suits and prance around like retards dont reproduce people like you is why the world is getting stupider everyday
movies,removed,i never said women arent interested i stem you typical feminist idiot they arent as interested in it as men are do you fucking understand that you feminists are so brain dead its incredible there are far more men in science than there are women get over it femicunt
movies,removed,again either youre misinformed or lying to push a narrative leslie jones started by attacking milo for his review of the film and calling him a derogatory word for homosexual that starts with an f and ends with a g so she got what she asked for
movies,removed,nope they attacked people one of the actresses even called a gay movie critic a fot on twitter
movies,removed,its a general metric to compare the relative popular consensus about a given movie dipshit
movies,removed,your opinion on milo or me doesnt change the facts of the case which are exactly as i laid out youre lying and got caught doing it
movies,removed,id have no problem with a woman president but not this president at what point will you guys stop saying yeah this lady isnt good enough either
movies,removed,lets be real most girl shit sucks
movies,removed,hot action movies new adventure movies action movies english hollywood new movies
movies,removed,im concerned will they put harimbe down after this news or relocate her to a new zoo
movies,removed,ok then you cuck sjw piece of shit lets hear your arguments as to why ghostbusters is better than warcraft
movies,removed,so why havent they gotten rid of the guy who suggested that hillary clinton be assassinated this guy httpstwittercomrealdonaldtrump
movies,removed,id have given them my international money only if they werent being such assholes also if the movie didnt suck not even gonna torrent it
movies,removed,ive only seen the trailer but shes sidebyside with scientists with phds you really think her knowledge of new york buildings is significantly more than street smarts iirc the trailer had her incessantly asking about all this science mumbo jumbo there is no saving her character i feel like whoever wrote in her character has only ever encountered black people on tv she was by far the worst character her character is the modern day equivalent of the slapstick crosseyed guy who keeps running into closed doors bam something sciencey happens camera pans to fat black lady saying shieeeeeeeeeeeet
movies,removed,muhfuggah bixnood
movies,removed,t cuck
movies,removed,personally im glad the majority of people decided to take a stand against this movie not because it has women in it not even because its a bad movie but because sony and paul feige and amy pascal and melissa mccarthy

movies,removed,we kinda gave up i mean honestly thats a good call the idea that my kid should be shielded from a few swear words or some boobs is ridiculous i hate the way we have prioritized whats cool for kids to seehear what little jonny wants to play gta where he robs and assaults hookers well i guess so id hate to say no and have him be the only one out of his friends that cant play it later when little jonny gets caught watching some porn what what what honey we need net nanny immediately how in the fuck with my kids ive always been pretty loose with anything besides violence of course i dont allow my kids to swear though because something about hearing a year old say go fuck your mother you faggot dick anus makes me want to punch kittens

movies,removed,my favourite bio is the prick
movies,removed,its possible but his website is still up my friend grabbed it right after he released the version and he received no nasty emails

movies,removed,is there a sign in front of my garage that says dead nigger storage
movies,removed,are you that moronic he wasnt a useless dinosaur that part only occurred once bond got back from months of drinking a shitty injury once he puts himself back in the field he regains hus abilties hence why he took out silvas men so flawlessly on the island or how he took out blofelds mwn after the drill scene the old had returned and again are you reading anything i say are supposed to have a short life expectancy years of field work and injuries will result in a fast aging and skyfall was acclaimed qos was not it is objectively a good film if you think the travesty that was qos was better you need your head examined
movies,removed,im going to find you
movies,removed,the big black lebowski reviews nine lives they call him the dude but i hope bbl sticks lol he literally smokes weed because of that movie haha
movies,removed,ahhh go suck youre mothers dick
movies,removed,this was part of one of my favorite moviegoing experiences ever i saw it opening night and the theater goes silent as he picks it up right in front of me some black dude goes ohhhh shit dat niggas worthy and the whole theater starts dying

movies,removed,are you lonely visit private room no scam no card free httpadultsexchatml
movies,removed,wtf are you talking about shes right here with me with cookies and milk in hand youre a faggot and no amount of buttsex will ever birth you and your faggot lover a child
movies,removed,this doesnt pass the brandberg test saying hitler did nothing wrong in no way passes the brandenburg test httpsenmwikipediaorgwikibrandenburgvohio saying hit me you kike would pass this test because it incites violence by literally inviting it tip just because violence resulted as a product of the speech does not mean that the speech incited the violence otherwise i could just assault anyone who said anything and claim it was simply inciting speech and get off scott free nothing said to shia in this case was illegal shias assault however was
movies,removed,stabasocialist if you see a radical leftist talking stab them in their throat
movies,removed,heres the problem though saying hitler did nothing wrong wasnt funny the first time and we live in a reality with pol saying we should literally gas the kikes it turns out that what you say has consequences
movies,removed,show me what someone would be charged with saying nigger wont get me arrested ive never said it irl fwiw but if i use hate speech in a way to discriminate such as for a job etc then yes that is a crime that is my understanding for the us anyways
movies,removed,good make social justice warriors afraid again
movies,removed,its practically the same as if shia was black and some internet shitposter came up to him the same way and said hey shia youre a nigger i feel like if it happened that way a lot more people would be on shias side now i dont have all the details of this event and i dont know all the times he got a little physical or belligerent with people but i can empathize with him when it comes to times like these where the person is clearly trying to provoke him or mock the movement or whatever at a certain point you have to stop looking at it so left brained and lawfully and you have to see that this is a mostly human reaction i feel like if almost any person was provoked this way theyd at least respond with a shove like shia did honestly i think it wouldve been worse in certain situations
movies,removed,and soviet russia was not a communist state muh not real go be a tankie somewhere else you cuck
movies,removed,not disregarding what you said but if you went up to a black guy and said cotton picking nigger people wouldnt blame the black guy for decking you isnt this on the same level
movies,removed,is the whole faggot thing on homophobic in your view
movies,removed,nice haha fuck that muslim bitch
movies,removed,i dont think trump supporters can understand that though all sand niggers are the same and should never dare to talk according to them
movies,removed,fite me irl faget
movies,removed,how about not being a faggot
movies,removed,faggot
movies,removed,where did i assault someone where did i endorse assaulting someone i guess i just hurt your feelings by associating you with the nazis you were trying to defend in your little wolfinpussycatsclothing covert oh gee mister are you sure he was really a nazi all i saw was some faggot in a scarf while pushing your floppy little mantits together sucking in your gut pouting out those wormy little lips and flashing those big cow eyes you may fool some people but i see what youre doing
movies,removed,and still no argument to be seen thanks for proving what a fucking idiot you are haha
movies,removed,wow you are actually one of the stupidest persons i have ever talked to online and that is saying a lot this isnt systematic or the government punching these pieces of shit this is a person punching another person for spewing hate speech and being a piece of shit so if these guys keep talking about some race bullshit its all good cuz its all talk and then eventually they get more power but its still all talk so its all good right then they start killing people oh shit i wonder how we could have prevented this 🤔🤔🤔 quick question if some white dude goes up to a random black dude and calls him a nigger and calls him subhuman and tells him his race should be destroyed but doesnt lay a finger on him would you say the black guy is a nazi piece of shit for punching the white dude in his face and not allowing him to freely share his valid political opinion seriously i want to hear your opinion on this
movies,removed,seriouslyat least see if once or twice in theatres before you torrent the movies arent that expensive
movies,removed,
movies,removed,not a film but try the series black mirror i found most of the stories to be more unsettling and horrific than most horror films i mean that in a genuine way intelligent well produced and acted stories that really get under your skin and linger in the mind for days if not weeksmonths
movies,removed,trump in his inauguration speech
movies,removed,promoting the ideology of nazis is not just saying mean things if i said to the president im going to assasinate you or i post that i am going to carry out a terroist attack i would get in serious trouble for saying mean things if someone calls a black dude a nigger are you going to defend him when he gets punched in the face you can say those things under the protection of the first amendment that amendment however will not protect you from repercussions
movies,removed,your retarded

movies,removed,it doesnt makes sense to me that the alien ship didnt just crashland like the ones from independence day when the queen was defeated i guess if it did the world would still have been destroyed since having a massive alien ship instead of the atlantic ocean would cripple the ecosystem and the writers cant have that
movies,removed,hmm well i torrent everything so i think its worth it
movies,removed,tell him httpsgcokgsiqldjv
movies,removed,torrentz
movies,removed,you dont own anything you buy online thats tied to a cloud service just ask xbox kinesthetic fitness owners theres two ways to own this you either torrent it or you buy the bluray or dvd otherwise youre just paying for one licensing model or another to stream it as long as a company lets you people delude themselves that buying content on amazon google play or itunes is somehow different than streaming off netflix the only difference is that you paid a fuck ton more and theyll have it up much longer but the promise for you to access it indefinitely is the same you have no say if they take it down none if you buy movies tied to a storage locker youre a sucker
movies,removed,so youll pay bucks to stream something bc youre too lazy to pop a disc in a bluray player layer also you realize you can stream torrents for free right quit rewarding companies taking our ownership rights
movies,removed,except torrents
movies,removed,really motherfucker get off your high horse and out your moms basement movie was shit get over it fuck him and fuck you too 😂
movies,removed,swiss army man i went in expecting a fart movie which i got but the film is so much deeper than that it truly is beautifully filmed perfectly paced and just cliché enough to be endearing its one of the few movies ive seen in the past few years that i am legitimately tempted to go see again
movies,removed,batman v superman extended edition i liked it a lot more than i thought i would i skipped the theater version because the critics hated it and now im curious about why what was added to this release the only weak spot was lex luther the actor was trying to be the joker or something
movies,removed,green room totally worth watching the sum of its parts make for an engrossing somewhat original movie in that it follows a traditional plot vaguely reminiscent of rural horror like frontiers but also does its own thing
movies,removed,bfg
movies,removed,just finished watching green room and i doubt it will be topped hardgritty and death scenes very reminiscent of the clumsiness which made blue ruin so special ps rip anton yelchin
movies,removed,swiss army man my absolute favorite movie of the year for a movie about a farting corpse it had more heart than ive seen in most movies in the last couple of years
movies,removed,the fundamentals of caring much better than i was expecting the cast were great with some nice humour thanks to paul rudd comedy and craig roberts sarcasm it has heart and a great road trip to the deepest pit in the world what more could you want
movies,removed,your mother was tight on my dick last night faggot
movies,removed,ill use whatever words i want you trick ass hoe
movies,removed,do you need to masturbate to release the tension should i call you up and pretend to be your mother again so you tip over the edge for once
movies,removed,thats a shame i havent seen it so ill wait until i can torrent it then what made it bad i was excited following dofp
movies,removed,batman v supermen ultimate extended i never saw the theatrical version but this one is really good not perfect a few loose ends but good snyder knows how to frame the move like a comic book the dark tones are really different from the marvel movies and that might frustrate some peoples expectations but if you are not expecting a marvel movie its really good i didnt feel any unecessary scenes in this edition it really was good
movies,removed,you arent normal
movies,removed,you are obviously a bad person blocked
movies,removed,okay bipolar guy the online opinions of a self confessed unstable person dont mean shit to me
movies,removed,hello everyone i recently i watch movie he paramedic lady going full terminator with the shotgun was one of the most satisfying sequences ive seen in a while also really liked the idea of volunteer armored ambulances and body collection units running counter to the murder gangs

movies,removed,are you retarded or just intentionally ignoring the vast amount of flaws in that shit movie she escapes all by herself no help needed at all she some how mind tricks her way out of imprisonment in like seconds then she some how sneaks though the entire star base perfectly then she wins a duel against a guy she has no right lasting half a second against see back to when she was caught then she easily escapes the exploding base the closest thing to help she got was the fact that the falcon was near her so she could fly that instead of hijacking a tie fighter or some shit

movies,removed,whatthefuck reviewing the movie isnt about your views on the director or the stars its about the movie by all means dont support an actor or a directors work if you think hes piece of shit but sont try to pass off your beliefs about the person as a review of his onscreen work its crazy i even have to explain this shit to you are you
movies,removed,httpgbgbsroro
movies,removed,there is one sequence with her in a car trying to escape that is intense but then there are moments where she stops in the most dangerous places where you are screaming bitch run even a white person next to me saidonly white people and this was at a screening with fede alverez the director in attendance more of my thoughts in my review httpwwwrendyreviewscomblogdontbreathereview

movies,removed,we gotta have that search engine optimization shit nigga
movies,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

movies,removed,from what i have read and from the reviews it is basically a christian movie in disguise the trailer is intentionally misleading apparently they have a complete lack of understanding on the entire concept of evolution by means of natural selection and then at some point in the movie they shove a giant heaping of jesus bullshit down your throat this is not my opinion just what is being written about the movie

movies,removed,age unlike you im not a geriatric i have better things to do with my time than watch hours films per week average american oooh great benchmark striving for average complacency the average human is also fat and dumb do you use that as an excuse for yourself too
movies,removed,hey op some moron in this thread told me that you should watch hours of film per week my recommendation is to not do that you dont want to get burnt out and overwhelmed you also want to keep spare time for other activities also like youd waste your life away watching movies all week
movies,removed,if i said based on your posts that you are probably a hateful young white male living in europe and you probably jack off times a day between yelling at your mom for chicken tendies due to your autism thats a stereotype i am sure that is not true but it is a stereotype

movies,removed,cg yoda was in keeping with the polished look of the prequels and indeed broke ground for later cg characters such as gollum and caesar the cg yoda was very poorly received and one only sets a standard by doing it right looking at what lucas has done with the original trilogy shows he doesnt know what to do with cgi theres always crap in front of the characters hes not using it tastefully hes flaunting it which is why you see parodies like you can hear this straight from lucas where hes quoted as trying to have tons of stuff going on in the shot i completely understand tfa was more of the same from the original trilogy but i cant justify the new trilogy being absolutely terrible because they were pushing new ground they were just poorly made in every possible way including the cgi

movies,removed,you have no idea what youre talking about what youre saying goes against basic research just because people have been perverted by cultural conditioning doesnt mean their reaction is healthy or normal and dont try to evade by yapping about what normal or healthy really is im guessing youre a heterosexual male which means discussing human sexuality with you is like trying to teach a dog about quantum physics first off theres no such thing as heterosexual and homosexual since those words were made up by gay researchers to create a neutral label to replace normal people vs faggots people were supposed to murder its a false dichotomy but it was better than what they had before that beneath that for most of human civilization everyone was basically gender fluid but existed within a patriarchy so there was stigma to taking it up the ass but not giving it all males experience homosexual urges and how they deal with them is what creates the homophobia you are not genetically heterosexualthats not a thing and will never be a thing and your tone is ridiculous just because youve been perverted by cultural conditioning that makes you experience screwed up emotional reactions when you see homosexual acts doesnt mean its natural its similar to how people thought being repulsed by black people is a natural thing this is a bit more intimate than skin colour but same misconception arises healthy heterosexual men are not disgusted by gay sex because they just have no attraction to it just like gay people who dont mind or dont care about it if they do see it theres no eeew gross infantile response

movies,removed,your previous statement already showed your nature youre full of bullshit
movies,removed,if its got a dick we can kill it
movies,removed,i went and saw it at the cinema i really like the four lead actresses from their previous work and they got a lot of laughs out of me the movie itself as a ghostbusters film or as just a standalone film was a steaming piece of shit and i wish id been able to convince my girlfriend to wait for a torrent and not waste our money
movies,removed,good now go die in a fire douchebag
movies,removed,sorry to hear you have poor taste thats not an insult youre saying a facet of my character is less than desirable thats like pretty much the textbook definition of an insult your logic makes you look like a wave sjw feminist here youre just saying youre probably part of a group that i dont like very much which isnt an insult unless i suppose its a group i also dont like very much then i might find it insulting youre not terribly good at this are you maybe youre retarded i dunno sorry if thats the case really i dont wanna bully some autistic kid into suicide but in case youre not a retard lets talk about my logic i say a movie made me laugh my taste gets insulted i insult the insulter in return wheres the fault in the logic its not like i said insulting people is bad and never to be done i was taken aback at being insulted for saying something so benign and returned it in kind and you know now that ive written it out i feel bad you must be retarded
movies,removed,how about i just downvote you for being a retard and believing what you wrote is true
movies,removed,i think its already bad my gf isnt ganna watch it because all her coworkers have bad mouthed it that combined with all the crap i read here makes me not want to spend the money either torrents it is
movies,removed,i would love to see leslie jones hosed down in the streets for what she did to the ghostbusters franchise i still wouldnt pay to see anything with her in it though
movies,removed,you didnt like it millions did id watch it a hundred times before sitting through another bland judd apatow pos and none of you own ghostbusters the people who do made this movie and made bank cause its a solid comedy not every movie has to be for the comfort and calming of butthurt basement dwelling neck beards ebonics just realized you said this sw is sigourney weaver and youre a racist piece of shit
movies,removed,actually to me it stops people from voting twice and even if the incidence is exceptionally rare i think its a worthy goal this is why we have voter registration and even before we had that we had inkmarking which honestly worked even better and would still work better than showing an id so how exactly does showing id help with this alreadysolved problem do you even understand the problem as to your last bit the problem with the majority of people like you that support the equivalent of a poll tax is that they always say things like i want people to work to vote and i dont want it to be too easy but then it turns out what they really mean is i dont want them niggers voting for the wrong person and thisll stop some of em like get some historical perspective theres a reason stuff like this is illegal and the supreme court just overturned a state trying to implement state id showing when comissioned papers were put into evidence that was revealed the team pushing it had disenfranchising black democrats as their primary goal not in fact the prevention of double voting so this isnt even ancient history this happened last fucking week
movies,removed,i love how you edited that part out and miss out the obvious fact the mod deleted for personal reasons and that they had no issues posting controversial opinions that were positive about the film
movies,removed,i think youre a beta thats what
movies,removed,this was the best movie i watch dis week tittle deep sexual sin
movies,removed,agreed nothing about the movie offended me in any way yeah the acting was shallow and soulless but it didnt outright ruin the experience one of those movies that i watched and said meh would likely never go back and watch it again but if they released another i would torrent that bad boy

movies,removed,i find it hilarious when meninists portray this movie as feminist propaganda its hilarious how sensitive and paranoid you are and lol taking a movie so seriously its just a movie you sad greasy little nolife nerd virgins im a cruz supporter and am as conservative as anyone but you meninists are an embarrassment to the male gender see of us are able to have normal relationships with women and then there are you deviants while we were getting laid in high school you meninists were the little greasy fatfuck or scrawny nerds ridiculed by girls who ended up crying at home jerking off to pictures of old emma watson while were were getting laid in college you meninists were the little greasy fatfuck or scrawny nerd virgins ridiculed by coeds who ended up crying in your dorm rooms and jerking off to pictures of old emma watson on your computers while were dating and getting married as adults you meninists are the bitter barelyemployable little greasy fatfuck obese hogs or scrawny pansies with menial loser jobs whove built up a lifetime of resentment against women and spew your nerd rage on anonymous internet forums like chickenshits because you have no friends and no one to talk to oh and of course you still jerk off to pics of old emma watson that or you got raped by daddy and mommy didnt do anythingcare dawwwww and now you hate women for life that or youre closet gays who hate women so much youve totally swung the other way or actually more like you were always that way you cry about women to hide the fact you secretly take it up the ass whatever the case youre geneticallydefective aberrations whose genes havent been selected by evolution to be passed on since youre physically repugnant to women youre not going to help the species propagate and if you offer zero reproductive value and arent going to help the species propagate youre wastes of resources and should be hunted down and exterminated the nazis would have shoved you geneticallyinferior freaks into ovens meninists the of men unable to have normal relationships with women the physicallydeformed the sociallyinept the fugly obese or scrawny virgins the freaks and losers the deviants im almost finished modding my and youre such an embarrassment to my gender if it was legal id consider it a service to humanity testing it out on you useless resourcewasting parasites
movies,removed,my argument is theyre saying every movie deserves a shot and i agree but the instant regret of going to a movie knowing you might end up hating it and paying for a movie ticket doesnt make movies like this remake worth trying ill watch it when it comes out or more realistically ill torrent it

movies,removed,i try not to expect too much which is why i dont really watch trailers to anything except huge blockbusters these days i just want the thing im watching to be whatever it wants to be i dont read about plot either all of that stuff is counter productive because it never will make you enjoy the story being told more that said i did hear quite a few good things about the witch so couldnt avoid expecting something solid in that case and it delivered but damn if i wasnt surprised when i realized it was a period piece
movies,removed,no i said take his dick out of your mouth not gargle and swallow silly fag

movies,removed,the central park five
movies,removed,torrentits for charity id like to see anyone try to punish you for it
movies,removed,hate to be the wet blanket here not really but this film although admittedly better done with the addition of chris pine as a colead yes they are finally getting it will not do very well it wont do what catwoman and elektra did as they were completely abysmal but it will fail heres the thing and theres no really getting beyond this women arent interesting im sorry nobody cares about female driven movies even females as big a movement as the feminist movement is including the cuck males that infest it even they arent enough to support female driven moviesunless the budgets are less than million women super heros its laughable i love gal gadot but id rather see her naked as the next bond girl than to be the lead of a movie why do you think the studio put chris pine in there i realize he will purposely be second billed but dont doubt it for a second he is a colead they knew they had to have a male lead or everything would be lost so while this film will be better than its predecessors it will still lose money
movies,removed,aww did i hurt some of yalls wittle feelings lol at the downvotes for criticizing a shit scene in a shit film god some of you are megafaggots

movies,removed,my old is dying to see this we read the novel times so far cover to cover and is very sad this isnt playing anywhere local and that daddy cant find any working torrents does reddit enjoy sad children
movies,removed,wow just wow came to a bfg thread to be a cunt life internet goals achieved
movies,removed,me and my friends had a field day big fuckin guy big fuckin gay bills favorite garnish bolivias faggot genocide were not well

movies,removed,
movies,removed,maybe you are the south park variety of fag just saying
movies,removed,im sure some of them are if either of you have amazon prime you could check on there too or always torrent from sites like putlocker if you are up for that sort of thing
movies,removed,well if it upsets you maybe you could stop sucking dick
movies,removed,now do one about the real curent terrorists radical islamists i dare you i double dare you cucked hollywood
movies,removed,are you a jew motherfucker
movies,removed,well stop being a fgt then
movies,removed,do you think well ever see a movie or tv show humanize nazis i know everyone hates nazis but at this point ive come to expect it from every nazi movie and its getting boring
movies,removed,idk about a movie but holy crap the lastest season of game of thrones was a mess simply because the writing was soooooooooo bad one easy example for reference would be the arya chase scene where she is stabbed times in the gut fell into dirty water bleeding out and still beat a trained faceless man by luring them into the dark
movies,removed,for the emperor
movies,removed,gyllenhaal was genuinely offputting as the autist photographer in nightcrawler
movies,removed,not really worried about the neo nazis as much as radical muslims who actually destroy shit and people hollywood would never make that movie
movies,removed,i cant help but wonder if antiracist films are like antiwar films theres no such thing american history x probably did a great deal of recruiting for the fascist right having harry potter with a shaven skull could give more images for those types to recruit on not like anyone actually paid attention to the moral of american history x just muscles on nortan and a curb stomping
movies,removed,just think how big outrage there would be if hollywood released a muslim terror plot movie yet this is fine
movies,removed,interesting to see this post together with the the sikh community celebrates of july post hm
movies,removed,we must have a huge neo nazi problem with their mass murders across the us san bernadino ft hood orlando
movies,removed,he was one guy with mental issues not a suicide bomber part of a plan of neonazis that will blow up the parliment or something
movies,removed,with the attacks on trump supporters and the shit storm that is creating i think it could have a very poignant and meaningful message im not completely sure of what message youre posting here it almost reads as though youre implying the trump supporters are the victims and the neonazis in this movie are representative of the people who attack them unprovoked excuse me if im wrong in that interpretation if thats what youre saying you might be surprised to learn that trump is the favorite candidate of actual neonazis white supremacists and white nationalists httpswwwbuzzfeedcomandrewkaczynskimeettheprominentwhitenationalistsfireduptosupportdo
movies,removed,liberal delusions the movie
movies,removed,sociopath and psychopath dont exist anymore medically speaking theyre combined under the umbrella of antisocial personality disorder
movies,removed,considering the fact that the kkk and all the nazi groups in america are all already just a bunch of fbi agents it would be a nice plot twist at the end that it was all just a test to see if he was good enough for the secret service
movies,removed,bbbuh anti raysism is anti wite
movies,removed,is everyone who is white and loves their peoplecountry a nazi to you if you want to see real national socialism look at israel
movies,removed,its disturbing that they make movies about neo nazis being bad when i dont even the last time they did anything bad other than express their opinions in the trailer they even refer to them as lesser than humans
movies,removed,i fucking hate nazis but more so i really dislike hollywood for exploiting nazis and skinheads and giving this shit visibility we used to fight skins back in the when the first wave of nazi skins came out mostly they were just other punks but they were always out looking for fights and to be really annoying the funny thing is that of all the skins i used to know not one of them is still racist and none of them are very proud of themselves hollywood is really really jewish so of course they make movies where the bad guys are all nazis and shit but the downside is that by making the whole skinhead image seem kind of provocative you wind up with idiots actually taking this crap seriously
movies,removed,whiteguilt
movies,removed,there are probably more actors portraying neonazis in this movie than there are real neonazis but ok sure never mind the real terrorists actually killing scores of people
movies,removed,guess this is supposed to make us forget muslims are beheading people on a daily basis and hate america
movies,removed,you didnt look far enough apparently this movie is the epitome of white guilt despite the protagonist being white and the person who hires him to stop the nazis being white also people seem to have forgotten that it was primarily white people who fought the nazis years ago but this is the yt comments i dont think we should expect much logic to be found there
movies,removed,this looks exciting and all but ill bet the actual movie will be some of the most blatant and heavyhanded jidf propaganda youve ever seen if the opening credits are dedicated to the million im walking out and getting a refund
movies,removed,yes more white blaming poor innocent muslims being attacked by savage white men who dont understand their islamic culture
movies,removed,the year of white guilt and self hate
movies,removed,awesome more race related propaganda perpetuated by the main stream media
movies,removed,well hollywood has to keep reminding everyone that its the white man thats the true evil in this world
movies,removed,so a movie about bad white people when we need more movie about fucking muslim monsters to educate the public what the ever loving fuck where is the movie about the hate group black lives matter fuck these liberal hollywood pussies
movies,removed,get over yourself you tool
movies,removed,god emperor
movies,removed,brave hollywood taking on the popular and dangerous neonazi movement
movies,removed,woohoo evil nazi bastards can someone remind me how many bombings did they do in the last years
movies,removed,ahhh yup the mythical neonazi boogeyman just in time for election season thanks hollywood
movies,removed,thats because the regressive left is gaining power in the country even the president supports them once one radical group gains power other groups have to become radical just for their ideology to be heard
movies,removed,digging up nazis to distract the gullible from the real danger the movie part
movies,removed,more jew run hollywood demonization of western nationalism preserving european heritage is a beautiful thing
movies,removed,fuck muslims breathing the same air as me makes me angry this is just expected fucking liberal brain washing when ever was there a bombing in the us done by the aryans muslims kill people all the god damn time and libtards still think the white man is the problem fuck this harry potter ass hole for promoting the this nonsense
movies,removed,absolutely pathetic they arent even trying to hide it anymore propaganda stupid people will fall for
movies,removed,this looks horrible
movies,removed,because he has a set history of them and is an honest connection to the kkk with hillary that didnt stop him from calling people white niggers and still be about gay rights
movies,removed,the autism spectrum is wide thats why its called a spectrum there are highfunctioning people on the spectrum who can manipulate and deceive with the best of them
movies,removed,no no dont you get it its ok to fuck with white people now because something something privilege and these losers prove that its all about revenge disdain and revenge to them
movies,removed,seems like a very fitting movie in a year that experienced the rise of trump
movies,removed,funny swap the skin colors and it basically becomes a movie about radical islam
movies,removed,so while radical muslims are shootingblowing up innocent people all over the world hollywood decides to make a movie about those evil white people shame
movies,removed,they dont dare to say it and i bet theres good muslims in it to prove not all muslims are radical
movies,removed,just more jewish holocaust propaganda
movies,removed,reminds me of bernie sanders for some reason
movies,removed,white supremacists make a bomb and are scary people but muslims blow shit up and are peaceful and black lives matter but they kill record numbers in black on back violence every single week when do we get a movie about muslims and how they behead and kill or about the blacks who kill each other in gang wars or the mexican cartels that use chainsaws to cut peoples heads off but nope another hate on whites movie about how bad whites are and dont forget to call them nazis that makes them double bad
movies,removed,and the nigger stoning
movies,removed,the constant churning out of whiteguilt type movies yes neonazis are evil people but are they seriously such a big problem that there needs to be a new film every year or so about them where then are the movies about islamist extremists black lives matter
movies,removed,i honestly cant remember the last tom hanks movie that i didnt like is he even capable of making a subpar movie at this point
movies,removed,i didnt think they would finish the monsters inc trilogy so soon
movies,removed,spoilers the plane lands in the river and nobody dies

movies,removed,library hulu netflix going to the cinema and art theater i havent had to torrent much at all anymore except a couple really obscure older flicks that no agency would spy on anyway
movies,removed,im not gonna see this i hate eastwood as a director these days everything he does is oscar bait and very paint by the numbers
movies,removed,one of the chinks in the japanese tsunami did just that there is something about human nature where you accept death like that
movies,removed,httpmedmediaperscom
movies,removed,still hot
movies,removed,
movies,removed,i came across it on a torrent site that title gave it away as a parody which is why i assumed it was bad most parody movies scary movie not another whatever the fuck ect are complete trash a parody movie about pop stars seems like it would be a garbage fire
movies,removed,its weird to watch people make the logic jump that one person watching the movie illegally equates to one less ticket sold i suppose it gives them someone to rail at when their movie fails
movies,removed,i am a director who has put my own movie on pirate sitestorrents and find his attitude sad he should be thanking the heavens everyday that he has the institutional support and marketing behemoth behind him that make people watch his movie he is a fat cat pretending to be a scrappy filmmaker pretending he has his crews interest in mind is disgusting as well
movies,removed,youre oversimplifying this issue if you think its not a gray area lets say i torrent dumb and dumber because i was bored what is the alternative that id actually pay money to see it i would never do that so who exactly was hurt by my pirating why do you think is so absolutely and objectively wrong
movies,removed,so youre just going to act retarded without actually having an argument nothing was stolen
movies,removed,the reason i dont really give a shit about what hes saying is because of the movies i torrent and watch i wouldnt have watched if they werent free so that studio was never going to get my money anyway
movies,removed,i do understand the problem ive heard the entire but how else am i supposed to see it side of the argument my problem is with the people who dont care to look for alternative legal ways to obtain the content they just think they shouldnt have to pay for it at all so fuck you right back
movies,removed,eat a dick you miserable fuck that better
movies,removed,not a movie but oberon martells death in game of thrones was traumatic
movies,removed,that movie of my wedding where i say i do hate that movie
movies,removed,its a torrent of the force awakens this time
movies,removed,did his role cast a negative light about hillary clinton
movies,removed,hey these btown beauties wear a lot of great costumes i feel they are just incredible
movies,removed,i just love these ladies
movies,removed,star wars the force awakens mediocre movie that bafflingly got almost a complete pass for pretty much recycling the plot of the first film my first eye roll came when finn was so gleeful to kill storm troopers that he was part of like five minutes ago oh how about the scene where he wants to help rey but she beats up three or four assassins because shes a strong womyn who dont nees no man so clumsily done kylo ren i dont even know they emotion they wanted the audience to feel empathy fear derision i feel they always undermined almost everything the audience felt in like the very next scene rey was written as a bit too special which wouldnt be a problem if it wasnt so clumsily done the scene where i realized that star wars wasnt for me anymore was when sola and chewbacca were in a shootout and solo looked so casual quipping lasers flying around but when pops out he gets a trooper easily i cant overlook that kind of stuff anymore it honestly felt like they were in no danger at all and please dont tell me its just a fun movie in fellowship of the ring when the wraiths were after frodo in the way to the prancing pony i knew they would survive but the direction was so good it tricks ones mind and you feel actual tension i never felt one moment of tension and when han solo died i saw it from a mile away you just knew that he wasnt really in danger until the director gets his important moment reminds me of how they show a characters life story in an anime you know damn well that nigga is a goner lmao and what makes me really hate it is that people rate it so highly even critics best of the year lists really episode one also got a lot of hype and initial fan reviews completely bought into it think oasis be here now but now i think with the internet hype is even more potent and even critics are susceptible to it plus i think many were rooting for it to succeed simply because of the female and black dude main characters im convinced that this is one movie which will not hold up sort of like avatar after all the noise and when people are not so invested in it it will be re evaluated also i just think jj abrams makes okayish sci fi movies ive heard good stuff about the second cloverfield though i loved the star wars universe as a kid and there is no way there arent amazing stories to tell by a director who is allowed to do his own thing to an extent while were at it i fucking loathe the family stuff must every one be related who are reys parents i cant believe people care really the mysterious parentage where is the suspense you know damn it is someone important like must almost everything be a family thing too many important characters are related and its boring because its been done so many times that it becomes cliche so we have an amazing universe sci fi or fantasy ir whatever and suddenly it becomes just a family drama in space or a family drama with elves it often takes away from the alienness because its so damn familiar think that terrible and expensive dinosaur show where people traveled back in time just to have the same old shit what was it called again honestly maybe its just the type of movie that im over no tension ludicrous plot in space and suddenly solo family drama its so familiar im surprised any adults like it its probably a blast for kids because theyre not familiar with tropes there is no way you can tell me there arent more interesting original stories that can be written about the star wars universe ie bring back the trade federation
movies,removed,was he going to testify against hillary too
movies,removed,ikr dat nigga dead
movies,removed,i love amy adams beautiful and talent actress here her best movies performance httptibbanetpostamyadamsbestmoviesperformance
movies,removed,this movie looks awesome i had an armenian friend who invited me to his wedding they had full bottles of belvedere vodka on each table like of them it was a fine time and i was carried around on giant armenian shoulders and declared a true armenian because i refused to mix my vodka with anything also fuck turkey in their goats asses
movies,removed,yay another diverse movie where the bad guys are all disposable white men probably should have given them all british accents just to make everyone completely comfortable
movies,removed,even if you have power that change crowds minds with comertial movie capitalist weapons facts are not change if you guys realy interest history please read history httpfactcheckarmeniacom
movies,removed,pseudophilosophical garbage logic whatever andy griffith still got paid regardless of whether i downloaded the torrent recorded the show while it was playing on tv found the dvd set in the dumpster or used binoculars to watch the show through a neighbors window the point is that one way is considered stealing but somehow the rest arent i still havent heard a compelling argument as to why streaming a file should be treated any differently than the other methods
movies,removed,damn this bitch has some weird eye balls
movies,removed,my logic wasnt absurd im not willing to pay money to see a movie that i already know well in advance is a terrible movie however when its available to me for free ill actually consider watching it it would be completely insane for me to pay money to something that i know is a bad product im not cheap or entitled most recent movie i paid to see was the new jason bourne i happily pay for performances of things ill enjoy or think ill enjoy my point was that seeds on before i waketorrent is not unsold tickets you seem to have gotten very upset when i proved this with my ben hur example
movies,removed,nigga what you talking about
movies,removed,eh i just want to see the full frontal and maybe catch the sextape when she and the rest of the world finally realizes she cant act and isnt worth anything
movies,removed,sacred lands lol its just dirt dude
movies,removed,it might sound crazy but there is supporting theories that lead people to believe that the clintons have had or tried to kill people in the past for instance obamas jett needing to take an emergency landing during the presidential primaries when he was running against hillary just havent seen that happen in my lifetime also michael hastings a lead journalist for the rolling stone magazine who broke the mccrystal story that caused him to resign mysteriously had his car engine explode in which case he died and his body was said to have been cremated without his families concentamong other clinton or politically driven horror stories ive heard so in that sense it wouldnt be political to talk about hillary if it has some baring it would just be within reason to think in todays world people wouldnt be involved in that sort of thing
movies,removed,and because glenn beck is a nutjob he must be lying about this if you think that beck quote is bad here are some quotes directly for gibsons mouth you look like a fucking pig in heat and if you get raped by a pack of niggers it will be your fault fucking jews the jews are responsible for all the wars in the world are you a jew i am going to come and burn the fucking house down but you will blow me first
movies,removed,why yo so heavy on my dick with yo bullshit go get you some money nigga
movies,removed,
movies,removed,whats hes thinking is the fucking truth jews have been hostile to the passion of the christ from day one they put every impediment in gibsons path they could find to make the movie a flop but it was a success anyway and they hate gibson for that for showing that in spite of all the jewish power in hollywood a christian can still succeed
movies,removed,ahh yes another genocide movie that serves those in power those movies about the slaughter and dispossession of precolumbian cultures is coming down the pipeline any day now right they can start filming in dakota they can just use cgi to edit out the pipeline and attack dawgs
movies,removed,its a nigga on a horse
movies,removed,let bernard lewis explain in minutes what happened
movies,removed,dont im a filmmaker anyone can call themselves anything they want online especially if they insist on remaining anonymous it sickens me to listen to other filmmakers cry about how piracy hurts hundreds of people that worked on his movie when what actually hurts them is a studio system that makes it impossible for them to reach wider audiences and uses deficit financing bullshit accounting to screw hard working people out of points and residuals that they agreed to pay via contract a studio system that makes it impossible for them to reach a wider audience thats literally what every film wants a wider audience and thats also why studios spend so much on marketing they dont make it impossible they just dont do it the way you want if he wants his film to not be pirated he should go pitch his next project to netflix or shut the fuck up if putting your work on netflix prevents it from being pirated how did house of cards end up on the pirate bay
movies,removed,theyre is literally another user with at least downvotes so the answer is no
movies,removed,you see even though you are an idiot ill explain to you what it means youre an insufferable prick
movies,removed,did you just assume someones gender
movies,removed,british
movies,removed,if its anything like what they did with peter cushing from the new star wars movie who had quite a bit of significant screen time it will work
movies,removed,well at least we have the tomb raider reboot to look forward to
movies,removed,the awesomeness of the cast and crew pisses me off because it was always gonna be bad honestly
movies,removed,oh god mortal kombat please be good
movies,removed,its trash surprise

movies,removed,well we got that out of our system so whats next mass effect bioshock oj thats right theyre goingto try tomb raider again
movies,removed,looked like a corny video game movie and thats what it turned out to be surprise surprise
movies,removed,new funny video bd vines
movies,removed,why am i not surprised at the rt score the trailers were dull and it seems like the movie as most all video game adaptions is too
movies,removed,and to think this is the movie they paid jennifer lawrence considerably more than chris pratt for after her war against the man lets see when her next big payday is
movies,removed,oh so i should wait and download the torrent
movies,removed,are people genuinely surprised by this when has there ever been a good video game movie especially on such a dodgy franchise like ac
movies,removed,assassins creed another unfortunate setback for video game adaptations fulll review
movies,removed,heres to the half life and portal movies being good
movies,removed,your blog is very nicethis is the world of best site
movies,removed,no it is irony since youre berating my personal views of what id like to see while advocating that anyone should say what theyd like to see without being berated because thousands of people watched popeye during its prime and they didnt walk around eating spinach constantly and going yuk yuk yuk conversely the emoji movie will imprint because emojis are already ingrained into youth culture emojis are easier to adopt into a language because they are just a fingertap and frankly dumber to use not remotely comparable to changing actual speech patterns youre missing the point it could be anything getting a massive face tattoo of a multicolored dragon moving away from your family in oregon to live in a lone cabin in rural alaska being a vegan personal enjoyment doesnt trump criticism if i see something stupid i am going to voice that its stupid and i think they should changemake a different decision i imagine youre a very simple person possibly uneducated you hold this value close to your heart because it makes you feel as though youre doing the right thing and that youre making others happy unfortunately relativism is a very cancerous and counterproductive value to have
movies,removed,man i guess uno the movie is still the best video game movie ever what a shame
movies,removed,i have no respect for her after she raped a guy
movies,removed,cant trust reddits opinion on this one
movies,removed,i said this in a different thread but let it be known that patriots day from director peter berg battleship of all people will usher in the highest rated film of december not even morten tyldum the imitation game garth jennings hitchhikers guide to the galaxy or justin kurzel macbeth could bring forth a movie everyone can agree on come this wednesday in december is a dark year indeed
movies,removed,i was going to skip this one until i read bruce kirklands review that might put it into the mustseewithfriends category for me
movies,removed,how could a film with such an interesting source material be so boring every moment outside of the was dull and those scenes in century spain were ruined by constant cutaways it just might be time to accept the game over for video game movies full review
movies,removed,the reviews are basically calling this date rape the movie so this seems like a hard pass
movies,removed,i torrented this movie and it sucked so bad i want my money backerik salvia
movies,removed,so the poor posters designs was a foreshadowing for something awful i see

movies,removed,point out where i attacked anybody then everything i have said was just an accurate observation like i said if youre upset im being blunt get over it the fact you are trying to use some imaginary position of power to intimidate me is hilarious in itself what do you moderate rneckbeardsanonymous rthegoddelusion lol that was an insult
movies,removed,why do you think there are so many jews in hollywood many people believe its because of their bigotry towards blacks latinos asians etc which is why they only tend to work with people that look like themselves so basically what im asking is will you admit your jew privilege
movies,removed,callum lynch is the most videogame name ever
movies,removed,i havent been antagonistic to anybody thats a matter of perception it would help if you actually described why i need help i would argue youre the one being antagonistic implying im disturbed or unhinged seriously what have i said that was just so incredibly vile that you think im a sociopath can you point to anything otherwise this is just a witchhunt out for me because i said blunt comments that ultimately appear true
movies,removed,dont be such a faggot its not up to the internet to parent your kid
movies,removed,didnt he play piano on a couple of dead mans bones tracks
movies,removed,i just came here to ask if the was worth the money please no spoilers thanks
movies,removed,the one person i know that saw dr strange hated it all three of the clips were bad i fully expect to hate it when it makes its way to torrent sites the amount of fanboy hype over it in rmovies was ridiculous
movies,removed,but its hypocritical because you actually are insulting me lol so either youre just as bad as me or neither of us are
movies,removed,then we all agree that youre autistic because that explains everything really
movies,removed,havent seen the movie and after reading most of these comments i really have less of a desire than before which was already pretty low but im dying to know how it ends looked up the script and it said something about people of all ages leaving the ship hows it really end been scrolling for a while and cant find anything save me my money please

movies,removed,i have no sympathy for him regardless of what he was watching people die thats what they do i do have contempt for him due to his choices but i couldnt possibly care less that he died regardless now if i see his wife and kids im not going to scream at them that their loved one was an asshole because of his shitty taste in movies i dont care that he is dead you dont really care that he is dead its just the socially acceptable way to act when someone dies but most people just arent willing to admit that they dont really give a shit outside of the twinge of emotion at the reminder that you will be dead soon with certainty and there is nothing you can do about it
movies,removed,who the fuck are you

movies,removed,what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
movies,removed,i feel like there is some truth to this disney seems less focused on making a good story and more on making the franchise fit liberal values it is no secret that the place is run by gays now which would be fine until this actually starts having negative impact on the quality of the films they are producing and then it all suddenly makes sense i was very disappointed in force awakens and im not watching any more star wars movies im not going to support crap art
movies,removed,han solo dies
movies,removed,theres no unnatural demographic change the demographic shifts can be explained entirely by natural factors such as the continued economic oppression of black and hispanic residents resulting in larger population booms due to their greater presence in poorer lesseducated demographics or the fact that biracial persons have a significant tendency to identify with their nonwhite parents ethnicity this is patently wrong our demographics have changed due to the immigration act of and if youd watch that video youd understand we had to open up our borders more for purely economic reasons to stay competetive in a changing world and due to our agricultural needs and the growing unwillingness of american citizens to work those jobs it could not and cannot be restricted to only highly skilled peoples it was and still is good policy i should ducking know i had my immigration and citizenship final last week none of this is true it was literally done by jewish supremacists that want to push exactly what you want and those seeking cheap labor look at who pushed those laws you wont though call me antisemitic if you like but i do make the distinction between elite jews and your everyday jewish dentist you say that im forcing stuff i say that only racists think that greater diversity is forced most americans are cool with it most americans actually welcome it were a nation of immigrants from all over the world and most of us recognize that our diversity is our strength so we dont have to force interracial relationships people of all races are champing at the bit to let their freak flag fly with people of all colors and creeds as it is most americans are not cool with the massive demographic changes they know something is wrong and people like you are literally making them real racists you say im a racist i say you dont understand what that word means theres no such thing as antiwhite racism in america racism isnt prejudice its institutional discrimination i am not advocating for policy or social movement that disadvantages white folks in any way i just want to see them carry their own weight for once you are the definition of racist that whole paragraph is racist also to let you know it was designed by jewish academics specifically to create racial divide you just down know it its part of the war on whiteness its very sneaky but it wont work as far as carrying their own weight whites have led the world and theyve done it on their own with very little help whites are a noble race hell one white man alone has saved over a billion livesnorman borlaug you cant even begin to list all the inventions and creations there isnt enough time in the day by the way the root word of slave is slavyou know white people what you really want is for whites to hate themselves and to let evil people like you take the reigns and snuff them out its funny though youd only be destroying yourself without whites things tend to go down hill very rapidly
movies,removed,you seem like a huge fag
movies,removed,anyone have pics of her ass
movies,removed,surprised by all the mild to enthusiastic reviews here thought it was a shitty movie for the following reasons poor characterization rey may have been a mary sue but she was at least a mary sue you could root for and whose decisions largely made sense in tfa jyn is basically a lesser version of her reluctant to join the rebellion orphaned good with wielding weapons moreover are star wars female leads only allowed to be brunette white females all the characters were flat and dimensional and you never understand why they chose to do what they did or even their general goal most glaring with jyn in particular but also applies to cassian saw herrera etc plus there were too many characters did we really need the blind guy and his muscleman meaningless deaths i believe that deaths should happen for the following reasons it advances the story forward it makes the audience care about the work or it just makes sense within the story would it have made a difference to have an alive whitaker mikkelsen especially if everyone was going to die anyway and truthfully due to poor characterization i didnt care about the fates of the characters terrible lines i am the force and the force is within me really lack of banter unmotivating speeches etc and may the force be with you somehow managed to evolve into a goodbye hello good luck rest in peace and a mantra logical inconsistencies so how come the octopus of truth didnt affect the pilots brain why would princess leia be referred to as a jedi and finally no opening rolling text what you cant remove those i did like the destroyjeddah special effects and the darth vader ending scene though
movies,removed,dude gets scalped and then cut in half starting at the balls whats the big deal

movies,removed,i know for a fact that a majority between the coasts are ignorant hillbillies amazing lol and youll call trump a prejudice bigot right
movies,removed,do you not understand that it feeds into lgbt bigotry by assuming they choose to be as they are it doesnt sally like for example id love to call you a faggot which im not because im a respectful redditor who would never condone such personal attacks but i if i did which i am not it wouldnt be a slander against homosexuals who i respect it would be term used to describe whiny little liberals
movies,removed,are you fucking retarded i mean i wont knock it on a personal level but it still makes me respect ayer less as a writerdirector your own words it wasnt his decision to create the new he didnt make her the way she is he just used the characters he was told to use in their current form stop being a shithead guy

movies,removed,its was good id recommend scifi fans go see it for sure i dont think i need to recommend it to star wars fans the droid was probably my favorite part i thought the acting was decent quick question i dont recall everything about episode but wasnt it kind of a joke that the death star was so easy to take out spoilers did they seriously put an end to that in like bits of dialogue or did we already know why it was so easy to take out the death star
movies,removed,i dont see the logic milo calls himself a faggot but im damn sure not going to call him that and its not about someone being or not being a bigot its about validating their views
movies,removed,they got the plans when they transmitted them from the antenna the planet got destroyed only after the data was sent that was the whole meaning of the last scene where they were passing off the data

movies,removed,the last scene with vader was well done
movies,removed,the last third of the movie was something id wants to see on screen for the past years this this is exactly what elevated the movie for me the first acts were shakey but that last part was perfect massive space battles with actual models check brutal and stretched out ground battles check vader going ham check

movies,removed,television benefits from studio infrastructure that films generally dont get to exploit combined with lower wages for actorscrew and lower production costs the budget for television is going to be lower dont forget that its easier to get a television series made than a feature film television automatically gets hedged against advertising commitments which offsets the cost even in the case of a premium paid subscription model or perhaps because of it the network hbo showtime etc considers even second tier series a good investment because they can act as a mechanism to retain subscribers while they wait for another season of got or whatever essentially they are producing their own advertising movies on the other hand are not financed or produced with any sort of understandable regularity every single production is the equivalent of starting a brand new company with over employees from scratch the money often comes from wealthy individuals with star fucker attitudes who have little to no experience with hollywood or it comes from a major financial investment bank as a line of credit and those niggas gots to get paid so without the advertising commitments pre sales to offset costs the feature film is going to cost more of course none of this accounts for the downtime between tv shows and films that castcrew must endure but is more of a symptom of the production cycle i think

movies,removed,he does but please do not make him the next james bond that would be a tragedy
movies,removed,why would he be acting that way cause hes an actor no ffs thats not what i meant why is bond acting like he is upperclass if hes not what is the motivation for bond who is now a black man to adopt an upperclass persona choosing that personality as a cover doesnt carry any logic for a black guy whereas before it was just who bond wasis he was an upperclass individual so you dont even have to wonder why he acts like that its not realistic to have a black man be upperclass but without that facet to bonds character he ceases to be the same so you have to explain why a guy that wouldnt be upperclass is acting like he is i think any not racist audience would understand a black man in a suit with a silenced pistol this isnt about racism its unbelievable how narrow your view is while accusing everyone of bigotry if i was saying that bond cant be black because black people arent smart enough or charming enough that would be racist what im saying isnt so much about race as it is about social history for anyone that knows anything about british society having a black man act like he descended from lords is not believable unless you bought chris eubanks shtick acknowledging that fact is in no way racist like at all youre basically asking me to deny reality just so i dont seem racist to people like yourself bond is a fake persona hes always been played by actors before do you not know what a movie is dunningkruger effect is strong here im talking about how a black bond means that his upperclass behaviour would be just a fake persona and then how in comparison that a white upperclass bond is just who he is so basically youre not interpreting what im saying correctly fella

movies,removed,i dont want to offend you since you seem like you make a career out of snap decisions but you have only seen a few seconds of a first trailer teaser there is no way you can say this movie doesnt looks remotely interesting because you havent seen any kind of plot point yet you have seen a few clips that were thrown together so try and be well not even open minded but for you i guess try keeping the chain off the door the deadbolts unlocked the door knob unlocked and if this is even possible for you just turn that door knob and dont even actually crack it just kind of let the door latch slide out slightly do you think you can do that
movies,removed,youre an idiot we didnt need a third spider man we barely needed the first two this is just marvel beating the super hero garbage to absolute fucking death because they know they could film princess dianas dead body bring raped by a bunch of guys dressed as spider man and you retards would still go see it

movies,removed,the trailer for deadpool made me cringe so hard even as a kid that comic made me cringe add ryan reynolds into the mix and id rather a slap in the face seriously i would rather get slapped hard in the face than sit through minutes of deadpool anyway the whole idea of sausage party is pretty cringey and lame for the first time seth rogen falls short for me i will probably give sausage party a chance on the old torrent rounds
movies,removed,up yours nigger

movies,removed,fuck you mods
movies,removed,the popcorn is how theaters make money if the charged you a film it would cheapen the value and profitability of streaming sales of you paid in the theater why would you pay nearly the same amount months later on a mobile device the answer most people wouldnt theyd want it for cents or torrent it instead
movies,removed,yeah i dont even have cable just netflix amazon prime and torrents and i never see movie trailers on any of the youtube channels i watch so if i dont see a movie on this sub or any of the other movie subs i go on it will very certainly pass me by
movies,removed,rdccinematic sucks each other off like fucbois why arent you guys over there

movies,removed,yeah lol poor fucking jews never forget the holocaust lets keep forcing over holocaust related films down your throats every year fuck off
movies,removed,the problem is too many people arent going to get it theyre going to hear the word nigger said as a punchline and react in outrage the movie is not making fun of black people and honestly its not even making fun of ignorant rednecks its parodying the perception people have of ignorant rednecks as perceived by hollywood its a movie making fun of classic hollywood tropes used in westerns you cant say the movie is making fun of rednecks in reality because theyre too damn silly theres no one like that in reality everything is over the top and has nothing to do with reality which gives it license to be so outrageous btw the script was cowritten richard pryor so that should explain a lot however the problem with blazing saddles not being made today political correctness is only part of the issue the movie was made at the tail end of the dynasty of western films being made for two generations it was released when there were quite a a few parodies of western films such as support your local sheriff a man named nobody the shakiest gun in the west and several others so it was very in step with the times people understood this movie was filled with very familiar tropes and that was what it was making fun of since westerns have been out of style for so long to make a movie like blazing saddles today you would have to pick a different genre and make fun of the tropes they use and people are making those movies like deadpool which is every bit as hardcore as blazing saddles ever was

movies,removed,need i remind you that seth rogen came out and apologized to the lgbt activists who were protesting superbad because of them repeatedly using the word faggot despite it making perfect sense within the high school setting of the film the sjw censorship police is not mythical its real there is a group of people who want to push their personal political agenda into various industries movies video games science business and members of this group have placed themselves in positions of power and responsibility in these industry be it as journalists critics etc and these people cause a social media stink every time a movie is released or opinion is stated that doesnt conform with their political point of view smearing the brands of the companies the names the artists and people behind the movies and the reputations of the people who enjoy them in the eyes of the general public and companies will almost always choose to self censor themselves and lose money in the short term in the name of protecting the reputation of their brand from smearing in the eyes of potential new customers in the name of long term profits money may come and go but if your brand is poisoned by negative public opinion and word of mouth you better start applying for unemployment benefits why do you think disney began phasing out all the star wars slave leia merchandise why do you think video game companies like nintendo and bandai namco are removing things like cleavage and sexy alternate outfits in their games why do you think ad companies have stopped producing ads like because they know if they dont theyll get smeared in the eyes of the media their brand will take a hit and theyll lose money

movies,removed,can we take a moment to address the fact that they couldnt even put any effort into creating an original teaser poster maybe its being nitpicky but it could say a lot about the effort they put into the actual film
movies,removed,yep i think you hit the nail on the head mediocre trailer and the fact its a remake with an all female cast of a beloved classic i guess im just disappointed people arent at least giving it a chance fucking torrent it if you dont want to buy a ticket before actually making an opinion hell arent the original cast all for this movie dont they even have cameos and stuff

movies,removed,sadly im still kind of in the if it isnt on netflix and if the redbox within walking distance of my apartment doesnt have it i know the pirate bay will kind of mentality i dont want to own some movies on itunes some on amazon some through whatever sonys network is some through xbox live its just too many digital accounts to keep track of and the idea of paying for a digital rental seems silly when a physical rental is
movies,removed,thats odd i can still watch it on torrents must not have come into effect yet
movies,removed,and they wonder why the pirate bay exists
movies,removed,it was a joke moron
movies,removed,everything is still on piratebay for some reason tho
movies,removed,all links online dead no seeders for any torrents any suggestions
movies,removed,you did just with the word indian switched for sociopath but its not how you meant it or how you interpreted it its how i clarified it switching a word doesnt prove your point stick to mental health if thats your realm linguistics clearly arent but that sociopathy is on the autism spectrum as in every sociopath is on the autism spectrum not the other way around and thats where you misunderstood me i clarified days ago that some people with aspd might be on the spectrum you can take my original comment and put some in there and everythings clear i just disagree with the assertion that sociopaths are probably somewhere snugly nestled on that autism spectrum some of them are i literally forgot one word clarified it in the very next comment and yet here you are mindlessly arguing about it fair enough now that youve clarified what you mean i dont disagree with you i clarified days ago youre just kinda slow
movies,removed,because it doesnt matter if i dont have the service ill just torrent it or find it on a file locker once youre looking for stuff online this shit doesnt matter amazon is one of the worst ones not having a monthly subscription i technically pay more for netflix but doing so is more convenient sure i could create a savings account for amazon but thats too much bother with other options the way you win at this is to compete with piracy if exclusives help with that great if not it wont last
movies,removed,time for torrentstm

movies,removed,i dont think there will be a gay or straight distinction then either sexuality is too fluid for it
movies,removed,in the postcredits scene john cho takes it up the ass from takei
movies,removed,my thoughts exactly i didnt see it promoted anywhere on the internet or social media the only two places i saw adverts for it were the movie poster at my local cinema and a few commercials on tv i generally dont watch cablesatellite tv its either streaming or torrents it seems like they failed miserably at promoting this movie and the mystery surrounding the initial trailer didnt help gain any interest in it at least for me it didnt i still havent any idea what the god damn film is about piss poor execution on the promotion side of things
movies,removed,make a torrent
movies,removed,cuck

movies,removed,the director and some of the cast preemptivley made it seem that the hate was because of the women when in my opinion it was judged on the preview they had a political agenda and most of the positive reviews also share that agenda for those saying to judge it for myself ill have to wait for the torrent i wont pay for it based on what i saw in the trailers i absolutely do not believe any of the reviews that use politically charged language to demonize people that dont like the movie based on the trailer

movies,removed,as a ukrainian its kind of a shame no one here knows or heard about this movie on a related note i cant find it on torrents which is also strange
movies,removed,since youre so fucking stupid let me put this in analogous format that your pea brain can understand if you go around your hometown shouting i hate niggers nobody is going to trust your opinion regarding the next kevin hart movie pull your head out of your ass and quit being so obtuse the man politely explained it to you three times already
movies,removed,what movie i dont dislike ghostbusters i look forward to seeing it on torrent but its clear that both camps are blind and biased i am neutral i think it looks like a fun forgettable comedy
movies,removed,that sounds like all the transformers movies just pointless noise and fury signifying nothing token hot girl and a robonigga i never went to see any of those in a cinema but im pretty sure i would have walked out if i had was it that bad
movies,removed,and as someone nicely pointed out on rmovies most of those reviewers have been praising the movie long before their saw it and have been writing positive pieces for the last months totally objective reviewers without an agenda lets see what happens when there are objective reviews
movies,removed,most of the reviewers have an agenda
movies,removed,do you always take it so personal to the point of insulting people when someone doesnt like a movie that your mommy took you to see asswipe

movies,removed,my favorite thing about this thread are how people are getting salty and deleting there comments we all knew it was going to be a shitty movie once they stop caring about it being fun to watch but rather used it to push the agenda of we are all sexist fucks it sucks but thats the way the world is and thats the way its headedif you dont agree with someone you are either a cuck shill sexist misogynistic or whatever buzzword either side wants to call you it just seems like fun in every median is dying and its sad

movies,removed,that or monster squad which i recently revisited all of the kids spend the first minutes calling each other faggot im pretty sure that would almost net you an r rating today
movies,removed,plot synopsis of finding dory a physically disabled boys mentally disabled female friend wanders off looking for the parents she cant remember and cant remember the way home the boys father agrees to help the boy look for his friend many amusing events result from the inability of the girl to recall events of even a few minutes ago most everyone tries to be helpful but clumsiness and inability to communicate and understand what the others want lead to more amusing scenes other characters are also introduce including several who also have amusing mental or physical disabilities in the end the girl finds her long lost parents so the movie is presumed to be uplifting
movies,removed,and when the two girls tell him about the sanctuary he doesnt believe them he says thats impossible because everyone is dead he was the last man on earth in the book the movie marketed it as such but the big twist in the movie is he just assumed everyone else was dead doing next to nothing to confirm such fact
movies,removed,yeah gonna call citation needed on this because youre throwing a lot of hyperbolic claims around also cucked can women be cucks can gay people be cucks
movies,removed,you want some real homophobic language revisit jay and silent bob strike back i revisited it in the past few years and wow sooooooooo many fags and whatnot

movies,removed,james bond is a fictional character so whatever takes place in his novels or movies are fictional the character is written as someone who is extremely handsome and charming someone who is desired by many women so initially it looks like he forces himself on these women but eventually they all relented if you want to look at it from another angle it would be the equivalent to adriana lima forcing herself on a man very few men can resist so bond is the male equivalent of lima also the time when some of the older bond movies were made many women would play hard to get it just wasnt as socially acceptable to be promiscuous for women back then

movies,removed,i apologize but i see everyone making the point that it was a chinese film companies choice to choose whatever actors it saw fit well theres that but why the fuck wouldnt a hollywood production have white actors in it i want to live in a world where bollywood can make movies on any subject and have indian actors in their films to show their culturally unique perspective on past world events i want their to be bollywood views and hollywood views and chink views all peoples can make a great wall movie and anyone who has a problem with the fact that a film has too many cast members of unauthentic race can go fuck their xenophobic selves youre adrift in a white world western supremacy is a very real phenomenon given the fact white people have always made up such a small percentage of the global population get prepared for a century of space exploration artificial intelligence and martian babies
movies,removed,this movie is for the person that has a wild imagination about what could be out in deep space loved it the director was able to capture the essence of the original star trek television show from the with todays cgi hard to really explain it you just have to watch it and preferrably in an imax or arclight theater to get the whole experience the cgi was spectacular and didnt leave you feeling drunk off of it in the end i found myself getting lost in the what ifs like what the bad guy had control of what if there were weaponry out there like what the bad guy had control of somewhere in deep space probably one of the craziest type of weapon ever in a scifi movie haha really cool concept they came up with many other reasons this movie was one of the best scifi flicks ive seen the visuals and direction was exceptionally awesome just enough humor in it for it not to fall flat on its face
movies,removed,star trek has never been more visually stunning that star trek beyon is it is a brilliant combination of action adventure visuality humor and even emotionally it is great to see that suluhas a husband and they have a little daughter true family star trek way like it was originally back with black woman as one of the leading actors true pioneer of its own era and today star trek beyond is once again its own originality which can be proud proud of all the old trekkies as well as newer audience yorktown has set stunningly way we never have seen before on silver screen movie visuality combined with its camera drive is simply breathtaking two hour roller coast ride gravity is used cleverly on set and the movies action and speed nails you to your seat script is imaginative and even funny movie achieve beautifully star trek originality it is a great honor for fifty year old saga movies visuality is best in and i saw it under finnkinos scape concept camera drive and makes movie enjoyable to watch i know that i am a trekkie but i am sure that even newer audience can enjoy of its thrilled action packet star trek beyond is simply stunning space opera which retain its interest even after many watching hopefully we can enjoy many great star trek movies in the future
movies,removed,great pick for both story and director jj entrusted the right person to keep the franchise moving along at warp speed and even the most fanatical trekie will be hard put to find fault not only did they advance this story time line but they stayed true to genes vision the weave of old and new scientific and pop culture interpersonal relations and individual motivations are all of what made the original star trek grab the publics attention acting was spot on everyone once again prove the profession by transporting the audience into that world the tribute to both leonard and anton was appreciated and example of the class act from the franchise happy birthday star trek live long and prosper
movies,removed,i love star trek i also loved the movie i often wonder why so many people go into these extended reviews as to why or why not they liked or did not like a film hey i just want to be entertained for a few hours and thats about it the truth is everyone is different and the reasons notwithstanding its each persons individual tastes in film i think the same about music with that said ive loved star trek since the late and i love the new crew of the enterprise i love the interaction and bond between them and that is what pulls me back time after time so just go to see it for the crew the story and the fun
movies,removed,i really enjoyed the jj abrams star trek films and after the final trailer i was excited for this film and once again this film is a fantastic addition to the star trek lore the premise of this film sees the crew of the enterprise years into their mission attacked by a mysterious enemy which sees the crew stranded and separated on a planet chris pine is back playing captain kirk and in this film i would say he is more like the character then ever before he is a likable captain but also keeps that humour and cool guy that he has been in all these films they also add a bit of drama to his character in this film involving his father zachary quinto plays spock and he has allot of development in this film as he becomes even more interesting and even funny in this film his chemistry especially with bones is great my favourite character in this film is dr mccoy played by karl urban he was really funny in this film and he develops as a character especially with spock zoe saldana plays uhura and she is great she has a interesting dynamic with the villain and i thought her relationship with spock developed in this film simon pegg wrote this film and he is really funny as scottie who is given more to do in this film and his character is given way more depth sofia boutella plays jaylah a new alien character who is great in this film and works really well with the cast idris elba plays the villain krall and he does a good job his voice is very booming and his presence is felt his character is interesting and has a good twist to him the story never stops moving and i like the way the characters are separated but all of them feel important the villain plot is simple but towards the end of the film it does become interesting and the stakes are pretty high the script is really good it has some really good humour in it mixed with some good dramatic character moments that truly make you care about the characters the style has some great visual effects and great space battles unfortunately some of the hand to hand combat scenes have allot of shaky cam that is hard to follow what is going on this is a fantastic fun star trek film that is definitely worth a watch also rest in peace to leonard nemoy and anton yelchin who is fantastic in this film

movies,removed,almost all of the underpantssuperhero genre to date they have been some of the worse films blighting modern cinema every time you say one is okay you get soon more that are absolutely horrendous the problem is they have lost that comic book appeal they just mass produce them rolling them so quick that they feel completely rushed there is this big collage of cgi that doesnt add much effect and they soon change the comic story adding something so absurd it is ridiculous ironman dark knight rises avengers xmen wolverine winter soldier and so many more they soon provide more lines too boost the characters screen image and time prolonging everything comic book and then they set them into a much younger demographics for year olds taking away all the grit and adding unicorns most of these comics are when i think of comic book i think of the crank or raid films and the latest dredd instead we have every hipster wanting to play dress up and it resulting in the superpants underpants genre of total diapers i barely suffered watching daredevil when that film blew donkeys if he got swords why he always use guns and right away that tells you its a heap of pants

movies,removed,deadpool literally blew goats it wasnt a superhero just some hipster playing dress up that film was absolutely awful some paid smugs hyped it by promoting fake reviews everywhere like about how we needed some antihero to save the genre and reestablish comic bookism wrong try again setting it into an rrated setting and fire the damn hipster and get a ninja in at least somebody wholl swing a sword without popping in their pants first and somebody who doesnt need even more screen image time ryan reynolds ryan reynolds who is the deadpool im ryan reynolds taking away from everything comicbook
movies,removed,i will repeat goats you got blown did you diapering wearing hipster probably never seen an film in all their life who is the deadpool what is the deadpool no it was not a hipster going to a costume ball thats the problem with the genre today nothing comic book left just a fancy dress party smurfed down to their wannabes
movies,removed,i fine i hate stupid fascist media reddit couldnt be any worse if it tried where dumb idiots most are gutter trash the demographic for this platform is the gutter then go and vote on what people say but the only people who get voted are those with a dick in their mouth everybody who doesnt want a dick in their mouth questioning that topic gets attacked and trolled deadpool was utter feces thatfilm literally made me vomit it was awful as awful as batman vs superman deadpool should have been about a ninja not some hipster with sass shouting ryan reynolds every two seconds he had two ninja swords he never used because he got twin uzi guns instead he is antiheor so why was shield all over him when he kills inhumans if that was an rrating i dont know what i am watching nothing r about it nothing at all
movies,removed,of course you would say a movie where absolutely nothing happens is realistic as if real life has no drama this is one of the most boring and pointless films ive ever seen built for film elitists who want to find greatness where nothing is there

movies,removed,good to know is there anything special about the xperia or is that just general compatibility with android im on android too so thatd be pretty useful though my main problem was that i like to torrent a bit and i also use a windows device id often get a lot of video formats say mkv that needed to play in something like vlc which at least at that time wouldnt get picked up to cast chromeonly browser compatibility was mildly infuriating to me as well i know this isnt a common opinion but i actually prefer edge for most of my browsing because the interface works significantly better with my touch screen and with something like netflix for example id prefer the interface of the windows netflix app as opposed to being forced to play it through chrome

movies,removed,sounds about right when i visited years ago i noticed people were generally relaxed about crudesexual humor and swearing in general but anything remotely gay was always associated with the worst thing imaginable the family i stayed with one night the dad says something like i cant believe the intolerance of these faggots like its the most normal and nonbigoted thing one could say he was watching the news and they were covering a gay pride event in one of the cities he considered them intolerant of heterosexuals because they gross him out then he proceeded to rant about the treatment of aborigines again spurred by the news and how much of a horrendous existence theyve been forced into by institutional racism theres a similar mentality with some americans too but it was a bit of a taken aback moment the guy is someone that id call centerleft in america until the faggot poofters came on tv

movies,removed,the movie reminds me of ted chiang story of your life short story which is a must read for sifi fans if you google it you can read it online for free but basically by learning the aliens way of communicating thought patterlanguage the linguist actress and humanity learns a different perception of time that depicts a deterministic universe

movies,removed,i do not prejudice against dindus i do not hate them either i simply acknowledge they often times chimp out in the theaters and have no grasp on how to behave because they run wild like the fucking lost children of robin hoods sherwood forest no fathers to explain to them not to hoot and howl inside the movies if their mother works she is at work and not at home to rear and raise them the leftist culturally marxist democrats tell them they can behave how they want and criticizing them is hate speech by people with privilege yeah fucking manners and behavior privilege i do not hate them for this i do not think less of them for this and i do not treat them lesser for this but i recognize it as being a truth does that make me a racist

movies,removed,amc encourages movie torrents by charging more for blockbusters

movies,removed,its not about special seating in the theatre its about the movie industry betting the public is so stupid the we would pay more because the social buzz about movie a is more than movie b so movie a will cost more in this free society we now have to pay more based on popularity instead of quality remember this word for the future torrent fuck that
movies,removed,well theyre also gonna start charging more for torrents too x new amount
movies,removed,yeah keep giving us reasons to ever go to a theater again aside being one of the worst years for movies in recent history i have my own theater at home with better seating access to beer no fucksticks with devil spawn kids that shouldnt be in an r rated movie and a close bathroom and the ability to pause fuck you ill wait until its out on media or pirate bay

movies,removed,is it so scary to type out the word nigger
movies,removed,ds silent nigga
movies,removed,you mean hed rather use the nword instead of nigger
movies,removed,it looks like hes making fun of someone who has tourette syndrome people are laughing because the character of alf is saying extremely inappropriate things he says nigger asshole hard on repeatedly like its a tic
movies,removed,glad to see your lobotomy go well
movies,removed,the way you speak conveys your attitude and level of consideration for other people when your wife asks you if she looks fat in a dress do you answer with you look porky as shit or do you say i think youd look better in this other outfit if you were informing a family that their lovedone had been killed would you say we caught the crackhead who blew tommys brains out this morning or would you say weve apprehended the suspect who shot and killed thomas earlier today the language we choose conveys all kinds of things besides the literal content typing nword is a way of at least acknowledging the fraught history of racial injustice typing nigger without any reason or context is like saying idgaf
movies,removed,please shut the fuck up youre like the third person in this thread to make this comment already
movies,removed,he isnt white washing it saying the nword doesnt wash away the associations with it if anything it strengthens them if you want to white wash history start calling something arbitrary like dishes nigger so the history of it and its shock value fade away
movies,removed,ah yes either you type nigger or youre this person i forgot the old there are two types of people law of conservation
movies,removed,my dick is exploding guys help
movies,removed,jason momoa getting wet got me wet
movies,removed,if somebody wants to not use the word let them just not use the word theyre welcome to do whatever the hell they want but it isnt helping the cause of removing the stigma attached to nigger quite the opposite and it sure looks to me like simply whitewashing history
movies,removed,jason momoa looks fuckin basass it seems like they actually made aquaman legit
movies,removed,i seriously doubt that footage was from nigger nigger nigger
movies,removed,youre also an idiot thats exactly what it fucking means no wonder stupid movies make a billion dollars with retards like you and your up voting monkeys watching them why else is there a ship the size of the fucking moon attacking the earth its their whole fucking civilization they fucking say it im out
movies,removed,who also has a penchant for saying nigger
movies,removed,familiar with the facts and the history in the first place youd be surprised for example where did you learn about slavery grade school college ive taken upperlevel history courses where the entire class would sit up in their seats at the mention of the word nigger its like taboo i learned about slavery from faulkner they didnt have an nword back then
movies,removed,i disagree firstly context makes a word hateful or not not the word itself give a word without context that kind of significance only gives it more power in context people shouldnt be afraid to use the word nigger academically or informatively thats purely ridiculous also the black community does not give it the respect they demand of it from others hip hop songs are littered with it often in positive or brotherly ways but god forbid a white person so much as type it out neutrally online it makes no sense either call it a dead word and agree to not use it because of its negative history or allow it for anyone in a positive context its silly to say when we use it its acceptable even if were being derogatory with it but if anyone else uses it even positively then fuck them yeah it has an ugly history i get it but its still just a word and if you want to change things you cant give it double standards as silly as this may sound i think calling it a black only word only reinforces the racism surrounding it
movies,removed,boycott this shes an israeli terrorist
movies,removed,whats up with the ending that fat woman chose to be a secretary for money all jobs are slave jobs to money when you think about it im sick of this women empowerment bullshit the dumbest thing women could have ever done is fooled themselves into thinking they were oppressed
movies,removed,i know what it actually is but its widely considered a movie and its better viewed as a movie in one singular part who fucking cares if its actually an ova its a two and a half hour long work of art that isnt long enough to be a tv show pointing out such an insignificant discrepancy is worthless tape it together and its a fucking movie you cunt
movies,removed,my penis is so hard im typing this comment with it

movies,removed,and theyre saying shit like people are gonna blow this out of proportion yeah well when you call outlets who report that ben might back out and call people stupid who believe it yes now they have a reason to blow it out of proportion because theyve just been proven right while all the folks at rdccinematic called them stupid so ya think people are not gonna blow it over after all of that they were just proven right this is what happens shit how many times has this happened are wb worried about bvs only stupid people believe that and it universally wasnt loved reshoots with suicide squad because it was a mess only stupid people believe that and it critically was a failure even the dc fans admit it on this one is ben affleck stepping down as director only stupid people will believe that ben steps down as director whats funny is only the rumors that bring good news are believed by the fanboys in that sub
movies,removed,go back to rdccinematic you cuck dont you guys always cry when the mass of people here shit on your movies oh yeah because theyre not snyder cocksuckers like you guys muh deconstruction
movies,removed,that statement i heavily disagree with so i got curious and checked wikipedia from forward it looks an awful lot like terrorist incidents occurred just as often with nativeborn englishspeaking americans as legal immigrants and the number of illegal aliens that are also terrorists is surprisingly small they are two separate issues you can disagree with it all you want but youre still wrong if you actually fucking read through the page its pretty clear that the biggest and most clearly defined acts of terror are committed by immigrants or children of immigrants that are radicals sure an american killed a cop or two because they believe in the illuminati but thats not terrorism and thats not a bomb or mass shooting that killsinjures over people these people should not be here but fuck it let em in cause for whatever reason you dumb fucks think these people who dont give a fuck about you should be let into the country its just like black lives matter stand up for people that would take your shit and kill you in a second why dont people just want to keep america safe people are so afraid of offending someone or letting foreigners live in hell that they jeopardize their own safety you guys are seriously the dumbest fucks in the world

movies,removed,yeah sure people complain about lack of original movies bit when they are some they dont bother going to the theater to watch them i have a feeling that people only goes to theater if they are sure they will enjoy it and that the movie is worth enough the price they are asking for and the time it take to organize an evening out respecting schedule and so its so much more easy and cheaper to watch that new unknown movie you dont know if you will like it from netflix or worst download it in torrent to watch it comfortably in his living room on a uhd tv with surround hone theater sound system that you paid month salary and you have to make it profitable
movies,removed,fuck the cunt who thinks shaky cam is cool
movies,removed,because idiots support the ghostbusters remake not even joking theres a lot under this statement for anyone who isnt just a cuck who likes to dismiss things as stupid

movies,removed,youre allowed to dislike superhero movies and not take punctuation seriously on a bullshit messageboard website you fucking twit
movies,removed,topo he is a kraken like creature with great intelligence getting into aquaman right now is really easy he benefited greatly from a continuity reboot in if you are interested in the character look to pick up aquaman volume the trench its cheap and a fully contained story if you like it go volume volume amazing and onwards topo manta aquaman and mera all feature heavily and it will turn your previously held thoughts of aquaman on its head you can read it at comixologycom walk into any comic book store or acquire it online through a torrent if you go the latter option you can just view the downloaded files through any of the freely available comic book reader programs
movies,removed,that doesnt follow on so many levels first of all insulting someone and sounding intelligent as you do it have no relationship on the validity of your statement youre also putting yourself in a box if he did sound intelligent then his statement would be more true to begin with doesnt make sense and makes your argument even weaker than it is also you are making yourself look more stupid by responding that way and moving off topic completely to make an insult the topic was is there some sense of superhero movie fatigue instead of using your own argument and examples based on the question you simply insulted the person it makes you look retarded also intelligence of people simply because you have different taste in movies it has nothing to do with a different taste in movies its about being sick and tired of a certain type of movie you could love superhero movies and still feel fatigued by the overwhelming amount of them coming out there can also be strong arguments made for or against superhero movies that have nothing to do with different taste basically my point after all of this you are the fucking idiot and dont even know it i saw your response and wanted you to know that you not only made yourself look like a fucking idiot but you did so on so many different levels fuck you
movies,removed,
movies,removed,the trailers been out for a year its supposed to come out next year
movies,removed,sjws are freaking out that a woman in a movie isnt a mary sue
movies,removed,its not his fault hes retarded reposting and misspelling are surefire signs
movies,removed,the only reason why kuprick is praised is because he is a white man there are superior directors to him that are ignored because they are not privileged like he is and his movies should all be destroyed rather than celebrated as praising him is reminiscent of hitler
movies,removed,lol at feminists and cucks mad that batgirl didnt swoop in and kick jokers ass while blowing off batman because she dont need no man get over it ya goofs if you didnt notice the title of the movie is batman the killing joke its a movie about batman and the joker not batgirl
movies,removed,you can enjoy of the content in poe with no payment at all literally you can even trade albeit more inefficiently and participate in the economy you are not gated from any actual game content what so ever for something like dollars one time you can trade more efficiently do you really think its fair to call this a game no offense if youre autistic or something and simply cant help yourself from blowing tiny details out of proportion but its a shame to see someone who played since cb and who i bet is still enjoying the game every new and free expansion misrepresenting the game
movies,removed,is that fat sack of shit hack still complaining about shit didnt he already kill his career for this kind of petty whining
movies,removed,the abyss was briefly broadcast in back in and two different very good looking rips of that broadcast have been floating around on torrents ever since it was the theatrical cut somebody at fox had a scan done likely the first since the laserdisc in comparison of a dark shot in the two rips
movies,removed,does anyone know somewhere to watch this without having to buy actual dvdsblue rays huluamazonnetflixetc doesnt have it and i wouldnt even be able to torrent it due to the movies apparently being very heavy on subtitles and really dont want to deal with downloading subtitle files im running out of ideas
movies,removed,lightsaber to the chest that thousands of people saw coming a mile away
movies,removed,the blood runs down the wall
movies,removed,paul feeg is faggot
movies,removed,its ok ill get back at him eventually the thing is i almost forgot but when han confronted his son ben now kylo ren i was like oh shit then when kylo stabbed his dad in the chest with his light saber i was all like nooooo and i knew he was dead cause he fell down a bottomless pit and thats never good unless youre a jedi are jedi powers transmittable like an std
movies,removed,why is the word cuck shadow censored on rpolitics and i message that mod that simple question on accounts never got an answer or acknowledgement that it is shadowbanned just muted every time you europeans shouldnt be modding an american political subreddit
movies,removed,are you retarded what kind of money do you expect a sequel to make
movies,removed,haha yep youre retarded
movies,removed,whilst we still need a bluray release the movie was cleaned up and broadcast in hd a few years ago available on torrent if you look hard enough great movie
movies,removed,probably a feminist
movies,removed,
movies,removed,get over it fag
movies,removed,the feminists who wrote him into a nonrole model who dies probably wanted to take him out too why the fuck would you ruin han solos reputation and kill him when hes one of the only og characters who can still pull off his role well
movies,removed,jesus christ shut the fuck up you piece of shit i guess youre a natural spielberg arent you youre a fucking insect with nothing better to do then to go on your computer and rip people apart on the internet maybe suck in your gut and try talking to a girl and getting laid that usually loosens people up safe to say thats probably why youre so butt hurt you make me sick thats not how you critique someone you fucking retard that was just being a fucking asshole do us a favor and fuck off
movies,removed,good try bud to bad i was on lunch break on my phone checking out reddit plus i didnt go on to find someone to rip apart i stood up for a stranger get the fuck outta town
movies,removed,i think its quite interesting that they removed a plot line which would really flesh out a character and possibly change people reception to him a stiffler with a struggling relationship with his father isnt quite as funny especially when you think of how similar to his father he is having his dad be a misogyist and overall dickhead with an anger problem can go a long way to explaining stifflers behaviour and attitude and it makes me feel bad for him
movies,removed,keep on fucking yourself champ im sure everybody loves being in your life
movies,removed,theres a scene in empire of the sun where little kid christian bale reaches up to touch a fighter plane the sparks lighting the scene behind him is beautiful

movies,removed,comment
movies,removed,my nigga
movies,removed,well the first one sucked so i am not sure why they are making another one other than to appease the losers on reddit who praise the shitty film
movies,removed,my goodness you are a fucking moron slap yourself in the face please
movies,removed,it isntt his mom dipshit
movies,removed,i saw this post coming from a mile always some fucking idiot literally looking to have his preconceived notions confirmed no matter the validity of the source
movies,removed,the movie theater i work at sold tickets for this movie we also sold out of both showings of the purge and of the tarzans the other tarzan sold about half way down
movies,removed,shoo shoo evil jew jew
movies,removed,so this is that doom movie ive heard so much about
movies,removed,its a classic i like that they reference classic literature and pitts character calls dante a faggot
movies,removed,nigga its a tv show obviously its not going to look like a cinematic masterpiece
movies,removed,so does he get the bfg early or does he have to fight with the super shotgun and chaingun for a little while to earn it
movies,removed,yes it was bad and roald dahl was an antisemite so their intentions were to take his tale and turn it into a strange kind of expose on pedowood hollywood is notorious for pedophilia and used the giants as a thin metaphor bringing the queen into it was the cherry on top if you look at britains horrible history of child abuse jimmy saville etc
movies,removed,the purge takes place a week after donald trump is elected president
movies,removed,shut the fuck up bitch ass reddit ass nigga
movies,removed,a few years ago i downloaded the original trilogy off of a very reputable pay torrent site and this part came on and i was so confused and thought it was some kind of troll torrent or something and deleted the file then i looked into it and realized somehow this is an actual thing
movies,removed,yes it did happen they announced it but quickly pulled it when they faced severe public backlash fucking autist
movies,removed,heres one of many sources if you are too stupid to comprehend this i hope you know how to tie a noose
movies,removed,with a stupid niggardly bastard have fun with a mountain of debt loser oh wait your parents probably held your hand through adult education didnt they
movies,removed,question havent seen the movie but does bfg really stand for big fucking giant
movies,removed,big fuckin guy
movies,removed,the purge always felt to me like somebody in hollywood stumbled upon shirley jacksons short story the lottery and decided theyd discovered something mindblowing
movies,removed,youre retarded mate
movies,removed,itll make less money in the us because of it too i didnt pay to see star wars because of it i pirated that shit on purpose

movies,removed,the fuck theres a new tarzan movie whats it about
movies,removed,i always stop right before flagg is killed in a really stupid way baby spiderthing no flagg would not go down that way he should have been at the tower to fight the gunslinger also when king shows up as a character the best series ever became fanfic crap so sad
movies,removed,lets put a pin in the doom references its not nearly as funny as everyone thinks it is when they post it
movies,removed,jews use religion as a smokescreen they are a raceone that hates humanity they play the eternal victimso no one thinks of them as the perpetrator
movies,removed,here is a very detailed over view
movies,removed,i have not seen the movie but my take so far is that the car away losses his grip on reality and comes back at the end
movies,removed,does bfg stand for big fucking giant
movies,removed,theres no shame in acquiring the original editions in questionable ways my saying on that kind of topic is that if i cant acquire something through normal means then its time to break out the torrent i own the full bluray collection so for me its legal but i wont frown upon others if they arent forking over bucks to watch og star wars legally
movies,removed,surely disney knows what bfg means
movies,removed,also it doesnt matter what the context is if you hate one movie with a female cast for reasons you ignore for a movie with a male cast or even if youre just trying to be edgy sexism is sexism again you imagine things that arent happening sorry i just assumed you like most redditors only used one account that being the rules and all of course you can break the rules but theres also the strong possibility youre just going ive totally been here a long time you just dont know and youre full of shit it doesnt matter the point is if you cant see recurring patterns on this website you havent been here long enough holy shit why the fuck do you think the age of my account means anything do you think karma is related to iq youre retarded youre also very wrong from the reddit faq is it okay to create multiple accounts yes you can create multiplethrowaway accounts as long as you do not do so to ghost vote your own submissions uh which movie is that oh my god have you even watched the trailers for the movie you are so desperate to defend clearly not because its ghostbusters the one we are discussing or that jokes tend to fall flat in trailers and its generally hard for comedies to get their strenghts across oh im sure the funny hat will be truly hilarious in the movie it just screams unfullfilled potential keep hearing this attitude that ghostbusters was subtle and deep and i have no idea where its coming from the first movies subtlety extended to mostlikely improvised quips bill murray made the rest of cgi ghosts sliming people giving dan akroyd wet dreams and filling nyc with sludge i collect spores molds and fungus dropping off or picking up the fact that venkman carries enough sedative to knock out a large animal on a date where do these stairs go they go up nothing in those trailers even comes close venkmans sliming happens off screen and then the reaction to it is funny not a ghost straight up vomiting slime followed by a rant about how hard it was to clean up they are not the same basically you are defending trailers you havent even seen dragging insane off topic matters like account age up as if they matter and every claim you have made is utterly unsubstantiated
movies,removed,its either gonna be the stereotypical asian whore role that serves as a plaything for some white character or maybe tilda swinton
movies,removed,mako mori was a fantastic character no she wasnt her role was the typical cringe role for an asian woman shes the stereotypical geishaasian whore role she does kung fu and serves as a whore to some white character before you watched the movie you could map out exactly what her role was do kung fu and fuck some white guy thats the stereotypical role for an asian woman in movies
movies,removed,it would have worked if it was funny somehow i must admit im curious about the movie now and im going to watch it assuming anyone has an actual torrent for it
movies,removed,her role wasnt prominent her role was the stereotypical geishaasian whore to some white character its pretty much the only role for an asian woman in hollywood think about it out of roles of an asian woman in filmtv is serving as some white guys whore its getting to be cringeworthy
movies,removed,thats really not how i interpreted mako at all its not for interpretation its what it was its formulaic its the stereotypical cringeworthy role like i said before you even watched the movie you could map out what her role was if anything she has more motivation than raleigh who is talking about motivation im just talking about stereotypical formulaic role by the end of the movie the peephole scene is basically a forgotten nonsequitur you are making a lot of rationalizations and excuses it is the stereotypical geishaasian whore role they tried their best not to make it as obvious as it is in other films but thats what it was thats the template they used and they just added fluff here and took some obvious cringe out there but at the end of the day its the cringeworthy stereotypical role its because these movies are written by the same type of white trash and it is greenlit by the same type of white trash i was hoping that china would create their own film industry but it looks like they are just going to buy into and copy hollywood the main character in pacific rim was the white character raleigh mako is just the typical geishaasian whore for the white character
movies,removed,join the pirate bay its free
movies,removed,so they are reporting on it just not reporting on it like you would like them to got it you complaing about them not going into detail or depth but those are just short clips they uploaded to youtube ive been watching a lot of cnn and theyve been discussing it a lot thats just all i can prove to you with links because thats all they posted to their channel
movies,removed,because fuck you
movies,removed,maybe this is just me but i actually couldnt but then you described her character to a t i dont see how you can say motivation isnt important when talking about stereotypical female characters in action movies because motivation has nothing to do with the stereotypical asian whore character one of their biggest stereotypes is that theyre only motivated to serve the male hero which was not the case here no the stereotype is that the asian whore serves to serve the white male hero and that is her role the main character is the white character the supporting role is the black character her role is a cheesy story asian whore for fucks sakes her role was to serve and save the white character hero it was dumb and along with the newtons cradle scene its one of my two most its not just the peephole scene its the entire character its hollywood its the creepy white rats writing these scripts its the creepy white rats greenlighting these movies its simply a function on the type of scum running hollywood its history its formulaic boring stale characters its racism and the eternal asian whore role the mako character is in many was the cringiest asian whore role when you think about it
movies,removed,i have to go seed some torrents
movies,removed,please put s tag always as a service to the of reddit who are on the autism spectrum
movies,removed,you can disagree all you want but it is what it is her entire role in the movie was to serve and save the main white character did you even watch the fucking movie all that fluff about her backstory is just formulaic fluff like i said if she wasnt the stereotypical asian whore role they would have made that role a japanese man but hollywood doesnt like giving many roles to asians in general and asian men in particular so they made it the stereotypical asian whore role she had her own backstory motivation and goals unrelated to the white guys and yet her sole purpose in the fucking film it turned out was to serve and save the white lead per stereotypical asian whore role you just seem to think that since it was pg and she wasnt giving him a dolla sucky sucky that her role was less asian whore you are so fixated on the superficial because you are desperate for it to be a certain way but her role is the cringiest asian whore role in a long time and you can downvote me all you want it doesnt change the nature of the role maybe you are some loser weaboo white trash and you refuse to see it for what it is but that was her role
movies,removed,they work together the whole movie the main character was raleigh the entire movie was center on his character he was the hero the supporting character was stacker she was a supporting character at best and her role was primarily that of an asian whore her role was a supporting role to the heromain characterprotagonist of the movie and she isnt serving him theyre helping each other to accomplish their own individual goals god you are so fucking stupid and desperate you are the obvious typical worthless weaboo trash they dont even kiss that would be pretty pg still fixated on the superficial you can play the asian whore role without ever kissing reddit is so full of little dick weaboo white trash fuck off you dumb shit
movies,removed,in taylor released her fifth album shake if off is the lead single and features a departure from swifts earlier country pop musical style i think its her undisputed masterpiece a song so catchy most people probably dont listen to the lyrics but they should because it is not just about the pleasures of being a dumb whore but about conforming to stereotypes and trends it is also a personal statement about her feuds with kanye hey paul fuck the kardashians and all their nigger boyfriends

movies,removed,jordan your a fucking pussy
movies,removed,it blows my mind that they are only of the total population in the us
movies,removed,they have admitted it
movies,removed,what are you talking about according to reddit the white male is the most oppressed group in history his life and career can be ruined by false rape accusations peeing in public taking pictures of his kids in the park being white etc
movies,removed,i think the fact that he was maybe is im not sure a raging alcoholic and is bipolar and a huge insurance risk that people didnt want to take on also helped get him blackballed just a thought
movies,removed,but damnit dont you ever mention the bullet proof sons of abraham when tasked with explaining my failures in life i can always point a finger at the livejournal post i made containing the damning phrase jews did
movies,removed,he managed to piss off a wide variety of interest groups in an impressively short amount of time as a dude who loves to show a hint of his pussy from behind this specific rant soured me on mel
movies,removed,ah cabin in the woods the movie every male redditor saw when they were and it just blew their little minds without realizing its a fucking terrible movie

movies,removed,youre truly not a smart woman are you like to have to actually lie because you didnt like something is so low i dont even know how to respond to it its beyond petty pathetic childlike nonsense
movies,removed,lmao did you somehow forget the part where gibson admitted to beating a woman and threatening to kill her
movies,removed,i didnt see that on entourage
movies,removed,im not a spammer dont accuse people for no reason you cocksucker
movies,removed,ok what if biology class gave them a dopamine response what if writing papers gave them a dopamine response and videos games did not then what idiot do they still have adhd what if they are getting straight as because they get dopamine from school and they cant focus on video games because they get no reward is that adhd you fucking retard youre going to have to respond yes by the way
movies,removed,lol lets see who do have that says you are wrong well so far everyone that made the original comic and everyone who made the movie but you still say no because most likely a shitty cracked article you read which now makes you an expert honest question what does it feel like to be this embarrassing

movies,removed,im at month and going downnnnnn brasil
movies,removed,napoleon dynamite is my favorite movie and i am big fan of this movie
movies,removed,loved it was so shocked when ryan gosling died minutes in
movies,removed,something vilified by the community such as the way the advocates of homosexuality once were are still political even if despised most transgenders paedophiles and other various weirdos would agree
movies,removed,and soon hillary will join them
movies,removed,op delivered still a faggot
movies,removed,i dont think my comment history is exactly secret so if you feel like youre blowing the lid off of some big expose hate to disappoint you but im quite open about my opposition to jewish power
movies,removed,homosexuals were once vilified for their political opinion that they had rights paedophiles and trannies as hated as they are have the political opinion to say that their sick desires are somehow normal i dont see how this is any different
movies,removed,no just that people like mel gibson who have relatively unpopular opinions are like the homosexualists of yesteryear marginalised until their political opinions broke through to the mainstream sometime around the death of rock hudson
movies,removed,yes you might say blaming jews for all the wars in the world is a bit strong if youre a
movies,removed,disclosure im an open antisemite who agrees with a lot of mel gibson and gibson seniors worldview disclosure im politically conservative and would sometimes be described as farright i dont know how this negates anything i said however mel gibson is still entitled to his political opinion that jews run the world just as i am entitled to it
movies,removed,not really i would become a hipster if it ever became that cool and disown it as one of the original progenitors only to condemn everyone who now believes in what i believed
movies,removed,not really im just trying to discover what motivates some people to literally see a paedophile as better than someone with unpopular political opinions i think what youre doing is called projecting
movies,removed,of course i do lovely woman that she is
movies,removed,not bad
movies,removed,mel gibson is a bigot he is a prevatican catholic that blames the death of christ on the jews and appears to believe in the jews run the world conspiracy this is not a political statement in fact it is a political statement as well as a religious one the way you phrased your statement
movies,removed,the only real paedophiles i can think of from that era were jim morrison and donovan both musiciansbut i was born long after that so perhaps im being myopic due to my age
movies,removed,cant imagine why hed think the pianist wasnt good because its the same boring story told over and over ad nauseum for the last years holocaust movies are unoriginal to the point that even a jew like mel brooks said enough was enough
movies,removed,whats unfortunate is that the op had a good point to make but chose to weaken it by lying in such a lazy and selfserving way by saying gibson was punished for speaking his mind about some political issues regarding jewish representation in hollywood rather than what he actually said which was that fucking jews are responsible for all wars hollywood does have a history of forgiving people whove victimized young women and they most certainly did not extend that quality of forgiveness toward mel gibson after his racist tirades its a doublestandard and its helpful to point that out for instance iirc zach galifinakis threatened to quit one of the hangover sequels if mel gibson was cast in a rumored cameowhich makes one wonder why he had no problem with convicted rapist mike tysons participation in the trilogy but op decided that path was a bit too dangerous to tread and retreated to the safety of boring old lies what a cuck
movies,removed,yeah youre entitled to your opinion and mel is entitled to his literally nobody is arguing otherwise others are also entitled to call you idiots and refuse to do business with you so the crux of my argument is why would hollywood refuse to do business with someone like mel while openly advocating for the repatriation of a paedophile back to the us
movies,removed,and thats why i dont give a fuck about tv movies or any other faggot shit they lie
movies,removed,
movies,removed,im going to torrent it but not watch it just to give them a scapegoat

movies,removed,black knight nigger in the new world
movies,removed,adywans cgi is as good as and often better than the se cgi which isnt saying much but still in my opinion adyways additions bring episode much more into line with the rest of the original trilogy you can respect a film and still try to make it better i dont know how you could read his list of changes most of which have nothing to do with cgi in terms of color correction and fixing continuity and not see someone extremely dedicated to and respectful of the film anyway there are two versions adywan made and the change log i linked previously notes which changes are in which versions pal and ntsc versions with new fx purist edition which includes only his edits for things like picture sound and continuity errors which is still an enormous list
movies,removed,hes being sarcastic you asshat
movies,removed,get disney movies for
movies,removed,op is fag
movies,removed,while i am tired of superhero movies i do agree with your sentiment if its a good mcu movie then by all means make it i guess im more sick of the torrent of superhero movies and tv shows of every single randomass comic character that ever had a couple comics some of which just seem to be there to make some quick dough as you mentioned im all for quality franchises god knows i love me some star wars but i wish that we could have a good franchise without all the filler dreck in the same genre as insert successful franchise here that is just there to make money
movies,removed,cheating but better call saul

movies,removed,spoiler he gets the medal of honor
movies,removed,mexican standoffs or showdowns mexican standoffs were like lets take this outside moments in westerns you cant just have the protagonist and antagonist give chase to one another and have them stare at each other while pointing guns at each others faces feet away from one another theyre not dueling for honor like in some western you just shot of his henchmen back there why the fuck are you not lighting him the fuck up theres not even some plot armor component theres literally no reason not to shoot him that goes for him too why the fuck does he not just shoot wtf whatever the little maxilla muscles in my eyes were sore from the fucking amount of mexican standoffshowdown scenes on taken andor they make no fucking sense

movies,removed,way to project asshole i wasnt trying to be condescending at all its not a superiorinferior dichotomy its a matter of personal taste in this case based on ops particular criticisms thats the conclusion i drew its certainly no flaw to dislike a popular or criticallypraised movie but i do take issue with the assumption that its overrated just because he doesnt like it not everything is for everyone and people should learn to differentiate between personal enjoyment of something and its objective worth
movies,removed,
movies,removed,wow so i just want to tell everyone that umendaciousracist raped me as a victim of rape i need to be believe unequivocally i expect he will be banned from this community immediately otherwise youre all rape apologists

movies,removed,
movies,removed,the amount of blood on the ground in far from lethal it didnt reveal anything other than her possibly getting a taste of revenge she could easily die in the next scene

movies,removed,this shit was turning me on bdsm shit and then wtf this girl is crazy okay id like to teach her some manners but this guy is an idiot why didnt he put her in a straitjacket or tied down all fours where she is literally a pet if you have their arms and legs folded and then bound she would only be able to move around with her knees and elbows she would be an actual dog she would be able to extend her arms and legs she cant use her hands id put a metal ring gag in her mouth so she cant bite my dick and ill stick a buttplug and a huge vibrator stuff it in her ass and pussy when theyre not being used and she cant pull them out id also still a inch long dildo in her mouth when im not using her mouth so she would be filledin in all holes when shes alone in the cage when shes hungry id slide a thick feeding tube down her throat and feed her dog food and piss id superglue wireless earbuds in her ears and seal any noise from the outside and all she can hear is a recording of me saying you are now my slave when she disobeys me ill use my shock collar to make her be quiet or better yet itll shock her if she screams ill have her hanging on suspensions most of the time and use her as fuck puppet and clamp a bunch of electro shockers all over her tits and body maybe its time to give her holes to good use and invite my creepy friends salad fingers and pbear to triple penetrate her no mercy ill make her realize shes not crazy i will make her wish she could back to living a normal life but i wont let her i will show her pictures of her family and make her breakdown in tears until year from now ive completely broken her and she now loves me and is nothing but a toy
movies,removed,so let me get this straight you claim that i didnt watch the film because it was the company no my brain dead friend you are wrong i didnt bother watching it because based on the many trailers and clips a year old could notice the piss poor writing and unoriginal story its a movie that the producers thought could be saved by a semicredible cast you are blind and ignorant just like the man if i can call him that you are defending its the fact an uncultured person can express his enthusiasm about this sorry excuse for a film is why cinema is dying in the first place people like you and assass lover over here dont know the first thing about cinema your taste or lack there of is insulting to people who truly know what movies are about if you and stupid ass over here call yourselves film fans than me and anyone with any taste dont want to be a part of it the mere fact you defend this movie shows your lack of any capabilities to learn the first fucking thing about the art its a shame this is what this world has come to you are a joke like your father mother and everyone you is was before you im sure youll get that because just based off of what you typed your favorite movies must be star wars you pathetic knowitall your reply to my comment is just like the original post meaningless and and lack substance your words are empty i guess you pimple faced retards all think alike huh do the world a favor and stop commenting your shit taste only strengthens the incompetent trash the comes out of hollywood it is not i that cannot comprehend an idea it is you that cannot wrap your head around the concept of quality films stay a tasteless cunt and leave this site

movies,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvigaixsbaba
movies,removed,torrents
movies,removed,try kat pb demonoid yadayadayada
movies,removed,exactly my thought went to amazon and searched for release nope checked local theaters nope torrent site hell yeah download started
movies,removed,from what ive read online the torrent version is an incomplete version of the movie chopping several scenes
movies,removed,spoiler if i remember correctly godzilla tries to take over the world and getting rid of humanity the way he did that is by self replicating and splicing the skeletons are the smaller version of godzilla
movies,removed,id torrent this but i can only find webrips this needs to be seen in imax and at the very least at home such a shame
movies,removed,
movies,removed,cough yoho pirate bay for me but bought it straight away
movies,removed,this one is my favourite though
movies,removed,honestly i have been trying to find a pirated copy ever since i saw it in theaters a few months ago and havent been able to find it dont see it on torrent sites and trying to stream it on kodi just keeps getting me either the or american films
movies,removed,minutes and the line didnt budge i have a job i know how to get things done i also know what its like to work with people who dont know how to get anything done and thats what i see nearly every time i go to the movie theater im venting online its not like i went to the boss and got someone fired people are so concerned about their fancy seats that they wont go to see a film with the plebs in regular chairs and all im saying is to shake a leg i dont mind waiting in line and i would sit on the floor if it was the only option but that movie is going to start on time and it sure would be nice to have a snack and not miss the opening scene its something that is so simple to fix and the vast majority of movie theaters around here need to work on it
movies,removed,my theater does this as well and its about for a matinee and for a regular showing
movies,removed,it is not on torrent so its not released yet
movies,removed,me and a friend of mine had some major confusion regarding this movie i told him how much the previous godzilla movie sucked the one with brian cranston but he thought i was talking about this one he yelled at me and called me a stupid faggot i was so confused

movies,removed,the author brooks barnes is a race baiting liberal puke
movies,removed,just waiting for a subbed version to hit the torrents
movies,removed,hit up to watch it with subtitles not a porn site
movies,removed,i saw the theatrical cut and rewatched the compiled camrip many times it was uncut as far as i can tell thats the version that american critics said could use some shortening and i recall reading that funimation was considering cuts thats not the cut on torrent sites i was talking about the version on torrent sites which looks like its been ripped from an official source has restylized subtitles is minutes shorter without anything to suggest accidental scene loss like an encoding glitch suggesting that scenes were professionally and intentionally removed and it was released by two separate sources with the exact same scenes missing and pirate groups arent in the business of editing out scenes in new releases additionally the theatrical release subbed the spoken english while the ripped version leaves it unsubbed i dont have any sources saying that the american dvdbd release will have cut scenes but the evidence makes me believe that the rips are from the unreleased american dvdbd release which would hint at the release having those cuts
movies,removed,oh fuck off mate
movies,removed,if thats your opinion why even bother commenting pig fuck

movies,removed,women just arent very good at anything movies included
movies,removed,id honestly rather show up here every day to different youtube clips posted by various people reminiscing about some old movies because then theres lots of clips to watch id much rather this kind of thread instead of all the text posts of great movie actually has bad cinematography and terrible movie actually has great cinematography threads you know the ones where all the neckbeards prove what great filmmakers they could be by taking the counter stance to the consensus opinion of a movie sorry i meant film
movies,removed,not cinema but that legendary shot of alexandra daddario in true detective
movies,removed,this i mean fucks sakes marvel is the worst right now lets have female thor female wolverine asian hulk black spiderman and they all say its great and diverse i see it as were too lazy to come up with decent characters or write people of different genders and races so lets just have them ride the coattails of successful heroes that in reality will never be as well known or remember because they arent their own characters theyre just riding on the legacy of others like for fucks sakes agent carter is great because she was her own woman in the and what not she was a badass and her own character thats why shes so memorable christ people get your shit together over this diversity shit
movies,removed,why does everything popular that you dont like need to start pandering to you retards it went really well with the comics hahaha
movies,removed,it upsets me that someone with no background on the subject thinks their personal politics should run roughshod over a character and story thats been built up over decades and anyone who disagrees is an idiot go fuck yourself

movies,removed,clint eastwood is not racist and the message in gran torino is not that its cool to be racist i dont understand how anyone can think thats the message of the film hes been and is prochoice progay marriage against the war in korea vietnam iraq and afghanistan supported womens rights groups is in favour of stricter gun control and is an atheist what he wants though is less goverment hes a social liberal and a fiscal conservative and hes a hardass with little patience for whining to put it like that he comes from the generation that fought in and where you could call black people niggers in polite company without anyone batting an eyelid he might be inclined to think that its pussy behaviour to be upset because someone misgendered you or over this or that microaggression
movies,removed,i mean bernie sanders is older than donald trump but i guess he doesnt count because hes a cuck

movies,removed,stupid little gay pussy
movies,removed,not exactly its about how other people hear the phrase and whats commonly associated with the phrase historically colored has been used to refer to secondclass citizens bathrooms seats water fountains etc so a person can say oh yes hes the nice colored young man in accounting and itll be nonhostile but because of context the person listening will think oh this persons old fashioned in terms of race relations so youre right that it all does literally mean the same thing its why nonenglish speakers may refer to someone as nigger without meaning anything bad but language does have cultural and historical context which is why we differentiate between person of color and colored person
movies,removed,damn im over here still waiting on tom hanks to star in the last nigga on earth
movies,removed,why
movies,removed,and i dont disagree with that by changing terms to something more positive were allowing the ones who use it negatively to own the word there are some movements where groups of people are trying to take back the word which is why many blacks use nigga as something endearing but that leads to another problem where some people cant use that word because of that groups background and historical association with the word its a weirdly complicated matter because it all works off assumptions other people will make
movies,removed,but have you seen those movies

movies,removed,it was so fucking awkward growing up back in my day kids had pagers and sold drugs through the schools payphone i cannot imagine the hell the teenage years must be like with social media i would want to shoot up the school instead of face that hell httpsislimghdnwzkjpg
movies,removed,drive had a lot of occult jewish symbolism involved with it
movies,removed,if you want people to calm down stop spreading hatred men arent giving poor reviews to ghostbusters because they are bigoted against women they are giving it poor reviews because it is an greedy bastardisation of their childhoods im glad we were able to come full circle so maybe this time you can get it through your headif louis ck and jim norton remade sisterhood of the traveling pants and instead of whatever kind of comedy was in the original they just filled it with scat jokes fans of the original would be outraged even if their reboot was funny as shit to a new audience the girls that grew up with the wholesome version have every right to not like it without being labeled sexists jesus stop drinking the regressive left koolaid and grow a fucking pair

movies,removed,please try to upvote the positive reviews as they are being spammed with downvotes
movies,removed,sorry this is not a good family film this film tells boys that they are either evil or inept i refuse to let my son watch this
movies,removed,serious question if they called it ghostbusters and everyone who cameoed played their original characters and maybe had larger plot lines would it have been better the team disbands sometime in the due to the death of egon and the government proceeds to cover up that the team existedwhich is something that gets referenced by the mayor peter searches for egon but eventually gives up and proceeds to convince himself that none of it was real anyway and he becomes a skeptic ray quits to become a cab driver winston cant seem to escape working with the dead and becomes a funeral director the team never reassembles and needs to be replaced kevin could have even been renamed oscar
movies,removed,once the decision was made to go with all female leads this movie had the kiss of death planted on its forehead nothing could have saved it the original ghostbusters was a buddy movie hello women cant be buddies thats a guy thing
movies,removed,good one lol
movies,removed,the meme frog and the feels scorpion
movies,removed,niggas forgot about first knight
movies,removed,movie was horrible the black chick is the most retarded and annoying movie character ive seen literally the only good thing about the movie was my man thor i rate
movies,removed,shit post drops mic
movies,removed,unenthusiastic i hate witch hunt how hard respect other opinion
movies,removed,i cant believe people are downvoting positive reviews here how petty can you get
movies,removed,im downvoting retards who complain about downvoting like you
movies,removed,my opinion of ghostbusters is same as my opinions of the robocop and total recall remakes reboots theyre bland films that dont come anywhere close to matching the classics upon which they were based the thing that surprises me is how boring all these remakes are i did not expect them to be masterpieces like the originals i would have been fine if any at least made me feel as though the i spent on a ticket was justified but they were all boring to me thats the worst thing a movie can be especially when its got a production budget of million another thing i find interesting is that with the robocop and total recall remakes there was nothing remotely similar to the shit storm that ghostbusters elicited like gb the other two were remakes of beloved scifi classics yet unlike gb relatively few people complained and most people simply chose to ignore it the newer robocop and total recall came and went with barely a whimper yet ghostbusters has an army of trolls going after it go figure
movies,removed,for one han solo is not a captain he is a smuggler with his own ship he does not command a crew he has a partener and the greatest ever is bill adama picard is fag always want to talk and not take action kirk just wants to fuck and mel is just a poor loser suffering from ptsd bill adama is responsable for the entire human race
movies,removed,eyeroll you could do a reverse image search and see its not out there anywhere enjoy the movie el diablo dies at the end by sacrificing himself while fighting enchantresses brother so they can win oh wait spoiler alert play stupid games win stupid prizes
movies,removed,okay i know its easy to be skeptical about positive reviews but dont just downvote people for positive reviews
movies,removed,i really want her to call roland a honky mahfah faggot boy having idris elba play the role actually helps make it more feasable in a major motion picture hes black so itll tone down the racial discomfort and odettadetta do have hallucinations so she could see him as secretly white or something
movies,removed,add torrents too
movies,removed,this is the reboot our culture sadly deserves picked on ghostbusters low self esteem a villain with even lower self esteem and of course much more hype than hilarity heres my full review its from a conservative perspective
movies,removed,what did your wifes son think
movies,removed,so your saying its ok to degrade men you want your son watching this growing up thinking that women are powerful but men are inept and evil more power to you i guess
movies,removed,lol still boycotting this movie and yet people are watching it still wow
movies,removed,hey why wasnt the villain female getting shot in the tits or do you only like it when theirs violence against men
movies,removed,its almost as if people were holding this movie to a different standard just because it has women in it why are you going out of your way to support violence against men why do you think its ok that all the men in the movie are either idiots or evil you want to push the girl power narrative at least push the girls can be evil or dumb narritive also dont be a hypocrite
movies,removed,shhh theres an agenda to be pushed
movies,removed,honestly i am going to be going through and marking down the reviewers who said this movie was great just to thumb their noses at a small contingent of misogynists who werent gonna see the movie anyway they staked their reputations on this shit movie and now having seen it myself its become quite clear that they only gave it a decent review to piss off the actual woman haters and let down the general public umm but if youve a working brain and any kind of taste for movies youll be regretting okay you definitely have not seen the movie and if you have seen it youre clearly another biased orangutan you complete loser
movies,removed,how the fuck was this certified fresh jesus christ rotten tomatoes is on the pay roll or something
movies,removed,
movies,removed,man hating nonsense the rating it gets on imdb speaks for itself nevermind the reviews people must be getting paid off
movies,removed,in this day and age you have to be really careful not to offend anybody i understand why he had to say that
movies,removed,in a jimmy kimmel interview with the cast of ghostbusters melissa mccarthy argues that men on the internet who dislike the movie do so because they dont want female ghostbusters while i believe that the majority of people dont dislike the movie for this reason im taking a survey to see what men on the internet actually think the link to the google form is below thanks
movies,removed,its reminiscent of the original teaser for the movie
movies,removed,just wait for the torrent
movies,removed,how does such a mediocre film and thats being generous have a on rt
movies,removed,honestly if you havent seen the original dont comment
movies,removed,i would like to say that as a very loyal fan of the original film i found this movie to be literally nothing at all adherent to any of its established themes the reboot is primarily focused on the characters as in they are a group of funny women who happen to be ghostbusters it isnt driven by any sort of plot undertone or mystery the humor is extremely flat derivative and predictable i found it an offense to the original and a waste of time and money any positive review here is coming from someone who didnt see the original or a shill
movies,removed,word is that the new trailer features a darth vader appearance

movies,removed,its true this movie has no dick

movies,removed,ugliest part thats an exxageration the united states only had slavery for years before we did away with this multithousand year tradition at great cost of financial wellbeing and cost of life we then spent every decade since trying our hardest to improve the lives of black americans through countless social programs job training education food programs welfare and free housing all at tremendous cost and still after all that we still have black on white racial riots this isnt working anymore we have the worst race relations in decades right now so dont you tell me how wonderful it is to keep it fresh and hot in everyones mind
movies,removed,do you still blame modern germans for the wiemar republic and rise of national socialism if you do then shame if you blame modern white americans for slavery almost years later then shame on you
movies,removed,but we are blamed every single day and you know we are dont be obtuse

movies,removed,are you fucking retarded ive literally addressed all of those points have you forgotten everything already white people arent the only ones who reviewed it for one it also includes many accounts from native americans at that time and today white people are not afraid to admit what we did wrong we openly admit how awful we once were but this whole argument came out of your inability to understand of native american deaths came from unintended deaths from disease fuck you for your racist drivel literally discrediting work and history just because of peoples race and fuck you for trying to pin guilt on current day white people who didnt do shit to hurt you you either accept history with facts and peer review or you live in ignorance it seems youve already made your decision

movies,removed,ben hurr didnt make shit it bombed and if you didnt remotely like bvs then you must not be a fan of the genre or charactersyou dont have to like it and im no dc fan boy but to say it wasnt remotely good shows your ignorance on a critical stand point the score the cinematography the actors performances both supporting and main cast definitely werent something to scoff at was it phenominal absolutely not but was it a good movie of the genre a resounding yes i love how people always side with critics in the hope that they will come off as more introspective and wise as a movie goer if bvs didnt do it for you then you couldnt possibly have liked any of the marvel movies and thats a damn shame too because despite thier rather bloated extended universe out of are solid movies in the genre fuck outta here
movies,removed,i know this sub is incredibly skewed towards certain films and that theres a circlejerk having been present for many such films since the beginning of the sub and i imagine that jurassic world is part of such a circlejerk but i cant be the only one who thoroughly did not enjoy this movie it was extremely bland and forgettable as such id hope that not too many people are excited over this sequel

movies,removed,and really a guy that hates people is black hearted wow i had know idea great in depth analysis really digging deep there god your retarded
movies,removed,so to quote the movie the person you are quoting must be the icon of the film are we talking iconic characters or quotes lol that was the dumbest thing you could have said to strengthen your argument my favorite quotes from tarantino movies are his lines and hes always the smallest part i dont want you to tell me how good the coffee is julian im the one who buys it i know how good it is when bonnie goes shopping she buys shit but you know whats on my mind right now it aint the coffee its the dead nigger in my garage so now if thats the quote someone gives you youre saying its because quentin tarantino is the icon your a fucking idiot dude

movies,removed,i had the opposite happen at least once watching buffy the vampire slayer the movie on tv i thought for sure theyd edited a bunch of stuff out because the movie seemed so choppy seriously like there were whole scenes missing or chunks of scenes turns out thats actually just how the movie is i dont remember ever having a situation like youve described but i like laughing at movies edited for tv after seeing them elsewhere theyre so awkward some times especially these days they dont seem to bother with editing over dialogue instead they just silence it so itll be like oh yeah well youre a huge complete silence where its supposed to say faggot or something

movies,removed,american gangster
movies,removed,arrival i can see why it has a on rotten tomatoes because it is truly a workout for your entire brain and possibly the best science fiction movie about linguistics ever made having said that i believe this movie will fall to an on rotten tomatoes there were some notsosubtle nods to a space odyssey in the first scene spoiler alert where they go up into the spacecraft and then by the end of the movie it felt almost as if this was some sort of looselytethered remake of so many elements borrowed from the plot to the cinematography to the set design then there were the aliens octupus knucklespiders that shoot circular sentences out of ink i really wish i had eaten some mushrooms or dropped some acid before watching this movie as it is i was really stoned but unfortunately not as stoned as i could have been i had totally forgotten i had bought a ticket and was wandering through a target when i suddenly realized the movie was about to start so i had to rush to the theater on foot without being able to burn one where was i oh yeah this movie was beyond trippy and if i had been on mushrooms it wouldve affected me to my core and i wouldve been the last person to leave my seat after watching all the credits in tears unfortunately i was not on mushrooms and the circular ink kinda looked like random splatter they shouldve made it more fractally also i didnt really care about her cancer daughter and the whole subplot about how knowing how to read knucklepod makes you see your own future this movie was way too good at being cerebral to try and tug at my heartstrings too sorry didnt get emotionally invested in the daughter or empathize with the main characters choice to have the same doomed child when she could just have sex at literally any other point in time and have a different sperm cell impregnate her seems a little fucked up not some beautiful decision that merits a kronos quartet suite
movies,removed,arrival i was completely blown away i cant find one flaw with this movie as soon as it ended i wanted to see it again definitely my favorite of the year so far and one of the favorites of all time

movies,removed,arrival the movie that everyone is raving about this week its rare that a movie lives up to the hype i built in my own mind being a big fan of the story its based on i was excited to see they were adapting it im happy they handled the material with such grace and gave it its own flair id say more but theres comments in the discussion thread that support my feelings doctor strange marvel knows how to make a fun movie i really enjoyed cumberbatch and ejiofor tilda swinton almost always annoys me but i even enjoyed her in this role the visuals were cool the story was fun its certainly not a masterpiece but the lady and i had a blast enemy i had to watch it again after seeing arrival and while it still confuses me to no end gyllenhaal puts on a great show

movies,removed,i like strangling young girls and licking their cute nipples and pussies while the life fades out of them eye contact makes it even better
movies,removed,so at one point i did a really quick read through of all reviews linked on rotten tomatoes in order to figure which reviews were heavily biased i was looking for keywords such as misogony manbabies girl power angry nerds things of that ilk of those reviews i found that reviews showed pro feminist bias and gave a positive review reviews gave a positive review with no bias reviews gave a negative review in other words if you omit the biased reviews that are pushing an agenda you are looking at a rt ranking of about this number is more inline with what the top critics have rated it basically it seems that alot of people are invested in this movie being awesome just to push an agenda even in this thread you have guys like ushakespeareanrumba making up stories about how he defended the movies honor to a trump supporter its ridiculous the amount of love this movie is getting from certain segments of the population based on their political agenda

movies,removed,i told everyone to pirate those two movies am i in the wrong
movies,removed,shut the fuck up
movies,removed,i just gave a horse a blowjob while getting anal from a goddamn elephant
movies,removed,the movie has never been about gender it has always been the social warriors that have shouted that people who dislike ghostbusters are some how sexist misogynists rather than refute the claim that ghostbusters was a lazy reboot with no love for the original material critics of this movie were silenced by ways of calling their opinions sexist and antifeminist furthermore feminist bloggers argued that people should see ghostbusters for no other reason than to support women even if the movie was terrible gender politics was forced into this debate otherwise ghostbusters receive no more harsh criticism than total recll and robocop both of which were lazy summer reboots of once loved movie but no one was called online commentors sexists when they said it was stupid to have total recall only on earth or to have robocop be in a total black suit and remove the inherent social commentary that verhoeven put into all his films
movies,removed,kate mckinnon is in it ive always liked him
movies,removed,considering roland has the horn of eld im pretty sure this adaptation is exactly what we all wanted after reading the last paragraph in book what i took away from the end is that its a cycle that is constantly repeating but roland will change small things each time around until he eventually gets it right or make it to the tower with his katet intact
movies,removed,yeah and hes super badass and then gets eaten by a baby spider fuck the last three dt books in the asshole rawdog
movies,removed,oh he was responding to someone thats fine then hes mad that he got called a fag growing up boo hoo
movies,removed,can roland not wear the costume its too faggy
movies,removed,what if i were to tell you that there was also a vocal portion of womenand even some men on the internet right now that going out of their way to destory anything that has to do with masculinity your little victim argument would fall apart wouldnt well you dont have to look very far its a pretty mainstream liberal ideology now
movies,removed,nigga you aint got to delete shit fuck the haters
movies,removed,no its not dude you nor the author even checked what happened any of these other shitty reboots youre just claiming that theres more men then women because guess what ghostbusters had a predominantly male fanbase to begin with girls didnt grow up begging to put this shit in the vcr they we watching clueless amd shit with james vanderbeek male movie buffsnerds in general outnumber female ones a dozen to one there is nothing wrong with that just dont act like men are going out of their way more than women because i guarandamntee you if you at real critic demographics for release that have nothing with a feminist social justice war there will be even less women per capita reviews
movies,removed,she seems like shed be a fun person i loved her and eugene levy in this movie together and fred willard of course but hes always great he voiced the inadvertently racist teacher on the boondocks that called riley a nigga
movies,removed,pot meet kettle right my agenda is to not watch the movie due to it looking like shit based on the previews my agenda is also to point out that alot of the good reviews arent really that good more so than watch it bc guuuurl powwwwer now before you go calling me a misosoup note that there are plenty of movies with women leads that i love for example aliens franchise tomb raider resident evil element terminator these are movies that are awesome in my opinion and have a woman lead in what is a tradionally male genre and i know you wont believe me but i also like clueless mean girls legally blond and miss congeniality yes these are guilty pleasures of mine ghostbusters i didnt like i saw the trailers and they were offputting people made the point that you cant judge it without watching it so i watched it torrent as i did not want to waste money on what i judged the trailers to be and you know what it was bad now we have all these reviews that are basically watch it not because its good but because feminism dont politicize a bad movie and expect people to fall in line to watch to support some cause
movies,removed,it came out on torrent sites last week bluray quality

movies,removed,ultimate cuck
movies,removed,hang on because i said people would look at your opinion differently what exactly did i say about it not a fucking thing stop weaseling yourself out of this you know damn well what you meant you dont want to be confrontational and you felt the need to criticize my criticism of the song because you were offended by it yes you were offended by it admit it admit that you felt the need to defend how others would also be offended by it but you wont do that because that is what triggered sjw will do lets break it down social justice warrior you are fighting for other people warrior for equality social justice you want to see yourself as the proud knight defending some faceless group you couldnt just say yeah i would have worded it differently but you make a valid point or even i dont think he sounds like that at all i think it sounds beautiful nope you weasal out of it you want to say i am offended but you need to direct that offense elsewhere because you dont want to be confrontational oh boofuckinghoo i used the word faggot in its negative connotation of the worst kind of homosexual who cries and moans and makes himself sound like an effeminate bitch because you know what those kind of homosexuals are worthy of my derision and thats exactly why i used the word stop being a fucking pussy if you want to say something then say it take a position otherwise stfu

movies,removed,i doubt it gregor is essentially a zombie how can a zombie maintain an erection he could use a weapon to commit the act but i cant see it especially after the shit that the show got after the jaimecersei scene at joffs funeral gregor when he was alive killed several wives during fits of rage but never had any children from any of them and its said that he suffers with excruciating headaches likely because of illness which may be the reason for his massive size too personally i dont think hes interested in sex and maybe he killed his wives for their infidelity hes a really violent individual and cersei said to septa unella that she would die but not for a long time i think its more likely that gregor was left to treat her how cersei was treated shave her possible deglove her skin starve her and mutilate her until she dies

movies,removed,sir anthony hopkins and jodie foster in the silence of the lambs fun fact gene wilder was originally supposed to play the role of hannibal lecter in that film however two days before shooting began wilder was struck by lightning oh what a terrible day he recalled years later in his autobiography coffee tea or gene i was golfing in palm springs around the hole i noticed some clouds coming in my golfing buddy said maybe we should head back to the clubhouse i said no way sting weve got and a plate of hot wings riding on this game and i intend to collect hey you think we should get out from under this tree but before he could answer whammo a giant bolt of lightning struck me right in the temple he continued i was in a coma for seven weeks very peaceful in there i saw my old dog and my recently deceased gilda she told me that in the year i would finally win my oscar it didnt happen so either she was terrible at predictions or i should have made a movie that year anyhow i woke up from the coma and who was sitting by my bedside with a plate of wings a coors light and ten bucks yep sting he cried and then i punched him in the arm and called him a girls name twenty minutes later we left the hospital and played a round of golf meanwhile producers scrambled to find a replacement for wilder luckily sir anthony hopkins was available and the rest is movie history

movies,removed,streaming is still illegal if your workplaces it department is competent and hr or management are predisposed to minimising legal liability then there is a good chance that both the work computer and internet connections will be monitored and you could possibly be caught and reprimanded for using illegal and nonwork related websites the method ive stated minimises the risk of this occurring by using your own and unmonitored computer and by connecting to the websites through a vpn which encrypts and masks outbound and inbound traffic to your computer through to another server not under the jurisdiction of your workplace or isp my first comment related specifically to workplaces but most streams are also crap compared to torrents so theres no point in using them under my methods

movies,removed,warner bros will eviscerate it in editing and ruin any semblance of a plot or story to turn it into an action movie just like you said they wont take a risk on a franchise this weird they wont give toho full creative control if they say they are giving full creative control its a mutually beneficial lie warner bros wouldnt even give full creative control to david ayer during the making of suicide squad a franchise that could never fail based on edgy teenagers love of both the joker and harely quinn the guaranteed hot topic commercial revenue would be more then enough to profit they will not have faith in an anime as goofy as jojo warner bros have been destroying art since eyes wide shut stanley kubrick died just days after handing the final cut to wb kubrick had no history of heart disease in his family and was very healthy prior to his passing he died only days after submitting the first cut of the film to warner bros at this point the film was commandeered by warner brothers and heavily edited they claimed it was to cover up a few seconds of sex scenes and yet tom cruise nicole kidman and others who worked intimately on the film claim that anywhere between to minutes were cut there are peculiar memory holes in the internet regarding the original run time of the film toms characters reaction towards the end makes no sense considering what he just saw essentially turned out to be a rich swingers orge club there are surviving story boards from the film which depicted ritualistic sacrifices with masonic symbols everywhere ones you would see at bohemian grove there is also evidence that the original plot alluded to child sex rings with nicole kidmans character being one of those children brought up to be a sex slave the original ending cut also clearly shows their daughter being kidnapped while they are busy being indulged in their own relationship stanley kubrick was notorious for having controversial subject matter through out his entire career just reference one of his daughters tweets she is defending her father against faked moon landing conspiracy theorist my fathers artist works are his unimpeachable defense surely after nearly a absence from film making he clearly came back for a reason to tell his fellow citizens something very important it wasnt to give us a romantic drama romp as the sociopaths at warner bros tried to market it as just go ahead and compare the tones of their trailer to the one and only teaser that kubrick cut for the showest convention his only marketing for the film and httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuwqseopboc pretty fucking different eh the last time he ever spoke on camera was while accepting the dw griffith award he speaks on dw griffith taking risks and revealing controversial subject matter httpchildabuserecoverycomnicolekidmansfatherdiesamidpedophilechildmurderringallegations did kubrick choose nicole kidman for more then her acting ability was he giving her an open platform to expose something with him we wont ever know besides the executives dismantled kubricks film in editing kubrick managed to show both nicole kidman and tom cruise his final cut of the film more then likely confirming that they are okay with going ahead with his final cut and kubrick was notoriously known as a perfectionist of an editor and it was not uncommon for him to edit his movies literally the day before his deadline he had a very distinct editing style and as someone who is obsessed with his films to me it is obviously not his edit even as a child before i had any insight into the morbid reality of what occurs on our planet i knew something was off about this film kubrick had the rights to a final cut on each and every one of his movies except for one eyes wide shut eyes wide shut is a masonic saying i am blind to your sins as you are to mine in other words i trust you because we see one anothers misdeeds its those in power doing horrible things in front of each other and filming it essentially for mutual black mail that is what is being portrayed at the end of the film is a depiction of one of aforementioned black mail parties where they would not only commit terribly illegal acts but also do homoerotic things on film since so many of them couldnt be more disgraced if something like that came out to the public now do you get why nixon said what happens at the bohemian grove was now even if warner brothers wasnt directly responsible for kubricks death i do believe they showed his final cut of the film to some very powerful people then merely turned a blind eye as they were too preoccupied by butchering his final film into something they could market more easily as not to lose any profit while at the same time spitting in kubricks face considering there was nothing he despised more then romantic comedy romps at some point i hope for the sake of the future of cinema that warner bros goes bankrupt although that wont happen as long as they have bailout buddies in the banking system as you see they are very integrated into american society so much so that their earliest films were all propaganda a lot of which are now considered missing or lost look on the bright side though guys if the illuminati if you wanna call them that killed stanley kubrick for what he originally wanted to unveil then that means his final film lives forever in a meta third wall breaking way he couldve never even hoped for or perhaps he knew exactly how close he was flying to the sun and thought maybe his charred remains would shake some truth out of a system built on lies corrupt politicians evil ruthless business practice power strugglespower trading and well money kubrick may have just overestimated the awareness of the people and underestimated how satiated we are in our ignorance we may never see kubricks intended final cut maybe it exists out there somewhere could be sitting in someone very powerfuls personal theater perhaps their hubris wouldnt allow for them to destroy something so rare but we must ask ourselves if it did unveil some dark secret and showed the people some semblance of truth would it change anything i like to think it would remember everyone dont be afraid to fly too close to the sun just forget the wax feathers and do a better job on the wings

movies,removed,tired of pfc doss being celebrated for being a conscientious objector if youre enlisted youre part of the killing team to pretend that you dont contribute to the kill just because you didnt pull the trigger is about as hypocritical as a mob boss saying hes innocent because he didnt pull the trigger of the hit he ordered participation is killing just because you want to absolve yourself from accountability on some legal technicality to appease your conscience is the ultimate hypocrisy
movies,removed,i wonder if he celebrated by telling his ex he hopes she gets raped by a pack of niggersfor the second time
movies,removed,he wasnt talking about all black people he was talking about niggers which is only the most criminal minded lowest just like we talk about white trash once people say it is a word for all black people that becomes a problem that was not how he used it
movies,removed,he already apologized for their underhanded ways and their hook noses relax hes a good goy
movies,removed,piratebay plus utorrent will get you what you want
movies,removed,fucking weebs
movies,removed,you really dont see anything racist about saying that since his wife dresses in a provacative way she going to get gangraped by a pack of n he wasnt drunk btw also if you listen to the recording it wasnt a fightit was him screaming at her over nonsense i dont know how you dont find that statement offensive im white and not a sjw either and i find that statement disgusting
movies,removed,is not rape in france not in in it was legal in france to sleep with a year old and polanski is polishfrench and i never ever heard someone calling drunk sex in france rape never every sex i ever had in my life was with drunk chicks or chicks on drugs am i a rapist by your fucking standards
movies,removed,so the women i sleep wityh are pieces of shit too by your standards since were usually both drunk drugged is not legally a child in it was legal no the legal age is of course i would sleep with a year old girl if i had the occasion its crazy to pretend otherwise were meant to be aroused by youth and its idiotic to pretend otherwise puritanism aside if the legalk age is you might as well have sex with yeard old and why do having anal sex make it worse unless from a strictly puritan point of view youre just a sad moralist clenching on traditional dying values the bible is behind us old man get on with the times
movies,removed,i hope you get raped by a pack of niggers mel gibson
movies,removed,i hope you get raped by a pack of niggers mel gibson
movies,removed,ive been in that place and ive said some shit maybe not raped by a pack of niggers but honestly i wouldve if it had come to my mind
movies,removed,everybody agrees rape is wrong we dont agree on whats rape obviously i think i speak in the name of all french people when i say we dont have a problem with sex sex is great lets stop the criminalisation of sexuality no police in the bedroom please
movies,removed,i believe in second chances mel gibson blew his shot at a second chance when he told his exwife that he hoped that she got raped by a pack of niggers
movies,removed,i was only arguing that in france it would have been legal even with the drug since weve never heard of your fucking date rape bullshit which proves that we have more liberty and less morality police here in france than over there i wasnt arguing that what he did was not illegal on america on the contrary but everything is illegal in america when it comes to sexuality even sodomy was illegal up until ten years ago in many states so backwards litterally
movies,removed,i like hopper went to watch not on netflix prime is and torrent only had one seed for a file darn
movies,removed,wb shooting itself on the foot warner is inadvertently trying to make it harder for the public to find links to legitimate content which runs counter to its intentions said ernesto van der sar from torrent freak
movies,removed,dude i have fucked more kids you could ever dreamed of this has nothing to do with i was a teacher if he put the drug without her knowledge then yes it is bad but i was under the impression that she was taking drugs on her own accords from what i know she was some kind of lolita adult material model or something not some pure angel that was kidnapped from a playground i have always heard that everyone at that party was taking drugs
movies,removed,nigger nigger bitch cunt jews they are just words get over it
movies,removed,you are a puritanic piece of shit eat a bible you asshole fuck you your quran or whatever holy book and your rules
movies,removed,whos talking about ghandi heres a truncated list of despicable things mel gibson has said on record i will report her to the fucking people that take fucking money from the wetbacks you look like a fucking pig in heat and if you get raped by a pack of niggers it will be your fault i am going to come and burn the fucking house down but you will blow me first fucking jews the jews are responsible for all the wars in the world are you a jew i want to kill himi want his intestines on a stick i want to kill his dog so yeah fuck mel gibson
movies,removed,is legal in france why would i be on a list my exgrilfriend was im fuck everyone that that bothers perfectly legal grat relationship best body and best sex i ever had
movies,removed,because secretly dosing someone with a drug without their consent is completely the same thing as two adults having a few drinks at a bar and then having a one night stand

movies,removed,its blatantly anti art to reject a work because of external factors i understand that you reject that but its true
movies,removed,im pretty amused to see it getting buried over something completely unrelated selfhating white liberals wanted a black experience™ movie to fawn over soooooo badly and they picked one that turned out to be directed by a rapist ha
movies,removed,have you ever even kissed a girl
movies,removed,yes that is the question isnt it perhaps its because she has a thousand voices whispering in her ear that she is oppressed and men are trying to keep her down and eventually she starts to believe them
movies,removed,this movie was very predictable and i loved it the story was put together nicely and both jennifer and chris did a phenomenal job of portraying the situation they were in i thoroughly enjoyed the graphics the storyline and the ending definitely a movie worth seeing wwwtopmoviestech
movies,removed,rot in hell you worthless cocksucker fuck your mother
movies,removed,slit your wrists you deserve to be boiled in piss
movies,removed,i dont know whats wrong with these stupid critics i saw it at a private screening and jesus this thing was a masterpiece citizen kane of video game movies i actually also got a girls number from this movie too she was an ac superfan so i may be going over for a date to her house and play some ac on sunday she was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo hot so this movie was both amazing and will no longer make me a virgin on saturday fingers crossed
movies,removed,i disagree with that guess which it is because hopkins is clearly way way more slim in the flashback than what he actually is today they obviously used another actor and did the same thing as in rogue one this was also never an argument about which was more difficult so
movies,removed,i had planned on watching it
movies,removed,might be a torrent you could burn onto a dvd
movies,removed,and yet jews control the banking system that sends gentiles off to war for profits needs a star of david not a swastica
movies,removed,
movies,removed,its actually not that bad considering the way the movie ended one cannot think of any other better way to end such a scifi movie as thatyou can check out this movie and see if youd like it httpslimetubetotvshowslucifer dunno if you had actually seen it
movies,removed,so one guy just decided he wanted those two terms to mean different things and therefore they now mean different thingsthats not how it works also i dont know how the second one applies to me at all since i said nothing about marvel or dc movies i offered no opinion so here is a quote that i found that refers specifically to you youre retarded
movies,removed,
movies,removed,as soon as i heard that lame rap song in the trailer i was pretty sure this was going to be bad i was unfortunately right
movies,removed,wow a great movie this retarded subreddit doesnt have a hate circlejerk for im genuinely surprised you fucking faggots

movies,removed,muslims have earned all the hate they receive all by themselves did amish fly planes into buildings do amish mass murder or rape or acid attack women nope all muslim i dont fear islam i reject it irejectislam
movies,removed,haha well said my nigs
movies,removed,unnecessary is that because islam is a religion of peace and theyre mostly all peaceful except for the majority of them that hold radical beliefs is it because we shouldnt know why this happened is it because the backlash on the suuuuuper peaceful muslim community wouldnt be nice oh nooooo maybe they should stop blowing shit up every day and using high capacity assault trucks to kill innocent people thats just my opinion though
movies,removed,pussies expect you now
movies,removed,predictable video games movies are always awful yet peopke kept hyping and anticipating this project the last months when will they learn

movies,removed,its funny how the internet is literally the only place i see hardcore liberals and im from a state that usually votes democrat but allot of democrats arent liberal just older people who think democratic views are as centralized as they were years ago they dont realize how far left the mainstream democratic views have gone but yea i rarely run into you hardcore liberals in real life just on the internet and of course of the media you guys are so brainwashed its sad now that you have read this comment and your little brain is starting to think of all the responses you could make just take a second to realize how fucked in the head you are
movies,removed,no thanks paris is full of muslims and french people if i want to smell that id simply not bathe for a few weeks place hasnt been nice since it was german
movies,removed,hey fucktard look at the older tsarnaev in my link the autopsy one post torture he died in fbi custody they tortured him to death thats chainsaw and blunt force bruising his cousin died in fbi custody too nothing to see here fuck you traitor maga incoming
movies,removed,nsfl look at the older tsarnaevs autopsy photo go ahead thats blunt force trauma and chainsaw injuries he died in fbi custody so did his cousin zero words of testimony from tsarnaev since etted off boat a completely wrong medical application he did not require an ett tube it was used to gag him wake up people shill accounts active here personas running on reddit you think they threw hundreds of millions of dollars at organized propaganda shilling because its fun disinformation keeps you asleep
movies,removed,you cant respond to one fact huh namecalling is all you got fuck off shill account explain fbi killing tsarnaev and his cousin in custody crickets
movies,removed,yeah he was pretty awesome i kind of wish marvel would have tapped him for something a bit bigger than that role thoughspoiler alert since he died at the end of the film i think he could really bring a bit more gravitas to any role he plays maybe even replace brolin for galactus

movies,removed,whores wait you now
movies,removed,i know its gonna suck harder than you do with a mouthful of cock faggot
movies,removed,i agree the film has us watch an ambush on an imperial tank in the middle of jedha city and gives us just the tiniest look at the ramifications of insurgent warfare the girl crying and asks us to believe that gerraras tactics are too extreme its one example its completely out of the blue and it didnt pack any sort of emotional punch at all though i would also say that i feel that way about the whole movie also what kind of power does gerrara hold it seems like his fortification is nothing more than a hole in the side of a cliff with a detachment of twenty or so gooks and a leftenant with a rebreather does that constitute too extreme or just a shitty insurgent cell honestly looking back at the worldbuilding here is just making me angry so ill stop
movies,removed,all outdoors saw your sister therein such a hooker

movies,removed,you act like women can just pack on muscle like men can and you fail to forget that most of these hollywood actors who put on mass amounts of muscle in a very short period of time are doing so with peds you think a woman is going to pump herself full of test just so she can look a bit more muscular for a role

movies,removed,i wouldnt downplay hitlers ability to orate neither would i pay for a hitler audiobook the theft argument lies separate because films in particular are a collaborative effort i may not want to buy a film to avoid putting money in one individuals pocket perhaps i also dont want to steal the film on behalf of the several hundred other talents involved in making it all purely hypothetical though i torrent movies all the time aint hypocrisy something
movies,removed,see that second blu rey menu you said is the example to follow its fucking seconds too long why the fuck would i want to wait though a menu when one of the points of owning the film is you get to see it when you want without the stuff around it if i paid for a disc i dont want trailers i dont want menus i dont want coming soon paying for a film is in my mind a way of getting to see the film without hassle the torrent is harder to get but once you have the file its clic film im paying to not have to torrent hassle not get extra crap

movies,removed,we know the cast is drastically different from the original show that was enough for me to lose all interest before the blue arrows start rolling in someone explain to me exactly how the of the actors skin colors matching their suits was racist and none of that well the creators were known assholes just ask the guy who played billy and all that every week each and every character got the same amount of lines screen time and fight scenes no one was greater than any of the others except when tommy showed up but even he was nerfed down to the others level and everyone contributed all that wash with the black and yellow rangers having suits matching their skin may have been an odd choice of a joke but ive never understood how its ever been racist

movies,removed,obi wan that rebel scum
movies,removed,are you under the impression that rose mcgowan is viewing this thread because i certainly am not and attack really now i hardly think that something so insignificant as a post by someone ive never met probably never will meet am probably thousands and thousands of miles away from on an internet forum or whatever youd call reddit which i could easily stop looking at or even close with the single click of a button should be considered an attack on that person as a wise man once said nigga just walk away from the screen
movies,removed,i love the soundtrack to this reminds me a bit of dj bede
movies,removed,i think dj bede would be perfect to do the music in this
movies,removed,i was raped do you have any evidence of this you asking for evidence is proof i was raped
movies,removed,no i think that because they are words its not an attack see in the world of grown ups words only hurt when you let them dont worry champ im sure youll understand when youre older
movies,removed,someone combined all three into one feature length film cutting out all the horrid parts i tried to find it but every link i follow is blocked due to copyright
movies,removed,sad little boy name calling how very juvenile of you
movies,removed,great soundtrack in the movie i think dj bede could have complimented it in some scenes though
movies,removed,an observation you say well lets see here based on my observation of you id say the exact same thing about you youre a sad little boy you overly sensitive and overly protective of women probably a mommas boy probably a child of divorce youve probably lived a very sheltered life which would explain why youre so shocked by something as inconsequential as message board posts in fact im willing to bet the reason youve taken so much time to continue this argument is because you still live with your mother and you feel personally insult for her oh and you are awfully presumptuous about my opinion of women just because im skeptical of a movie stars twitter rape claims
movies,removed,decent into name calling you mean when i called her a bitch because that was my first post in the thread i dont know if you understand what a descent is but more importantly you felt the need to deconstruct my observations on you which were very clearly based on nothing more than our back and forth but went a step further in an attempt to validate yourself by going through my comment and post history i think thats pretty funny you pretend to know how i think and what my beliefs are based on the postings of an account that cant be more than several months old on message board that i didnt even visit until a year ago even if i were youd be basing your entire opinion about me and the way i think on what a single digit percentage of my entire life no not even because i dont believe it or not spend all of my time on the internet so youve become so into this argument that youve decided you know me based on pretty much nothing at all
movies,removed,wet boobs expect you here

movies,removed,tense kitty await your buddy get her now
movies,removed,hm interesting i gave you an exit a pretty good one i thought but gosh darn it you just cant give up well now rage hm which of us seems to be filled with rage well on the one hand i referred to a woman as a bitch once on the other hand youve called me sad a little boy impotent youve said that i have no friends that i live with my parents and that girls dont look at me you seem pretty angry might want to look into it
movies,removed,you know what the term impotent rage means right well you know im not sure i do let me go look it up ok lets see here its the phenomenon many men seem to suffer from when they are powerless in a maddening situation and have nowhere to direct their anger reason and good judgment melts away giving way to unparalleled stubbornness stubbornness hmmm thats sounds familiar lets take a look a little bit before that part though now a normal person would probably have hung up and called right back or even tried again later but not me no siree i was in a fullblown fit of what i have come to call impotent rage oh now that sounds very familiar sort of like how youve been sitting their in front of your family sister cutting your glorious mane while arguing with a person youve already called troll in what youve already called a pointless conversation now why would you still be doing that perhaps it is that you are experiencing impotent rage
movies,removed,those rebel scums
movies,removed,maybe but i loved the sound track in that i hope he includes some dj bede next time
movies,removed,rape is a terrible life shattering thing no one should be they male or female should ever have to endure such a thing my issue is when you see people online talking about how a woman changing her mind about consensual sex after the fact somehow constitutes rape those kind of accusations only serve to harm real rape survivors thats my problem
movies,removed,were actually all laughing at you youve been entertainment so you have that going for you oh bravo youve begun regurgitating lines ive already said to you an hour ago how about a bet i bet you cant walk away from this conversation without having the last word see the fun thing about this bet is that i win either way because either i get the last word or you lose the bet because you cant stop replying like the desperate little child you are
movies,removed,youre like the ultimate troll please you give me too much credit i had such an exemplary rube to play off of how do people like you get through the day after logging off and joining society well first i remember that none of what transpired actually mattered and then i probably forget the whole thing ever happened
movies,removed,how dare you call this movie an american movie when its mostly funded by china and meant for the chinese market because it is produced by white people and written by white people the movie was produced by thomas tull charles roven jon jashni peter loehr it was written by carlo bernard doug miro tony gilroy story by max brooks edward zwick marshall herskovitz not a single chinese name if you are chinese you should feel ashamed im not but if you are then you should feel ashamed what a fucking idiot not everything is so american centric you know did i say it was i suggest you come and visit china sometime no interest in visiting china sorry
movies,removed,wow dude just consider for a second that im actually a person with a middling interest in reddit spend most of my internet time on gearslutz who is a professional and has a child i actually spend time with rather than neglecting for sake of my reddit addiction i feel bad that your family has you oh and by the way no matter how much you try and distract yourself with the illusion that im actually the alt of the other guy you were arguin with still doesng change the fact that you are an absolute loset who neglects spending time with his family to post literally hundreds of comments a day to reddit how many comments you going to post today have fun redditing today when my son gets up from his nap we are going out for a hike and i probably wont be back until monday so make your reply a good one on monday when i see it and am reminded of your sad existence ill look through your history to see how many hours total you wasted this weekend then ill laugh
movies,removed,according to your comment history youre not a good parent not cute
movies,removed,people not being raped is not just their cause but their cause isnt ours rape as far as im concerned is when you rape someone when you force them into sex the definition of rape is constantly stretched and diluted by people trying to push an agenda if anything thats what the real rape culture is pretending there is a rape culture
movies,removed,can we just get an angry mob together and rape paul feig or maybe just burn his hat and cane collection
movies,removed,why do asians need to break into hollywood cant you have your own separate asian market you could simply move back to your homeland and get involved in movies there why do minorities feel so entitled to invade white peoples culture
movies,removed,try again
movies,removed,what a faggot
movies,removed,reallyare you telling me chinese movies have a dalai lama inspired main character eventhough china hates him so then why did they keep the character and give the role to a white woman wouldnt that piss the chinese authorities even more you jackass having a white woman play the character allows for china to not ban the movie are you fucking retarded if they were concerned about being banned they would have cut out the character entirely you dumb shit
movies,removed,the movie fucking sucked thats the reason it flopped it wasnt any good people recommend movies they read reviews if the general consensus is that the movie is awful people wont waste their money and time i read the poor reviews and stayed far away found a torrent a few weeks ago and turned off when thor made everyone stand in some awkward position i couldnt take it any more it started pretty good though first minutes
movies,removed,yeah im sure you played a huge part in that building of america huh youre probably some white trash retard from south of the mason dixon riddled with incestuous defects completely analogous in worth to those minorities whom you denigrate you mouth breathing cuckold cant wait to see your fas lookin ass face cause your year old alcoholic and methods addled mother couldnt be bothered to pretend to want to carry to term
movies,removed,oh the guy who made the aids drug so expensive def not watching his movie
movies,removed,the problem is this with asian leads al you forgot the hollywood had a longstanding racist policy of not hiring asians or other minorities western distributors wont show films with al because western audiences wont watch films with al thats the same argument used against black actors white people wont watch blacks in movies and therefore blacks shouldnt get lead roles in movies it took the civil rights movement and lot of fighting back that allowed black leads like denzel washington will smith etc to get that chance it was a concerted effort by hollywood to introduce black actors into movies that got people to watch people watch what you tell them to watch hollywood dictates taste not the people that waiting for another crouching tiger hidden dragon to produce the next generation of asian leads what asian leads did crouching tiger hidden dragon produce the problem is systematic there are a cabal of white men who control hollywood the only roles they allow for asian males is the geekloser and the only role for asian women are white mans whore pretty much any time you see an asian male on the screen is that of a geeknerd whenever you see an asian woman on the screen is as a white mans whore whether its tv or film netflix or disney its a systematic problem
movies,removed,to some of these folks karma is life
movies,removed,the character was going to get the movie banned if they had followed the original ancient one concept which was a dalai lama inspired sorcerer in appearance and role it is still the same fucking character you fucking retard that is the point they didnt get rid of the fuckign character and no it wasnt going to be banned you dumb jackass she is a celtic sorceror shes a celtick tibetan buddhist monk kung fu sorceror give me a fucking break is that why they made her look like a tibetan monk you fucking retard they removed the taboo parts of her character which were old stereotypical asian sorceror mentor what dalai lama inspired monk related parts of the ancient one it is the same fucking character you miserable little rat im not exactly sure why your so rude and insulting me but what makes me a whitewashed asian trash because you are one
movies,removed,marvelous stuff anus that girl can do with her
movies,removed,before the there was no indefinite mass immigration from noneuropean countries because there were racist laws to prevent asian immigration httpsenwikipediaorgwikichineseexclusionact asians werent immigrating in large numbers but neither were arabs or anyone else yes they were who the fuck do you think built the railroads who the fuck do you think built the chinatowns asians were coming in large numbers and thats why laws were created to ban them lot of japanese and chinese american had their property stolen and were forcefully deported why are you only thinking in terms of asian people because the topic is about asians so why the fuck are we expecting them to be a major part of the cultural mainstream if theyre a very small percentage of the country major who the fuck is talking about major im talking about giving asian american actors parts to asian fucking roles you fucking retard my point is why are white people getting asian roles like emma stone like tilda swinton etc so get a fucking clue about us and hollywood history before talking about shit that you dont understand

movies,removed,oh yeah visual rape lmfao doesnt exist and her trying to pull that shit hurts actual victims she is the same bitch who two decades ago went on the red carpet as close to naked as she could get away with and now she is claiming walking down the red carpet is akin to rape lol she is nothing more than a washed up b level actress that is now trying to get herself back out there and relevant by any means the fact that you feel the need to defend this washed up bitch would be funny if you werent so pathetic
movies,removed,normal sorry im not some things skinned whining loser like yourself yeah it is horrible to be able to take a joke and not constantly get pissy and whiny over shit said on the internet
movies,removed,i dont need help thats the point quit white knighting like everyone needs help we dont
movies,removed,lol you keep projecting you know nothing about me and assume things based on your own failings doesnt surprise me your constant whining pushed everyone away thats why you spend all day every day on reddit
movies,removed,seeing as my daughters are doing great in school im financially secure where i never have to work and do whatever i want it cant really get any better i want for nothing thats your projecting again
movies,removed,todays been a great day took my daughters out to eat and met up with a couple of my friends and were going out tonight to hit up the bar to play some pool your life must really suck with how you are projecting all this at me
movies,removed,what are you so frustrated that my life is better than yours even with all your white knighting wah wah why is my life so shitty i protect people on the internet that you cant even make sense anymore
movies,removed,no shit today has been great i just got back from going out to eat with my daughters and friends not to mention while killing time i can annoy a whiny bitch like yourself just by being happy and doing me

movies,removed,some twat posts the xkcd comic with its smug and selfrighteous contrarianism idiocracy will be seen as the most prescient and forwardlooking movie of this generation but unfortunately nobody in future generations will know what prescient means because only fags say shit like that

movies,removed,it wasnt a single comment moron if youre just going to live in delusion and ignore the blatantly obvious im not going to waste anymore time on you

movies,removed,oh and my favorite freak you sam rothstein freak youuuu

movies,removed,star wars the last jedi
movies,removed,shut up you bellend
movies,removed,wow another faggot leftist doing weird shit who wouldve guessed
movies,removed,hmm on rt it says httpwwwrottentomatoescommwarcraft
movies,removed,as much as a jerk this guys being hes kinda right a lot of fanboys in various warcraft threads were downvoting negative opinions this is basically going to be a smaller scale bvs shitshow
movies,removed,this was also the case with max payne and it failed miserably in fact the movie surprisingly added more fantasy and surrealism than was called for
movies,removed,you realize a on rt would mean that half of critics liked it to some degree right man review aggregator sites are killing critical discussion i have no opinion on the film as i havent seen it yet but in what way would saying of people liked it and of people didnt so im right make sense critics play an important role in fostering more thought and discussion in art but im sure everyone who has seen enough movies has had multiple instances where they are in that or or enjoy what you enjoy and make your case for or against something dont adopt others opinions as validation or replacement for your own
movies,removed,out of the seven us reviews so far of them are extremely negative a lot of points brought up in those specific reviews come off as completely biased and invalidated them in my eyes not to mention that these us reviews are breaking the embargo also all i have seen on this sub regarding the movie up to release is that it will be shit and the cgi looks like shit etc so i think its fair to say that the majority of stuff on this sub about the movie so far has been negative and comes off as people wanting it to be bad so they see it as bad personally idgaf about these reviews because the embargo breaks next week and i will see where the reviews are at then
movies,removed,yes critics want movies to be bad so they would have to waste time watching bad movies your logic is flawless actually critics have talked before that they do prefer movies to be bad as the articles get clicked on and read more than if the movie is well received critics have admitted that they try and find political issues or offensivesensitive material where it really doesnt exist see zootopia and angry birds reviews because it creates a lot of buzz and views the reviews we have seen so far have compared the movie to the current political landscape in america referenced american racial tensions and talked about donald trump
movies,removed,you must be a nonwhite blind to the fact that you live in a great country built by whites ask yourself if youd go back to one of your nigger countries and youd probably be too scared
movies,removed,lol so i should ignore all the absolutely insane and unneeded political comparisons and just focus solely on the parts that sound like a pretentious review saying warcraft is reminiscent of lotr or game of thrones just shows that this reviewer sees all fantasy type mediums the same those two things have so little in common besides the fact that they are in the fantasy genre to compare warcraft to them just because its a fantasy setting just shows this reviewer has a bias towards anything in said genre they cant even judge the movie on its own the whole review just compares it to other things from game of thrones to donald trumps campaign so the part of the review about the movie was actually just comparing it to three other series also a movie doesnt need to be heavy in star power to be good this review is hilariously bad and trying to defend it even funnier
movies,removed,i believe that the good reviews will come in foreign critics loved the movie french audiences have it a standing ovation i wholeheartedly believe that good reviews will come in when the embargo breaks
movies,removed,exotic yeahhi dont even think youd get yellowfever guys to believe that lie they called lucy lu exotic too i still found her repulsive
movies,removed,i dont understand what hollywood has to do with what i find attractive i just cant see the appeal its humorous how offended and defensive you got over it though
movies,removed,youre right i made a mistake by starting that backandforth nonsense i got a little too cocky there i stand by my original comment though also cmon dude throwing the juvenile insults at me i may have been immature there but not that immature
movies,removed,you cant help but be a cuck thats okay

movies,removed,was the movie ever really good was it supposed to be good in the way that movies are normally good no the people who love it seem more interested in dressing up and acting weird than enjoying the film itself well yeah thats what is whats good about rhps the paticipatory stuff that developed around it its always been a fun thing for the weirdos and freaks and art fags to do and as a weirdo in my own way though never really someone that was into the rhps i mean weirdos freaks and art fags in the best way possible where they didnt have to worry about being judged for who they are in fact being a weirdo freak or an art fag has kind of always been encouraged there its a movie about letting your freak flag fly where the freaks can actually go and fly their flags and in some of the less enlightened places in the country especially in the late and in a preinternet world where those spaces could be incredibly hard to find that was a really important thing
movies,removed,no it wasnt people who use cringe are generally year olds or the same retards who spam savage all the time either explain why or simply shut the fuck up
movies,removed,well like i said if you didnt like the first one you sure as hell wont like the second i did though
movies,removed,well i went in with low expectations based on what id read and actually thought it was pretty good you might like it just dont get your hopes up too high speaking of too high you cannot be too high for this film p thats if you can get it ive found seeds and about leeches over different torrents
movies,removed,how is it that you need help pulling out your credit card and going to netflixcom is a lot easier than posting a question on rmovies about it
movies,removed,get a roku or amazon firestick
movies,removed,id say the trailers imply that they were both woken up together for reasons i guess if one woke up the other to screw her over because he was lonely thats a bit more onesided it wouldnt exactly be a huge plot twist though being only millimeters away from what we already know if that twist were revealed by the trailer id be way less interested in seeing the movie selfish guy screws over chick who eventually falls in love with him her finding out is inevitable only remaining question is whether or not she loves him enough to stay with him sounds really bad compared to the walle style premise that we get if theyre both on even footing
movies,removed,who the fuck do you think you are stealing your pixels know what you wont be stealing with a name like that anyones virginity mother fucking fuck face honestly you must be so cool with a karma count like that thinking youre the fucking man aye well youre not kiddo youre nothing ill end you you god forsaken little fucknugget bringing up the fact i support trump know what else i support the death penalty for cucks like you holy jesus fuck why do you even come on this site you nigel no mates ass nigga if you died tomorrow the world would legitimately be a better place you pathetic waste of space merry christmas dickhead

movies,removed,im going to copy my comment from youtube about some bad experiences i have had this year im even getting angry just thinking about these experiences ill share a few i doubt anybody will have read all this though a couple of days ago my local theatre had a film festival for people from through grade film festival meaning free movies me and my friends attended this event even though we are a couple of years too old we began watching the jungle book id say the average age of the people in there was there was a bit of talking not too bad since it was a big room seats but then they started howling with the wolves in the movie and mimicking other animals then there was this one kid that started clapping every time he got startled people couldnt sit still either and at the end of the movie a majority of the people thought it had ended so they stood up and started walking out when there was about minutes left then we watched deadpool which was a pretty good experience since many of the kids couldnt get in there but there were a few people who kept going in and out of the salon we then finished of the night with xmen apocalypse which was the worst experience of the night there was this gang who went in and out like a hundred times people sitting with their phones with the sound on this nerd who sat and held a commentary yeah quicksilver and spoiler alert when phoenix was about to appear he sat there for a minute saying phoenix damn an even worse experience though was with the warcraft premiere a couple of weeks ago there was this dude who came in during the commercial and he shouts so what server you guys on and im like yeah thats nice hes socialising a bit before the movie how wrong i was he kept talking loudly during the whole movie i think he was high tbh people kept shushing and telling him to shut up and he would say sorry and be quiet for seconds and then continue shouting even worse is the fact that he had no idea what the hell he was talking about he seemed to have zero knowledge of the lore nor what the movie was about everytime orgrim appeared he would scream thrall i havent even played the games except for but not the single player but even i knew the lore better than him while watching bvs there where these early teenagers who began talking alot in the end of the movie which totally ruined the mood they also started throwing their shit in the dumpster from their seats which was very distracting they also laughed and thought they were so damn cool one of my viewings of deadpool or some other movie cant remember back in february had this spastic kid who sat there shaking his leg like an addict with abstinence he also happened to have the most annoying laugh ever which you cant really blame him for but still super annoying and he laughed at the parts which wasnt even funny he ended up spilling out all his popcorn because of his damn leg shake and i started smiling karmas a bitch that leg shake was seriously so annoying it was a small salon and he was two seats away it felt like a damn earth quake my final disturbance that i can remember was from the revenant these young girls come in there i think this was their first rrated flick and they probably only watched it for leo everytime there was something slightly gruesome they would make a comment they sat with their cellphones the entire film and talked to each other and giggled which ruined the immersion immensely when the movie was over i could hear one of the girls say something along the lines of the movie wasnt very good there wasnt really any plot and you cant really understand whats going on and i just sat there thinking to myself maybe you would understand something if you actually watched the movie you fucking retard enough complaining from me now and if you made it this far into the comment id like to apologize for my english skills

movies,removed,the autism is strong with your friends
movies,removed,i started a personal boycott against movie theaters back in and i havent stepped foot inside one since other than bothering my girlfriend its been very easy to do and i recommend everyone do itwith torrents and tvs its easier than ever oh and the last movie i saw in a theater was borat tickets were free and it was still a miserable experience
movies,removed,and they wonder why people torrent
movies,removed,is still like a nightmare thats still little bitches snapchatting and texting and their hoodlum boyfriends screaming shit some soccer mom with her special little snowflake that wont shut the fuck up fuck people movie theaters are ridiculous ive just decided i still cant handle it even with assigned seating long live thepiratebay
movies,removed,are you retarded
movies,removed,i agree with you im completely fine with movie trailers starting at the displayed showtime but the car ads and other bullshit are just asking for me to torrent popcorntime or wait until its on netflix
movies,removed,this is why i torrent all my things now unless it is something spectacular that i want to support im just tired of being fed ads for everything i do i understand making money but paying for a ticket and the popcorn and soda should exempt me form the ads
movies,removed,hahahai use torrent kickass trrents no ads no need to pay
movies,removed,i thought people didnt watch cable bc of pirate bay and free and all
movies,removed,you can spread your ass cheeks apart and take it like the little bitch you are but that doesnt mean im going to
movies,removed,take some ear buds with you and jam out to some music while the ads play or stay home and fire up a torrent yaarr
movies,removed,méxico too theres a brand called cinemex that will show up to half a hour of ads political bullshit chatity related stuff more ads and movie trailers i only go to movies if its an extremely good movie i torrent or stream the rest
movies,removed,sucking dick is not a career btw
movies,removed,nigga thats called rush hour
movies,removed,meh the numbers are better than ever so the theatres dont care worldwide box office numbers for hit an estimated record billion dollars granted the top ten movies made up of that number so theyre making more from less titles but those are still ridiculous numbers for an industry thats pleading mercy to pirated content the studios make the bulk of it and the theatres a very small slice so the theatres have to rape you on concessions and ad revenuepromosarcades etc to make their business worth the headache i torrent most of my shit ill see maybe a half dozen movies in the theatre a year and free with scene points im in canada so im good to go now and then
movies,removed,and that is partly why torrents do so well fuck movie theatres that charge an exorbitant amount of money for drinks or candy basically a markup plus the ads and bullshit no thanks ill sit at home on the couch with my food and drink and my smokes thanks pirate bay
movies,removed,yep you also dont really have alternatives in nuremberg for instance theres the powerhouse cinecitta with infinitely better va quality comfortable seats and a wide range of movies to pick from they have shitty popcorn but thats everywhere i guess i only go to the cinema if i want to watch a movie as soon as possible otherwise well torrent
movies,removed,just arrive later faggot also you must be drunk if you dont enjoy trailers
movies,removed,not only that but it has to of been at least years since i bought a dvd i just remember paying a maximum of bucks for a dvd i go to target to get a copy of deadpool and for the on sale price it was freakin dollars are you kidding me this is why people torrent movies and how can they not realize this

movies,removed,look is not the best film this year its not going to be anywhere near my top list but it actually has some good moments and some good characters and effects and it is not the train wreck a lot of people argue it is
movies,removed,actually out of all the remakes in there were a lot of them i would say was by far my favorite
movies,removed,yes i was like really you are going to reboot this mess and its not even going to be filmed in australia and youre recasting max with a brit this film will be a mess and wow i was wrong was my film of the year in
movies,removed,for me the one thing i cant see here is the squeals the first taken was so good the second at least had istanbul and a good premise even if it did not work but taken wow what a waste
movies,removed,look if they want to use this as the thing that separates the stand alone films from the numbered star wars sure fine what ever but then even didnt use the crawl that well
movies,removed,there is a healthy parentchild relationship in petes and hell thats even a stepparent as well

movies,removed,well i think im gonna go with the obvious rogue one a star wars story i think its main positive is that it just expands the star wars universe in such a cool way goes from planets to planets and shows you a different side of it of course everyone is discussing the ending which i loved but rewatching a new hope i noticed just how much it improves the overall narrative of the movie and gives it that much more weight it is pretty much everything i wanted it to be not a masterpiece of course it has its issues but for a prequel pretty much nobody expected to work i thought it did and in splendid fashion

movies,removed,the story was written by anderson dan obannon and ron shusett the latter two having written the original alien not criticizing your post or anything just wanted to correct this misconception the only reason obannon and shusett were credited was because elements of early drafts of their alien script was used in avp eg the pyramid concept iirc not because they had an active hand in writing the story during preproduction but overall i agree with you that anderon actually tried to httpsenwikipediaorgwikialienvspredatorfilmstoryandsetting in the canon of both film series and i commend his efforts for that

movies,removed,so your preferred political bias is that you side with churchaffiliated child molesters good to know

movies,removed,theres the movie its an anthology of horror shorts done by different directors where each one took a holiday and wrote and directed a short min well short some are pretty messed up and genuinely creepy while others are kind of campy and fun i also recently came across its not a scary movie by todays standards since it was definitely made for kids in the late but it would be fun to watch with a group of friends to sit and make fun of since it gets away with doing things you wouldnt see in todays movies like one kid calling another a faggot in the first min or a grown man dracula calling a year old girl a bitch right to her face
movies,removed,you know who has the entire imdb top vidangel check them out

movies,removed,the whole enchantress thing was a cgi mess it just didnt mesh well with what was happening she builds a machine and then later says its a spell in the end she just got a hold of the bottle that held her brother with no explanation as to why something like that wasnt under lock and key seeing as how the other one unleashed her it was just way too convoluted with no explanation and leto just wasnt the joker i mean he was just playing some crazy gang leader joker fanboy it just wasnt believable imo
movies,removed,a very good independent film that premiered in the discovery section of the toronto international film festival rossiff sutherland garnered a canadian screen award nomination for best actor at the canadian screen awards the film was chosen as the winner of the academy of canadian cinema and televisions claude jutra award as the years best feature film directed by a firsttime director i havent seen any publicity for it so wanted to share this recommendation and hopefully give it some exposure hope you enjoy

movies,removed,all rightwell give some land to the niggers and the chincs but we dont want the irish
movies,removed,no harley tits
movies,removed,anything related to fantasy witchcraft or cukts is usually a no go and the joker tries to have that guy in the beginning have sex with harley so thats a red flag for their cuck alarms
movies,removed,well take the niggers and the chinks but not the irish no aaw prairie shit everybody rejoicing he was fantastic
movies,removed,crickets
movies,removed,is it gay to suck your own dick
movies,removed,i dont need to taste a turd to know that its shit why the fuck would i watch a movie that absolutely looks terrible the basic fucking bitches thinking it looks good are probably under youre ridiculous and fuck you for calling me an idiot for voicing an opinion the movie looks like garbage and most likely is garbage sorry your fanboyism wont let you accept it
movies,removed,sheeit nigga i dont kno
movies,removed,i cant wait for the day where youll have a non shitty opinion on any movies out there still waiting
movies,removed,uhhh wheres the people of colour wheres the women racist and sexist much
movies,removed,he also was in blazing saddles all right well give some land to the niggers and the chinks but we dont want the irish aw prairie shit everybody
movies,removed,in the last years ive probably only been to a couple of movies that werent ruined by a group of black people talking through the entire thing
movies,removed,sheriff bart taking himself hostage just as the racist locals were about to lynch him might be my favourite gag ever somebody help that poor nigger
movies,removed,dock that chink a days pay for nappin on the job
movies,removed,alright well take the niggers and the chinks but we dont want the irish could you imagine if the movie was made today people would be losing their minds at the language totally ahead of its time and huddleston was an amazing actor
movies,removed,no because were all fantastic idiots did you notice kevin spacey is listed in the cast as a talking cat we all noticed we just didnt feel the need to point out the joke because thats something only idiots do
movies,removed,loved the cameo appearance at the end i dont think ralph fiennes has done voicework before right
movies,removed,because it wasnt an error it was a joke im cool being a dick to someone who couldnt figure that out
movies,removed,im not a masochist so im not motivated to find personal insults directed at me just because i didnt like a movie call me a loser because i thought the movie was going to be terrible will that make me want to shell out its nasty comments like that which result in women getting battered and abused because you know rihanna said to chris brown youre not a real man because a real man wouldnt sit there and take it right before he cracked that bitch in the skull
movies,removed,these comic book movies keep getting worse and worse please make it stop how about no you cunt
movies,removed,be careful this subleddits nazi mods are quick to ban anyone mentioning anything torrent related i speak from experience im banned for this comment
movies,removed,you can tell from all of the intelligent powerful black characters in thewait whats that im being told there arent any im sure thats fine though since we established that the savage we are laughing at definitely possesses a degree of animal cunning
movies,removed,that is one hell of a cast
movies,removed,h
movies,removed,guys no one told this guy racism doesnt exist in any form other than people yelling kill the niggers
movies,removed,as do you and i see that you spend a lot of time in asoiafrelated subs base on the proportion of posts to these subs im assuming that you are a casual book reader but not the type of person to sit around researching your own theory for weeks on end but you do on occasion enjoy a more serious discussion about the series and appreciate its depth you seem to be mostly focused on entertainment at this point in your life focusing on pro basketball and the scififantasy genre im therefore assuming that you are a single person you post during normal business hours which could mean that you have a night job but i dont think so i think you work in a fairly laidback office browsing reddit when its slow im guessing that you are college educated and ill put your age between if not college educated then you were at least an avid reader in your youth oh and youre from boston yeahstalking is fun
movies,removed,acceptable lmao fuck off and take your retarded shit with you
movies,removed,ohand by the way i dont think they like being called fagsanymore i think now they like being called homos
movies,removed,well you can see all of my thoughts on the film at httprsomereviewswebscom but personally it pisses me off enchantress was the villain how diablo was able to go super sayan without any explanation of his powers like that and how badly edited the film was and the same fucking act ive seen in every blockbuster from avengers to ghostbusters to tmnt
movies,removed,the movie started well but once they arrived on an island it went downhill and the movie turned into a military propaganda it was the americans needed motivations for invading iraq you can clearly see that there is a shift in the movies storyline
movies,removed,even though hes making a come back i still think that mel gibson screaming at this wife wishing that she gets raped by a carload of niggers was really bad
movies,removed,because comedy is about avoiding extremes not offending anyone eschewing stereotypes and finding a balance of positives and negatives in any situation faggot
movies,removed,well give some land to the niggers and the chinks but no irish oh wait that was him in blazing saddles what a career that guy had blazing saddles and the big lebowski of the greatest comedies ever
movies,removed,nobody gives a flying fuck about what you like and dont like

movies,removed,dude youre not listening lots of movies star asians in the sense that asians play major characters in the movie but the protagonist is almost unfailingly white people are acting like this movie is something that it objectively is not its a look at bruce lees character and philosophy through the eyes of a white western student everybody knows thats what it is were all just questioning why that was the story they picked maybe thats because theres a genuine story to tell there or maybe its because hollywood is afraid of having a white main character this time just like they were afraid when they casted ghost in the shell and death note and tokyo drift were not stupid we know what hollywood is up to all of this we gotta judge movies based on the culture theyre released in is disgustingly antiart the people who think shit like that are not artists they do not create art if anything that statement is antiart art and artistic discourse is absolutely a product of its time and its culture how could it not be ill agree with you that discussions about the quality of the piece are different ergo if someone says the movie sucks theyre obviously talking out of their ass because nobody on rmovies has seen it yet and if it does come out and a film critic says it is objectively a bad movie because of the racial thing then that sucks but its not antiart to hear of a movie coming out and go fuck theyre pulling this shit again

movies,removed,like you man
movies,removed,people dont magically make excuses for when every other reboot is shit they dont cry about it ruining their childhood or start campaigns or rally against it not even for reboots that are a lot worse and a lot more offensive than this one what this means is people that dont like the new ghostbusters tend to be overly harsh or critical likely because they are sexist but want to make it about other things to hide that they are useless monsters

movies,removed,weird that theyre almost completely eliminating rebecca fergusons character from the trailer either they reduced her character to a minimum or theyre keeping her a surprise for some reason or they dont want to show too many women in the trailer for fear of turning people away from the trailer as for the story the book ending is really lame and i hope the film remedies that somehow it always read like it should just be a movie and who knows maybe this time not every female character is a manipulating cheating broken idiot and not every male character is a rapey violent lying monster
movies,removed,who
movies,removed,
movies,removed,im going to see it and say it was better than the original because i am a cuck who doesnt want to be labeled sexist

movies,removed,what i didn see the fucking movie you idiot you think having the lone black woman in the film be a subway employee who acts like a stereotypical violent angry black woman was okay it was offensive especially at a time when racial tension is at a high but you must be a huge fan of minstrel shows
movies,removed,ah yes the men forced all those women to do those things against their will you fucking retard the foundation for your entire argument rests on the notion that women are unintelligent and unable to think for themselves eehhhh meh patriarchy eeehhh fuck off
movies,removed,cant say nothing to compare with havent yet seen a marvel made movie about a group of psychotic fucks sent on a suicide mission done in just a bunch stories about spandex clad faggots and a guy in a robot suit

movies,removed,it is pretty telling that honkeys are so insecure and fragile they cant even cast an asian man as lead its like the second a minority becomes the lead whites loose their control over the perception of minorities and the world will see how whites arent the superior race

movies,removed,torrent it that is what i always do
movies,removed,cinemas still have a monopoly on new release movies unless you torrent them illegally and all that competition after a cinema release is why studios dont care about film length theyre going to make movies people want to see period the end if its hours long they dont care as long as you pay to see it theyll make a movie thats hours long its the movie theaters that refuse to show movies more than minutes long because long movies cut into the number of seats they can fill in a day once the cinema becomes an option instead of a requirement well start seeing a better variety in film
movies,removed,leslie jones gorilla

movies,not_removed,britell owes a lot more of his sound to philip glass than beethoven
movies,not_removed,the only thing i hate about this song is how short it is all i can picture is chiron and juan on the beach when i hear this that scene was burned into my brain after watching the movie
movies,not_removed,the whole soundtrack is perfect if you havent listened to it its on spotify and its amazing
movies,not_removed,this song is like life sad short but ultimately beautiful
movies,not_removed,its a great piece of music its emotionally striking and helps elevate the movie as good movie music should
movies,not_removed,totally agree with this i thought this track was well made sends chills down my spine
movies,not_removed,i like that musically the piece is almost like an exercise just arpeggios over a familiar chord structure but the way its orchestrated and played adds so much depth that low foreboding hum of the orchestra and then the at first hesitant and gentle soloist becoming more and more frenetic until its flat out violent and the way she settles it down quieter again this time still gentle but resolute you might say im reading into it a bit but either way its a hell of a piece and an even better performance
movies,not_removed,its great it really reminded me of something that malick would use
movies,not_removed,this song is just fantastic i find it amazing how this song illustrates so many chaotic emotions and puts a visual image of a storm in my head through its instruments alone this playing in the background of the the trailer is what had me sold on this movie before i even saw it
movies,not_removed,especially for the scene its used this song accurately depicts the calmness and ferociousness of the ocean which i personally loved definitely my favorite scene in the movie
movies,not_removed,ugh anyone else just getting sick of hearing about moonlight i mean we get it it was nice good for them time to move on
movies,not_removed,i hadnt thought of that until i read this and now i can really hear it good ear
movies,not_removed,i had no idea it wasnt glass who until the oscars
movies,not_removed,it is what i liked best from the movie
movies,not_removed,it also played in the scene where chiron was learning to swim which was more emotional when you realize its signifying the beginning of his lifelong struggle to stay afloat in a world that doesnt accept him and hes only now starting the long journey of selfacceptance that will bog him down his whole life
movies,not_removed,you can hear the struggle in the song its crazy
movies,not_removed,no youre not i like how you broke it down the way you described it sounds like an analysis of chirons life constantly escalating to this point always stressful and getting worse and worse until it settles down which i hope is selfacceptance and peace in his life
movies,not_removed,i mean it just won best picture like less than two days ago so i wouldnt be surprised if people discussed it for a while
movies,not_removed,we arent on a schedule if there is still stuff to discuss and people still upvote discussion threads then what do you want the mods to do censor discussion its also an incredible movie so not surprising that its receiving a lot of buzz
movies,not_removed,it just won best picture and this is a sub for movies sorry but dont be surprised if youre going to be hearing about moonlight for a while
movies,not_removed,strange ive heard more about la la land than moonlight imo
movies,not_removed,then dont click on it if it got upvoted people clearly enjoy it so whats your problem
movies,not_removed,really feel like people have been talking about it for months
movies,not_removed,so have i what a wonderful film that was
movies,not_removed,how was it not pertinent youre saying that it fit the movie so well and the comment youre replying to just further illustrates why it fit the movie so well
movies,not_removed,they have been many believe its the best film of the past year including the academy how long would you like people to talk about it
movies,not_removed,lol
movies,not_removed,i dont know im sorry not sure if im upsetting people just seems like theres a lot of new movies coming out every week doesnt logan open up this week
movies,not_removed,how transparent can it get lol
movies,not_removed,logan opens next week i believe just because there are new movies coming out every week doesnt mean we shouldnt continue to discuss praise and criticize films that have come out whether it be from months ago to years ago
movies,not_removed,yeah lets stop discussing moonlight and get on to the next comic book movie
movies,not_removed,seriously
movies,not_removed,oh no i apologize i was just wondering what the deal is with this one feels a little over discussed
movies,not_removed,then leave the discussion
movies,not_removed,well made points here
movies,not_removed,stupid
movies,not_removed,is there a single internet publication that hasnt hired and fired this blowhard clown yet
movies,not_removed,same not sure how i feel about manbat ive always thought that was a bit of a contrived villain but someone or something that makes the people of gotham distrust batman and forces him to question the morality of what he does could be cool i also really like bobs thoughts on the joker

movies,not_removed,mcclure i remember him from such movies as p is for psycho and dial m for murderousness
movies,not_removed,i knew i had a bad feeling about this
movies,not_removed,youre right
movies,not_removed,he looked at the stars
movies,not_removed,he wasnt the lead in interview with the vampire or rock of ages

movies,not_removed,well ill be damned one of my favorite movies and i never knew that
movies,not_removed,same
movies,not_removed,i dont think i could ever put the word intriguing in the same sentence as cars
movies,not_removed,great scene though it does have one small technical mistake when buffalo bill sneaks up on her you see the shadow of his gun fall across her back in a pitch black room what light is casting that shadow
movies,not_removed,that scene was written before the proliferation of cell phones as a screenwriter im constantly fighting against the convenience of cell phones in my scripts its infinitely more difficult to build tension or trap your characters when everyone has the collected knowledge of mankind in hisher back pocket and the ability to quite literally call for help at any moment
movies,not_removed,this had me on pins and needles in the theater scary
movies,not_removed,ive always wondered why buffalo bill didnt shoot clarice when he had the gun pointed at her head is it because he enjoys the chase too much
movies,not_removed,well if his goggles are an active iremitting sort still invisible to human eyes there could conceivably be a shadow cast due to ir light emitted from his goggles
movies,not_removed,tldr thats thought to be a goof but is actually accurate nvd cannot see in total darkness passive night vision goggles wont work in a pitchblack roomthey need some light to amplify even if its too dim for human eyes or in the infrared spectrum for that reason night vision devices have an ir emitter to act as a kind of flashlight that the device can pick up while still being undetectable by the naked eye the shadow on her back was either caused by that or a very week light source in the room
movies,not_removed,how do we know that wasnt a moth
movies,not_removed,oh no i dropped my phone
movies,not_removed,do you write screenplays professionally
movies,not_removed,absolutely he was fascinated by her i believe to him she was an object something to admire and also to take possession of and yeah he was having fun watching her panic
movies,not_removed,never mind that crazy people will commit as much money as necessary to achieve their goals
movies,not_removed,never mind that he covets his victims using night vision goggles before he abducts them

movies,not_removed,and when you have a job you can afford things especially those things related to your passions
movies,not_removed,its a goof the scene was shot in the light the nv was post production it was talked about in the making of documentary
movies,not_removed,a moth that is gun shaped and falls in line with his outstretched gun hand
movies,not_removed,or dead battery or no signal

movies,not_removed,i watched the documentary on chiller a couple of months ago the same doc also appears as a special feature on the disc i believe
movies,not_removed,i just saw green room and it was the only movie i rated this year so far fantastic pacing and tension for so much of the duration of the movie my only complaint is that some of the characters died a bit too early but this movie was still a thrill to watch and that complaint is very minor fantastic performances all around notable yelchon and stewart
movies,not_removed,neon demon i loved it visually stunning creepy and had a dark sense of humor
movies,not_removed,my darling clementine because its a masterpiece

movies,not_removed,i saw life is beautiful for the first time this year blew me away
movies,not_removed,theres something about mary i dont know how i let this one slip past me for so long because i am a huge fan of farrelly brothers comedy films as i imagined ridiculously funny however what really surprised me was the amount of heart in the movie genuinely cared for the characters more than i thought i would for its genre i would go as far as to say this movie is perfection
movies,not_removed,midnight special and the nice guys

movies,not_removed,still sad knowing that well never get to see yelchin in anything again he had so much talent and potential
movies,not_removed,dont you think the characters were kinda dumb and steward was criminally underutilized also the premise was cliched
movies,not_removed,and an incredibly weak plot rushed conclusion and some of the weirdest character development ive ever witnessed
movies,not_removed,this looks incredibly interesting thank you so much howd you come across it
movies,not_removed,absolute loss his acting and accent were absolutely perfect in this movie and i loved him in the especially the latest new star treks

movies,not_removed,i noticed out arguably mel brooks most well known ones blazing saddles and spaceballs any reason
movies,not_removed,really anything mel brooks
movies,not_removed,youve been a lovely lovely witness
movies,not_removed,everyone knows the three stooges but not enough people know the marx brothers really i live in sweden and as far as i can tell everyone knows the marx brothers here while ive never seen the three stooges mentioned in swedish media or by swedes even once well except for a review of the three stooges computer game in the late which was how i first heard of them is it really that different in what i presume to be the us
movies,not_removed,i love a day at the races too
movies,not_removed,airplane is an awesome choice plus there is one scene in particular that year old me appreciated
movies,not_removed,he loved top secret thanks for the suggestions
movies,not_removed,damn quick change is a really good movie i cant believe i sortof forgot about it
movies,not_removed,so i mostly agree with you but dodgeball is not everyones cup of tea peewees big adventure would probably be completely baffling to someone new and okay thats about it thats a fantastic list
movies,not_removed,ive found that any best of type list that includes the awesome clue feels incomplete without the addition of the darned entertaining and brilliant murder by death they just pair up so well its my favorite double feature of all time
movies,not_removed,major league as well
movies,not_removed,he hates these cans
movies,not_removed,solid choice
movies,not_removed,on a scale of to its an
movies,not_removed,what kind of clown are you the crying on the inside kind i guess
movies,not_removed,great choice woefully under rated and unkown by most
movies,not_removed,do you mean the ed helms vacation just wondering havent seen it but if so odd choice considering the other movies are all considered classics
movies,not_removed,ghostbusters
movies,not_removed,youve got everything except spaceballs
movies,not_removed,dont mention the war
movies,not_removed,they were bound to be mentioned anyways didnt feel like their was a need for me to post more than a few suggestions hehe
movies,not_removed,i mean its sweden of course you all know marx
movies,not_removed,yes im in the us and yeah i would say so the three stooges seem to get a lot more love over here their shorts are syndicated on television quite a bit whereas i cant recall ever seeing a marx brothers movie broadcast i own all of their movies on dvd and i only found out about them through a family member that had a couple of their movies that i would watch while growing up im and i have never met anyone else from my generation that has seen a marx brothers movie i know they exist but i suppose they are few and far between
movies,not_removed,thats actually quite surprising considering how much of the humor in the marx brothers comes from wordplay in the dialogue
movies,not_removed,the shits really gonna hit the fan
movies,not_removed,please get into crash position oh yeah
movies,not_removed,lots of laughs lots of fun
movies,not_removed,i get that but its for a yr old so might be right up his alley thats also why i didnt put stuff like best in show on the list know your audience if you will and thanks
movies,not_removed,ill have to look that one up never seen it and back at you have you seen radioland murders
movies,not_removed,hell no saw it once on hbo and it was terrible it was so bad i try to forget it exists
movies,not_removed,well op said classics
movies,not_removed,shit
movies,not_removed,you started it
movies,not_removed,i havent seen it in fact i scarcely remember hearing about it im going to have to track it down now though it sounds right up my alley
movies,not_removed,in iron man they mention myspace
movies,not_removed,my computer will take up to bit when im finished invisible dad
movies,not_removed,i cant remember any time when faggot wasnt considered offensive using gay to mean lame was already considered regressive when i was in high school and that was the faggot was right out
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,any line from the net hackers or similarly themed movie is going to seem antiquated there is one line from wargames that will never be outdated near the climax of the movie the military are discussing whether or not to let matthew broderick have a turn negotiating with joshua then this gem from general beringer hell id piss on the sparkplug if i thought itd do any good classic
movies,not_removed,an oldie but a goodie from the last boy scout milo you think youre so fuckin cool dont you you think youre so fuckin cool well just once i would like to hear you scream in pain joe play some rap music
movies,not_removed,that was a joke about it being dated
movies,not_removed,south park would make that joke today louis ck makes a similar joke still
movies,not_removed,thats more than years
movies,not_removed,hence the oldie but a goodie preface
movies,not_removed,im just saying op was asking for movie lines less than years old
movies,not_removed,good thing its
movies,not_removed,zack snyder should do a movie of just fight scenes
movies,not_removed,getting a big thomas wayne style batman vibe here
movies,not_removed,i mean this isnt actually legit obviously there are a lot of interpolation artifacts over the video someone probably threw something like httprevisionfxcomproductstwixtor on there and stroked their dick while rendering dont take this as an example of being bad in cinema this is literately someone taking the fps webdl version thats out right now and fucking it up
movies,not_removed,i cant stand playing video games in fps and i cant stand watching movies in it feels sooo cheap i dont know how to describe it
movies,not_removed,batman is a lot more brutal herei like it﻿
movies,not_removed,ben afflecks batman is fucking amazing
movies,not_removed,if this was not filmed frames per second then it isnt going to look right because it is interpolated
movies,not_removed,dont like the look of looks like its sped up
movies,not_removed,the guy with a grenade what was his plan did he think that would kill just batman and no one else in the room
movies,not_removed,the warehouse fight is technically the best action scene in the movie but it is dramatically inert because a it doesnt need to happen superman could would and should just fly in there and save his own damn mom and b it is sandwiched between the two big climactic showdowns of the movie
movies,not_removed,murdery batman is really weirdbatmans entire premise is that he doesnt go to the dark side and cant kill the jokerwth
movies,not_removed,im totally down for this fps if a movie is filmed in it
movies,not_removed,is the ultimate edition bluray in
movies,not_removed,all my fav superhero action sequences are from batman movies onlyexcept for the time iron man suits up
movies,not_removed,well that was fucking badass im gonna buy this blu ray not because it was a great movie but because there was enough great parts in the movie that i want to see again and again like this
movies,not_removed,i havent seen this movie but isnt batman not supposed to kill anyone im pretty sure he straight up murdered more than a few people there xd
movies,not_removed,am i the only one who thinks this looks worse i find the higher resolution or maybe in this case higher frame rate makes the whole thing looked staged like i can tell its being filmed
movies,not_removed,say what you want about batman v superman but this is hands down the best action sequence in any superhero movie﻿
movies,not_removed,is there any version of this scene online thats good quality and not at id like to show this scene to some friends to convince them this film is worth watching at least the ultimate edition but it looks so much worse with the increased fps
movies,not_removed,im probably farming disagrees here but i think i watch too much youtube anytime i see something legit on there it still seems like cheesy fanmade garbage oo
movies,not_removed,thats not really just converted
movies,not_removed,ten seconds into the clip batman starts shooting a gun and murdering people batman the superhero whose entire character is built around a hatred of guns you know the things that killed his parents the reason he uses batarangs and bolos and martial arts the reason hes not just the rich punisher check out this scene from showing the day bruce wayne decided to retirehe was old getting his ass beat by thugs and picked up a gun without firing it to defend himself simply resorting to that out of desperation was enough for him to give up the fight batman killing people with guns is as out of character as spiderman randomly snapping peoples necks sure you can call it a gritty take on the character but at the end of the day it looks a lot more like a gross misunderstanding of the character
movies,not_removed,this looks awful really doesnt work for movies
movies,not_removed,why is he killing everyone batman is meant to save people not kill them
movies,not_removed,you guys arent doing any favors arguing in favor of this movie by down voting every criticism
movies,not_removed,anyone else curious what he did to that guy who got the knife in the shoulder did he just punch him in the gut or kill him i dont remember that in the cinemas
movies,not_removed,this looked a lot better in theatres and on a lower frame rate
movies,not_removed,what a bad movie this was
movies,not_removed,christ i hate
movies,not_removed,mouseketeers out in full force i love it
movies,not_removed,some of the moves are straight up taken from the arkham games i love it d it look like shit in though is for video games movies should stick to
movies,not_removed,it makes everything look like a daytime soap
movies,not_removed,this looks like a cable access our a cheap tv soap opera to my eyes is this just because im old and grew up not watching digital movies and tv does this look normal and good to younger ppl whos eyes have been trained on it
movies,not_removed,the only physical copies of the film available at the highest resolution blu ray will still only be fps
movies,not_removed,this is affleckterrible
movies,not_removed,needs more martha
movies,not_removed,this movie may be a turd but this scene is fucking awesome
movies,not_removed,boring
movies,not_removed,this is a pretty cool action bitbut man him blowing away people at the beginningthis isnt my batman i know but in the comics so and so i dont really care about the comics i appreciate them for their merit but i want something different in movie batman hes had almost years on screen now and the best iteration is still tdk trilogy imo his strict code of not killing informs us about the character his parents were killed by guns he hates and fears themwhich makes the joker his greatest challenge he pretty much has to be killed to be stopped and batman is not willing to do it affleck did a fine job with what he had but batman going around and capping peoples asses is just fucking silly to me edit bring on the downvotes fanboys i know measured opinions offend you
movies,not_removed,holy macarena there are sooo many cuts
movies,not_removed,get over this shit movie already
movies,not_removed,this is terrible
movies,not_removed,i tried watching it spoiler warning i just rolled my eyes on the bats lifting bruce out of the hole and the acting was so wooden the only interesting character was ben afleck and even then i couldnt get past half the movie without turning it off its boring some of the acting especialy jessy esienberg is just dumb and the movie goes from boring to ridicolous to boring it reminds me of the toby maguier spiderman gave it a chance and it disapointed massivly i hope wonder women and jla are better now that snyder is under control
movies,not_removed,so his armour can stop and absorb the impact of a bullet at point blank range but a knife goes straight through all in all it was a very average fight scene that any level of quality is not going to help the fight scenes in kickass are better than this
movies,not_removed,and on youtube with a bitrate of potato mbs
movies,not_removed,and made from a source so its not true anyway
movies,not_removed,injustice gods among us the movie
movies,not_removed,thats kinda what i was hoping this movie was going to be the one thing i did not expect to say coming out of bvs was i wish there was more action
movies,not_removed,something like the raid but with superheroes
movies,not_removed,he has and it was called sucker punch its a terrible movie
movies,not_removed,zack snyder should also never cut his movies
movies,not_removed,theres hope for jeffery dean morgan for flashpoint paradox still
movies,not_removed,it feels that was because only laughter track sitcoms and home videos use anything like weve got used to anything serious movies tv dramas having a sort of glow that only comes with lower quality
movies,not_removed,my feelings exactly it looks like im watching a soap opera
movies,not_removed,video games need as much fps as possible because you are actually interacting with the video with your mouse that means that the smoother the motion on the screen the most comfortable the gameplay is going to be with controllers its a little bit less noticeable thats why playing a fps game on a console with a controller is not as bad as playing the same game on a pc with a mouse movies on the other hand dont have any interactivity so they work better at like we are used to
movies,not_removed,i think its because it just provides more detail for all the small imperfections or lack there of to become obvious it makes the film set look like a film set its tooclean
movies,not_removed,home camcorders might be the reason it feels cheap if i remember correctly most camcorders ive seen record at higher framerates you might be thinking of the amateur home movie look maybe i dont know im not an expert on this stuff
movies,not_removed,have you disabled motionflow or other motion smoothing tech on your tv settings
movies,not_removed,i think its just cause that youtube video is and its bitrate is low
movies,not_removed,its that same feeling as that smooth motion setting that tvs have nowadays it can be useful for sports but is a really distracting and offputting effect with movies
movies,not_removed,being gullible is a marketing campaign by underachieving aaa developers to avoid the words consoles are shit and we cant optimize for the pc market because its too complex
movies,not_removed,im glad its not just me film feels like cheap video shot for tv and it takes the filmic look away from everything utterly cant stand it
movies,not_removed,im usually the same but i kinda liked it for this
movies,not_removed,ive come to the conclusion its due to two things the higher fps picks up the production quality more clearly so it feels cheap because everything is a prop ever see hd candid shots of actors on set in costumes and such it looks like that film makers still dont know how to light for they are lighting as though its and it feels off these are my two takes on the issues there might be more also shaky cam is much more shaky
movies,not_removed,its too clear choreography and stuff on wires look so fake because its too easy to follow the objects moving even at high speeds i feel it worked in the hobbit fps because of the fantasy setting combined with a story told from a hobbits perspective exaggeration is natural in those circumstances in a dark and gritty world it just looks silly
movies,not_removed,special effects or rather budgets and time constraints have not yet caught up with the level of detail required for such high data films to look genuine
movies,not_removed,i find to be a watchable rate not too cheap and not too slow
movies,not_removed,youre just not used to it in the context of proper movies thats all like most people however its objectively superior
movies,not_removed,yep looks like a tv movie
movies,not_removed,seriously he straight up stabbed a guy and punched another guy into the floor
movies,not_removed,he also has no problem with people dying around him granted they did to try to kill him but the lack of fuck given make it still brutal awesome
movies,not_removed,id like brutal batman better if he didnt kill people and wasnt a complete hypocrite psycho
movies,not_removed,he straight up murdered a guy fuck
movies,not_removed,im excited to see what he will do with it in the future
movies,not_removed,he doesnt break his uninterested frown once it takes serious willpower to resist the temptation to have multiple emotions and nuanced performance switching between them well the metropolis disaster sequence prologue was actually pretty good
movies,not_removed,thats partly because were just not used to it but mostly because the film wasnt shot at so to make this clip a computer had to generate roughly more frames to fill the gap this type of video is completely useless
movies,not_removed,plus instead of running away for some reason he decided to grab the cooked grenade
movies,not_removed,superman had to go to the kryptonian ship instead dramatically its great because this fallen batman finally gets his chance to save martha thus sparing clark kent from turning into what he did after his parents were murdered
movies,not_removed,its almost like its two different interpretations and universes or something and set before batman became the non murdery batman that we know by the end of the film oh wait it is at the first scene where he enters the batcave alfred tosses him a newspaper covering the guy he branded and says new rules this implies that batman has only started to act this way recently later bruce goes were criminals alfred weve always been criminals nothings changed then alfred replies oh but everythings changed and goes onto to talk about the feeling the rage and how it turns good men cruel also earlier in the scene alfred mentions that even you are too old to die young and later at the wayne cemetary bruce talks about how hes been batman for years this basically explains that batman has always been the batman we know until now and its only recently due to the metropolis incident with superman that bruce has changed partly due to the status quo being changed now that hes dealing with metahumansgods partly due to the fact that hes done doing things the old way which hasnt solved a damn thing and partly because hes too old for this shit but by the end of the movie bruce has basically reverted back and hints at the start of the justice league recruitment the multiple scenes in the batcave are so fucking important that all the critics never seem to pay attention to
movies,not_removed,i really dont think bvs batman is murdery he still doesnt flatout murder people its just that he doesnt really give a shit about whether they die from their injuries or whatever after he takes them down its a slender difference but thats kinda the point hes jaded cynical finally giving in to the rage that alfred talks about and only a hairs breadth from breaking his one inviolable rule bvs had a lot of problems but its portrayal of batman was not one of them in my view
movies,not_removed,after a couple decades anyone human is going to go through the frustration of ive been doing this for half my capable life and there has been absolutely nothing to show for it
movies,not_removed,the batman in this film has to have lost his way a bit otherwise at his best at his psychological peak hed never provoke a fight with superman and thered be no movie
movies,not_removed,yeah better leave joker alive but kill the lol
movies,not_removed,what you describe is the modern batman old batman killed people and used guns
movies,not_removed,i guess few people here read the most revered batman comic the dark night return
movies,not_removed,you dont read much batman do you
movies,not_removed,there was a high frame rate version of the hobbit released in cinemas i thought it looked really odd i appreciate higher frame rates for gaming but prefer movies at the standard
movies,not_removed,op is an idiot this movie was not shot in fps the linked video is fan extrapolated from which is not fps its fps stretched to
movies,not_removed,no
movies,not_removed,this movie has older batman in it and older batman seems to quit giving a fuck tbh
movies,not_removed,this batman is kind of ruthlessmerciless after twenty hard years of fighting criminals a large part of the film is about his fall from grace and how he fears superman because he thinks supes will become like him
movies,not_removed,there was a line something like weve been in gotham years alfred how many good people are left how many stayed that way hes gotten jaded by the constant criminal catchandrelease he doent go out of his way to kill but if a thugs life stands in his way he gives zero fucks about them
movies,not_removed,nah he still doesnt actually straightup murder people he just doesnt really give a shit about collateral damage anymore
movies,not_removed,he killed a lot of people in the movie
movies,not_removed,yeah its a really bad movie
movies,not_removed,thats the problem with filming at such a frame rate humans are very good at picking up these things giving viewers twice as much visual data means that special effects and make up have to be three times as good thats the problem they tried to combat in the hobbit and why things like wigs and beards were made from real hair because anything artificial viewers would easily be able to recognise its a pity that they only had so few months to film the whole thing so they could continue with that level of detail
movies,not_removed,great scene and its definitely up there in my opinion though i enjoyed the following action sequences more the dark knight truck chase the winter soldier highway battle and honestly thats probably about it
movies,not_removed,no way the truckchase scene in tdk is still miles better maybe not as flashy but theres actual characters besides batman involved and the tense build up makes it
movies,not_removed,not even close
movies,not_removed,this probably wouldnt break my top ten best action sequences in any superhero movie
movies,not_removed,eh i disagree the train scene in spiderman or the truck sequence in tdk easily beat this besides this is a batman i dont recognize the whole thing feels wrong
movies,not_removed,itd be better if it was more in character lots of murder doesnt feel right for batman
movies,not_removed,civil war still has the best action sequence in any superhero movie imo
movies,not_removed,its definitely the best scene of the awful movie that is bvs but its not the best action scene captain america and winter soldier had better scenes fighting each other in the winter soldier and with with each other in civil war
movies,not_removed,pfff haha
movies,not_removed,lol
movies,not_removed,it does look like cheesy fanmade garbage to be honest that plane does not seem to be affected by the laws of physics the hand to hand combat is awkward and jerky blocking bullets with complete disregard for the bullets momentum one scene ironman suit stabbed the next rifles missing at practically point blank
movies,not_removed,he did deactivate their guns
movies,not_removed,is fine this is fake done in post production
movies,not_removed,of them lived
movies,not_removed,i liked the movie not other peoples fault that you cant enjoy anything
movies,not_removed,this movie was not shot in op is an idiot
movies,not_removed,this movie is not shot in op is a
movies,not_removed,muh filmmm
movies,not_removed,i read this as needs more mothra and now i am excited to see batman vs godzilla
movies,not_removed,hahahaha what an original comment friend
movies,not_removed,not cool enough for zack snyder
movies,not_removed,i agree just not exciting at all i hate when the bad guys are all fucking stupid cliche batman fight scene through and through
movies,not_removed,he didnt write this movie
movies,not_removed,i feel david s goyer is also to blame
movies,not_removed,agreed batman is bullet proof now wow how suspenseful i wonder whatll happen
movies,not_removed,the bats lifting bruce is just a dream he says like right after it
movies,not_removed,you can stab through kevlar
movies,not_removed,yes a bullet would be stopped by armor but not a knife a lot of bullet proof vests in real life can stop bullets but arent for use against knives because a stabbing knife will go right through the kevlar
movies,not_removed,that actually make perfeect sense the mechanics to stop a bullet vs a knife are quite different
movies,not_removed,needs more semicolons
movies,not_removed,dredd then
movies,not_removed,i remember years ago there was a script kicking around for a green arrow movie called something like supermax the premise was i think something like oliver queen is framed for a crime and sent to a prison for those with powers i would expect a riot probably breaks out and he needs to fight his way out
movies,not_removed,i find sucker punch to be a very enjoyable collection of music videos
movies,not_removed,i really like it if you dont care about the story and just want to see shortskirt wearing karate mastering gunblazing teenagers fighting robots orcs and steampunk zombie germans its good
movies,not_removed,no it has a terrible story but its not a terrible movie
movies,not_removed,that was the weirdest shit ive seen to date it was like what kind of mind fucker bullshit did i just witness
movies,not_removed,ok i avoided that movie because people keep saying it is terrible well i finally watched it and its not that bad at all i like the story told metaphorically and there are a couple of great scenes there is a whole fight made with the camera flying through the bodies with slomo and fastforward that i have never seen before there are also hidden gems like the scene when the girls talk on the mirrors im pretty sure they recreated the set twice so the camera could move from from inside the mirror to the front seamlessly
movies,not_removed,is there really
movies,not_removed,thats it and my brain doesnt accept this is a movie rather just a play magic is gone and i feel detached
movies,not_removed,only comes with lower quality its lower quality in the same way that a muted colour pallette or a short depth of field are lower quality which is to say not at all vibrant colours long depth of field and can all be more realistic since they better replicate normal vision but who cares this is an artistic medium and these are artistic choices provides a different aesthetic yeah yeah were trained to dislike because of soap operas and whatnot but it doesnt matter theres a context behind every aesthetic choice and trend from frames per second to editing style to clothing fashion you cant just pretend that context doesnt exist and claim that people should get past their dislike of high frame rate for the practical benefits anymore than you can claim that people should ignore all the context behind why they dislike the style of cargo pants and start wearing for them for their roominess and many pockets this isnt aimed at you specifically by the way just the usual arguments
movies,not_removed,i know anyone know why this is
movies,not_removed,i thought i was the only one
movies,not_removed,or behind the scenes documentary it just looked more fake
movies,not_removed,this was my immediate association when blurays were becoming a thing and id walk into best buy apparently contrary to popular opinion i thought it was awesome and have always been trying to replicate the home videosoap opera settings at home
movies,not_removed,although it could be said that in the hobbit it made the cgi more expensive to render and quality took a hit it was an interesting experiment but i dont think we will be seeing many movies in the future
movies,not_removed,yup itll be tough for them to hide cables and harnesses
movies,not_removed,dont forget the crate slingshot from across the room that was a direct headshot his head left a blood trail down the wall a little excessive i dont know i dont get paid to make movies
movies,not_removed,those henchmen arent dead theyre just sleepy from all the fighting
movies,not_removed,he may want to lay low for a while because hes probably wanted for murder
movies,not_removed,thats because he has been batman for years he is kinda tired of it all he has been batman for years but gotham is still a shithole and considering robin is most likely dead i think he stopped giving a shit at some point and decided to take the shortest route instead of the cautious one
movies,not_removed,awesome last i checked all the dc fanboys hated it glad to see opinions soften
movies,not_removed,sad isnt it especially when that guy just wanted to be his friend
movies,not_removed,hopefully hes got some good screen time in suicide squad
movies,not_removed,i dont understand why people do this it just makes movies look like trash especially cg heavy ones
movies,not_removed,oh thats it i thought it looked like they use the smooth option in some tv they actually did it
movies,not_removed,was probably going to throw it
movies,not_removed,id find it easier to swallow that interpretation if it werent for the dumb comedy punchline at the end of the scene
movies,not_removed,i feel you man i think everyone expected a christian bale batman and thought batfleck would be like that but he isnt that hes cold and bitter after years and doesnt care for criminals he killed like guys eh he is human you too would just stop and think at some point and wonder if its all worth it i mean robins dead and alfreds talk with bruce clearly displays the kind of demeanor batman has
movies,not_removed,i think he murdered a couple of people outright in bvs i could understand him letting people die if he didnt straight up murderize a few people i mean he did let ras die in the first nolan bats flick having said that we can agree to disagree on batmans portrayal no hard feelings
movies,not_removed,yea but murdering is very out of character for just about anyone
movies,not_removed,doesnt mean it isnt a shaky precedence to base a movie around i mean the logic leaps and some would say stupidity of what is supposed to be the smartest man on the planetehh but cest la vie heres looking to the future caustiously optimistic
movies,not_removed,better leave joker alive tim burton would like a word please
movies,not_removed,joker specifically wanted batman to kill him to prove a point batman refused because he wanted to disprove jokers point batman only attacked twoface when it was absolutely necessary
movies,not_removed,old wonder woman was basically a bondage slavewe dont still look to the old incarnation as the definitive representation of the character at least i dont but to each their own
movies,not_removed,i do its pretty much what he said
movies,not_removed,agreed i was really excited to see it but the whole time all i could think about was how fake and cheap it looked give me any day
movies,not_removed,good
movies,not_removed,every time i think of winter solider highway battle i just want someone to shoot his legs why do they aim straight at the shield thing which shields stuff and not at the legs
movies,not_removed,batman gliding in the hk skyline was also great
movies,not_removed,i shot my wad when tumbler transformed into the batpod also batman gliding over skyscrapers in hong kong was a very iconic shot as well that whole sequence was sexy
movies,not_removed,you must not read a lot of batman comics then the original batman would hang his enemies from his plane also look up thomas wayne batman brutal as fuck
movies,not_removed,it does in this situation hes old tired defeated he left a lot of his morals behind a long time ago and is fighting for different reasons hes gone from trying to save gotham to trying to punish criminals hes in the mindset of they have to be stopped death or fear not justice of course the most likely reasoning behind this is the death of robin that was hinted at in the film
movies,not_removed,what you are saying lotsa mudering doesnt add to his characters guess he needs to wack even more fools in the justice league man was i sad after watching that movie
movies,not_removed,not sure why the downvotes youre right cool fight way out of character edit this is now my most downvoted comment ever thanks a lot you stupid long horses
movies,not_removed,which one is that
movies,not_removed,surely you mean that airport fight rightyuck
movies,not_removed,the whole thing just seems like snyder was trying too hard to make an avengers with dc characters when you remove the immersiveness of the theater or a darkly lit room and huge tv it really makes you see the major imperfections of this scenemovie
movies,not_removed,also he took a pointblank shot to the back of the head like it was a mosquito bite so guns seems a bit pointless though it does raise the question of how a knife got through his armour
movies,not_removed,agreed but is not fine for fictional films only when filming real things like nature or sports if youre on a set with costumes going greater than frames exposes this the hobbit looked awful too
movies,not_removed,the real batman would have saved them all
movies,not_removed,what does that have to do with liking bvsdoj i think its fair to say if someone didnt like it they are able to enjoy other things
movies,not_removed,i know its not shot in i was trying to express my dislike for this whole high frame rate stuff in movies is fine and people are used to it
movies,not_removed,i would watch that shit in a heartbeat
movies,not_removed,that scene deserves to still be made fun of come on
movies,not_removed,he doesnt really write many movies cowriting credits on imdb including two movies and and ive never seen people complain about the dialogue in films he did cowrite bar suckerpunch
movies,not_removed,well its his story the dialogues were good because they are rewritten by chris terrio
movies,not_removed,okay but thats still not the direct murdering he does in bvs batman blowing away people with gatling guns is absurd he also was backed into a wall in that scene either kill directly and purposefully or try and escape the situation tdk trilogy makes a point to show he doesnt like guns or the finality of death and i feel that adds greatly to his character
movies,not_removed,i know but its the blatent religious symbolism not unlike man of steel thats annoying
movies,not_removed,injustice gods among us the movie ultimate cut
movies,not_removed,reporting for duty
movies,not_removed,is a colon you fucktard
movies,not_removed,that was a different kind of action though although there was some melee the vast majority of it was just gunplay really really sweet fucking gunplay
movies,not_removed,christ that film was good
movies,not_removed,yup definitely not worth being a movie
movies,not_removed,the trailer was amazing the movie was broken
movies,not_removed,even then its still not good its a pg rated bordering on g movie about slave prostitution stripping without any of the actual prostituting and stripping instead its a movie about sex where everything sexual is turned into a fighting video game it may have actually been good if it had any edge to it it might as well have been made by disney
movies,not_removed,i really hope so he would be fantastic
movies,not_removed,tv shows and cheap soap operas tend to shoot at higher framerates and shutterspeeds so we just associate the two hfr is the future though the visual fidelity is phenomenal and in years well look back at and cringe that said this is interpolated it wasnt shot in high frame rate so youre not actually gaining any extra detail in the images its like fake slow motion
movies,not_removed,he also fired the first guys gun around the room its unclear if he actually hit anyone but its still weird to see batman use a gun
movies,not_removed,it seems that zack was inspired by the thomas wayne batman and the batman from the dark knight returns i think its awesome and a fresh take on the character hell likely revert back to his former self in justice league and the batman though
movies,not_removed,they should film the next mission impossible in high frame rate high frame rate tom cruise action stunt sequence would be awesome
movies,not_removed,look no further than the hobbit films imo looks like crap but i might give it another shot for the avatar sequels
movies,not_removed,true story my math power was weak last night
movies,not_removed,i feel the same way about frame interpolation on hdtvs its so ugly yet my family swears they cant even tell when its happening
movies,not_removed,what punchline
movies,not_removed,tldr its said that killing people becomes easier the more you do it if you mean by the general public sure but there are many many in this world where murderering comes pretty easily and even more people than that who have killed once or twice and realized the second time was easier than the first and could have become quite apathetic to it had they continued whatever job they were doing that it happened in assuming a combat arms mos or highsecurity gig i imagine that after a few decades batman would have accidentally killed someone felt terrible accidentally killed a few more people and then felt bad in principle only then has probably come across a few situations where killing someone was the only decision he had in that split second to save someone else again absolutely terrible the first time but not so much the time by the time bvs comes around hes been doing it long enough to not be so naive as to think you can rid a city like gotham of the level of crime it has without killing anyone no killing becomes more like a guideline than a rule
movies,not_removed,also his intention wasnt to kill harvey it was to stop him
movies,not_removed,i dont know where you get the bondage slave anyway the heroes dont killing people was made to keep villains alive thats why they are killed in self contained graphic novels even in the dark knight return which loosely inspired this movie batman despite using a tank with machine guns and rubber bullets kills also the most popular modern incarnation of batman is from arkhan games and this is exactly like the game clearly inspired
movies,not_removed,how about his breakdown after the death of jason
movies,not_removed,i think it was a bit too rushed for i mean they figured out some problems with the format as they were making the films
movies,not_removed,yup would have looked really weird
movies,not_removed,ditto
movies,not_removed,you can always artificially lessen the frame rate it is great to have more control they just have to experiment more with it before going on a production like the hobbit
movies,not_removed,well i do but regardless ive never dug the ultranihilism of millers batman not really my cup of tea on the page or screen
movies,not_removed,theres definitely a clear character arc throughout the movie i caught it in the theatrical cut but they added some additional scenes in the ultimate cut that give it a little more depth clark talks to an old man who mentions batman being a whole new kind of mean lately he also reads several articles about the caped crusader going to far and you learn a little bit more about how the batbrand is a death sentence in prison its super interesting and adds a whole lot more context to this angry bitter batman in my eyes
movies,not_removed,also add to the fact he is desperately racing against the clock to save the mother of the man whom he almost just killed all of this adds to why he is so brutal in this scene and his brutality throughout the film is explained
movies,not_removed,have you seen anything of post jason todds death batman hes angry and irrational in the movie hes mostly angry and brutal i dont find his brutality out of character in any way
movies,not_removed,every action sequence in civil watch is top notch
movies,not_removed,the airport scene
movies,not_removed,dc fanboy yuck
movies,not_removed,because its trendy not liking marvel movies in a dc thread
movies,not_removed,theres so many fucking bvswarner bros shills on rmovies these days holy shit
movies,not_removed,yes the fight between cap and bucky right before the reveal is incredible especially considering its the actors performing the fight even better the fact that its between two characters that have been developed or being fleshed out adds do much more to the scene
movies,not_removed,the fight between cap and batroc was fantastic the fight between cap and bucky before the winter soldier unmasks was amazing the other action scenes in the movie the nick fury car chase cap chasing down bucky after fury is shot the big shootout on the freeway are all great too the bvs warehouse fight scene doesnt seem like anything special at all to me batman punches some dudes throws a box at one and does a rock bottom it almost feels like something id see in the transporter
movies,not_removed,i loved the hobbit i feel like its just fashionable to hate on it or something
movies,not_removed,so far the real batman has saved exactly zero people unless im just checking the wrong news sources
movies,not_removed,the last scene addresses all of this bruce knows he went too far and he said we can all be better
movies,not_removed,as if religious symbolism hasnt always been around in a story about a superhuman who is sent to save the earth by his ghostly father
movies,not_removed,youre right though both mos and bvs are full of hamfisted religious symbolism
movies,not_removed,injustice gods among us the movie ultimate cut criterion collection
movies,not_removed,youre a colon
movies,not_removed,very satisfying
movies,not_removed,john wick dredd crossover pls
movies,not_removed,fucking a
movies,not_removed,just like bvs and watchmen the directors cut is a better film
movies,not_removed,but it was and the extended version is r
movies,not_removed,httpimgsxkcdcomcomicshdtvpng title hdtv titletext were also stuck with blurry juddery slowpanning movies forever because thanks to home video people associate high framerates with camcorders and cheap sitcoms and thus think good framerates look fake stats this comic has been referenced times representing of referenced xkcds httpswwwxkcdcom httpswwwredditcomrxkcd httpswwwredditcomrxkcdtranscriber httpxkcdrefinfostatistics
movies,not_removed,then why do people not have the same issues with videogames at highframerates if it was down to human biology then it should transfer across mediums
movies,not_removed,human biology changing radically in years what
movies,not_removed,hfr is the future though the visual fidelity is phenomenal and in years well look back at and cringe you might end up being right but i disagree i think helps hide the flaws making the world of the film more believable although i understand that was arbitrarily chosen it doesnt mean that the choice doesnt have its merits i think hfr will be great for documentaries and maybe animated features but if youre trying to make the world more believable then stick with a lower frame rate and for fucks sakes peter jackson if youre trying to make a fantasy film where everyone is playing dressup you should hide as much as possible hfr was horrendous in the hobbit
movies,not_removed,hfr is the future though the visual fidelity is phenomenal and in years well look back at and cringe no we wont movies are not video games i always get the impression that those who push the is the future nonsense are probably big gamers and regardless of the reasons was adopted as the norm in the first place it has become inseparable from the feelings we associate with movies and the perfect conduit for the dreamy otherworldly qualities i do think high frame rates will always have their place and should be experimented with but they wont become the norm you mentioned the hobbit as an example of good quality hfr and i along with many others im sure would strongly disagree i only bothered seeing one of them in hfr but the entire time it just felt like an expensive stage production of the hobbit awful choice of movies to showcase the format
movies,not_removed,and cringe i mean not really
movies,not_removed,tv shows and cheap soap operas tend to shoot at higher framerates and shutterspeeds that sounds more expensive why would they do this
movies,not_removed,he wasnt shooting the gun technically the henchman was trying to shoot batman with it and batman was directing it around the room
movies,not_removed,he doesnt fire it the henchmans finger is clearly on the trigger
movies,not_removed,yeah its definitely based on the dark knight returns where batman is pretty happy to dish out a bit of the old ultraviolence though he does pull up just short of flatout murdering people the joker actually makes fun of him for this when he snaps his the jokers neck just enough to paralyse him but still technically not break his no killing rule in terms of bvs i think the extra violence translates really well to the jaded cynical batman that snyder is going for and his casual lack of care about collateral damage is a good instance of showing not telling in a film often bogged down with exposition
movies,not_removed,and they can always take it down to for the theatrical release i really wish more movies especially action movies were shot with hfr first thing that comes to mind is hardcore henry everyone ive talked to said the action was way too fast and it kinda gave them a headache if it were in hfr i dont think that wouldve been quite as much of a problem
movies,not_removed,as will i at least pete actually shot those films at a higher frame rate instead of doing some post processing bullshit im afraid that hfr is the future especially for action oriented films even ill admit that a lot of the action in the marvel pictures is hard to follow from time to time
movies,not_removed,the thing about being supermans buddy
movies,not_removed,the point is situations where batman has killed are usually extreme situations where he has no other option or he has been brought to it by something terrible happening he doesnt just kill random thugs like this because of his moral code but also because he doesnt need to one of the big things that makes batman batman is the fact that he can take down a room full of thugs with guns without shooting any of them
movies,not_removed,hmmm havent read that ill admit looking up a summary of death in the family it doesnt look like he breaks his one rule but does get more unhinged i remember him losing his shit over it in knightfall but he didnt kill anyone there are stories where he crosses the line but it wasnt as habitually as in this movie
movies,not_removed,why would the brand be a death sentence i dont get that
movies,not_removed,they made a mistake with bvs solo stand alone movie should have happened for batman and then bvs it could have showed why batman is like this and what lead him to be so brutal instead of the one we know
movies,not_removed,honestly the fact you said the real canon batman makes me question everything else you said
movies,not_removed,then you misunderstand batman
movies,not_removed,no idea why you were downvoted the civil war action scenes are all extremely wellchoreographed have great editing behind them and have actual progression throughout
movies,not_removed,too much shakycam
movies,not_removed,way too many camera cutsa bit shaky too honestly russos combat sequences arent fluid or smooth to look at they feel a lot like stop motion at times
movies,not_removed,not hating on the film as a film just the presentation of it looks baaaaad
movies,not_removed,so his rampages were just a byproduct of a few angsty weeks i dont really buy it
movies,not_removed,i dont remember him blowing away people at all hes trying to stop the convoy its nothing nearly as egregious as what was shown at the beginning of this clip or the unintentionally hilarious chase scene before yes people did die in tdk trilogy but definitely not directly talia dying was necessary as destroying and halting the convoy at any cost was paramount in the trilogy wayne even comes out and says he doesnt like guns or killing its reflected in the action pretty well its not nearly the same as in bvs he stabs people busts their heads open and rams his batmobile violently into them and i do factor in the desert scene to an extent yes its a dream sequence but youre still representing the character i actually started chuckling when he pulled out a handgun and started shooting people its just an outlandish image to see batman like that and as i said earlier i dont really pay mind to the comics im talking strictly cinematic batman
movies,not_removed,but its not when the swarm of bats lifts the kid out of the hole p
movies,not_removed,you came out of your mommas colon
movies,not_removed,fuck that dredd vs mad max showdown of the postapocalyptic badasses judge of the cursed earth hunts down the nomad of the wasteland
movies,not_removed,never saw the dc for sucker punch can elaborate at all on how its better
movies,not_removed,are you referring to the mpaa rating if so then who knows what cockamamie reasons or bribery it took or didnt take to get those ratings forgive me if i dont take the mpaas ratings seriously im speaking about coming to my own conclusion from watching it myself its a kids film masquerading as an adult film which normally wouldnt be an issue but thats not how it was sold to the audience and its subject matter
movies,not_removed,i am unfortunately one of those people who think it looks fake maybe with more exposure ill get used to it but i think the main problem is that everyone involved in the filmmaking process needs to learn how to do their jobs again when we switched to hdtv make up costumers and dps needed to learn new techniques to make everything and everyone look right there was an adjustment period where some things looked good in standard def but awful in high def its just going to take some time for example this looked a lot better than the last hobbit movie did to me still weird but closer to acceptable
movies,not_removed,a movie is trying to pull you into its world and make you forget about the real world and enjoy an experience games by their nature can not do that as it requires you to actively interact in the real world with the fake world it can never get across the line of this being a fake world so increasing the quality of the video at the expense of making things seem more fake is never much of an issue
movies,not_removed,i have an issue with video games at it just looks off too me its not as noticeable as with movies and i think it has alot to do with things like the games camera and direction as a huge metal gear fan revengeance and mgsv were both fps and it just seemed like massive overkill i found to be much better on the eyes i try to explain this to people and it seems like foreign concept to them while the games were being developed fps was a big talking point i gather the video game communtiy is more tech savy and looking at the performance numbers where as a movie goer just wants a good movie
movies,not_removed,not sure but weird thing is a fps video of a game looks strange too at least it did when started appearing on youtube and twitch
movies,not_removed,absolutely and i know its conditioning but as a filmmaker and a content producer i absolutely detest hfr if i shoot my projects in i want people to watch it in upconverting the frame rate from to or just makes it look cheap
movies,not_removed,i think its in your head for the most part the hobbit movies were terrible but the hfr work was great imo the crew behind those movies are prooobbbably the most qualified in the world to be creating a realistic and believable world in terms of sets props costumes etc all of that stuff was as real as it can get for the most part not really fake at all so its unlikely the hfr is making it look like a set and more likely that you actually know its a set and the hfr just makes it look weird to you
movies,not_removed,you might end up being right but i disagree i think black and white helps hide the flaws making the world of the film more believable although i understand that black and white was arbitrarily chosen it doesnt mean that the choice doesnt have its merits i think colour will be great for documentaries and maybe animated features but if youre trying to make the world more believable then stick with black and white
movies,not_removed,people had the same arguments against sound and colour when they were first introduced which sounds ludicrous now its progress just give it time
movies,not_removed,cringe might not be the best way to describe it but well look at in the future like we do now with silent films black and white standard definition vhs etc its the logical next step do you honestly think well be watching films at in or years of course not its a matter of time and the time is soon
movies,not_removed,not necessarily expensive especially with digital storage tbh im not sure i guess it started as a broadcasting standards thing the reason film is at is because it was the fewest number of frames per second to give the illusion of continuos smooth motion and therefor the cheapest possible option when shooting on actual film weve been at for years due to this and people are struggling to accept anything else but digital storage eliminates this problem so now we can start pushing the quality
movies,not_removed,mental gymnastics
movies,not_removed,batman doesnt kill he just uses the stop hitting yourself logic
movies,not_removed,ang lee has a fps film on the way early reports are that the effect is amazing lifelike etc i think hfr needs a switch on for action off for drama or filmz are shotlit differently to compensate
movies,not_removed,i think the point is batman is a dynamic character i checked again and he does in fact kill with impunity following the jason todd story arc its not out of necessity but of outright rage he is killing joker he batarangs the guy in the face with the intention of killing him
movies,not_removed,i see what youre saying i have memories of him wielding guns following that story arc i could be mistaken but i thought he killed people in dark knight returns volume its been a long time
movies,not_removed,as i understood it lex luthor orchestrated the brand death sentence thing bat only brands people but its lex who tells the criminals to kill everyone with the brand to push batman
movies,not_removed,okay can you actually respond to anything i said in any meaningful way or are you just resorting to mocking my wording
movies,not_removed,firstly theres hardly any shaky cam used for some of the shots there is but for a lot of the flying shots or large scale shots or antman shot there is none second this batman scene uses far more shaky cam than the airport scene
movies,not_removed,so preferring one over another is hating on one
movies,not_removed,theres nothing mentioned in the op about choreography but if you want to talk about it the choreography in the fight between cap and bucky i mentioned is fantastic and again is done with the actual actors doing it its only taken up a few notches in the stairwell scene for civil war
movies,not_removed,he crossed a line trying to hunt down and stop superman the dream sequence proves that he was willing to go further with the killing and shows how dangerous he viewed superman i thought snyder did a bad job showing how far gone this batman had become but at the end i think we see a bruce who has come back
movies,not_removed,im pretty sure that happened to jesus at some point right
movies,not_removed,much like bvs if you didnt like the theatrical cut the extended cut probably wont sway your opinion however theres about of additional material a lot of scenes are rearranged and extended by a few seconds other scenes were cut entirely for no apparent reason all of it adds to the experience the flow of the movie
movies,not_removed,perhaps i think the reality is everyone has a different tolerance for framerates in video likely due to what they associate highframerates with i think the idea that human biology would have to change for people to prefer a different framerate is a bit extreme i think as filmmakers experiment with higherframerates and more audiences are exposed to it in film it will gain traction im sure many filming techniques were considered too real for the audiences of their time but have now become staples of the industry i also believe that games could be so immersive that you forget suspend disbelief that you are interacting with it the same can be said of movies which successfully immerse you
movies,not_removed,agreed fake frames are the worst when people have cinema mode turned on at their house i always get them to pause the movie and go into the menu to turn it off horrendous
movies,not_removed,i could see the seams on the bald caps and it was jarring every time they transitioned from a rocky location to a set based on a rocky location
movies,not_removed,sorry youre getting downvoted i actually enjoy this discussion this is all just opinion it would be cool to see a few peerreviewed studies on this i agree with ustrtdrt though i was more aware of every flaw in the hobbit whether that was because the hfr looked weird taking me out of the immersion thus causing me to notice all the flaws im not sure but i suspect it is because of the extra frames more frames make the video similar to what you see in real life if it is not real like a documentary im guessing our brains react in the same fashion as the uncanny valley effect
movies,not_removed,i knew youd say that someone always does its worth mentioning silent film and black and white film still have their merits and have yet to disappear but more importantly i dont necessarily associate higher frame rates with technological advancement in the same way we might have with colour and sound most of us actually associate it with cheap tv or video games the lack of colour and sound hindered creative expression to the point that the medium mightve grown stagnant hfr is really just an aesthetic choice and one that most find ugly and i know you could say the same about colour and sound and certain purists would even argue that we were better off without them but high frame rates have been readily available to filmmakers for quite a while now and theres a reason they havent been widely adopted or embraced for narrative film something fundamental is lost again though it does have its place
movies,not_removed,the reason film is at is because it was the fewest number of frames per second to give the illusion of continuos smooth motion thats not true was the fewest
movies,not_removed,thats literally what happened i just explained the scene
movies,not_removed,but its pretty easy to follow that batmans hand is nowhere near the trigger
movies,not_removed,hes not dead hes just taking a nap
movies,not_removed,burtons batman murders a bunch of goons im okay with a batman that kills ultimate edition also kind of explains that hes lost his mind and hes gotten a lot worse about hurting people
movies,not_removed,this cracked me up haha
movies,not_removed,isnt it only a portion of ang lees new film that is supposed to be in fps i seem to remember something about that
movies,not_removed,my point is not that batman never kills its that killing isnt a normal thing for him if it is then hes not batman hes punisher both of those examples you gave are situations were he was driven to killing by extreme events in batman v superman theres nothing in the plot which shows why he is okay with killing people hes just like that from the start and its never referenced as being out of the normal
movies,not_removed,i get the impression that lex knew everyones identities before the movie even started so this would make sense that lex would start this trend
movies,not_removed,thats retarded though the last thing you would do is mark an informer you want an informer to stay informed so that you can pump them for more information in the future if thats what snyder was going for then thats even dumber than i thought
movies,not_removed,the real canon batman i think what he means is there is no the real canon batman comic books characters change in just about ever episode thor is now a woman for example batman has killed before and batman has been vicious before i watched a ton of the tv series read alot of the comics and played all the arkham games the bvs batman is more like the arkham games batman than most of the comics but it does not diminish his validity bvs batman and the arkham batman seem much more likely to kill someone indirectly than most batman characterizations before he may not shoot them in the head but he will run them over with his car and punch them in the face with a armored fist to each his own though i dont like all the comics and dont really feel like thor should be a woman now i do really like this batman though your not wrong but neither is the other guy
movies,not_removed,adding to what others have said theres also no singular vision of batman different writers are allowed to take on their own interpretations of batman this movie included its fine if you dont like this interpretation but when you start throwing canon around it paints you as someone romanticizing some idealized version of what you think batman is and stands for
movies,not_removed,my response to your point was stated above this is a new batman hes different and designed to start at the bottom of a dark slope
movies,not_removed,there have been over years of batman comics and he has killed a lot throughout those years batman doesnt have to be the same in every iteration of entertainment a batman who has given up on his morals is an interesting character thomas waynes batman is pretty badass and brutal
movies,not_removed,having watched both i can say that the airport scene uses way more shakycam simply moving the camera doesnt count
movies,not_removed,theres nothing mentioned in the op about choreography im not op though no conversational rules were broken here we are not on a debating team and when i contextualized my post with entirely on the grounds of fight choreography you replied in the affirmative its perfectly fine for you to feel that way of course but
movies,not_removed,fair enough but one thing we can agree on is how badly this was all conveyed i still dont think batman going in a rut is strong for the character i like my batman to have his strict code this batman was overly emotional in tdk wayne only seems to show emotion when hes reserved to his home and alone which adds a brooding element
movies,not_removed,i get what youre trying to imply and its a big reach my stance is clearly and concisely stated no need for failed attempts to try and subvert my argument
movies,not_removed,my bad luke while they were still talking about this jesus himself stood among them and said to them peace be with you they were startled and frightened thinking they saw a ghost he was riding on a cloud of swirling bats
movies,not_removed,an wholly awkward sequence that feels like jon hamm basically saying this isnt going to be rape because im going to tell you to consent
movies,not_removed,if you forget that you are interacting with it you arent interacting with it in an interactive medium that is a bad thing as for if higher frame rates in movies can be good or not who knows i was only addressing why it isnt important in games in the same way i think if the frames argument works how most people mention though it isnt going to be something we change past i think the frames is simply a good signal to the brain to begin to suspend disbelief i think at frames per second it is low enough to be visibly different then the normal world we see while still high enough to create compelling visuals i think the biggest strength of the frames is simply that it is something that can very easily trigger the brain to suspend disbelief because it doesnt look real because it doesnt look real when non real things happen it doesnt create a conflict with our perception and because it doesnt create a conflict it is very easy to be pulled into a movie i think the problem with higher frame rates isnt that they look fake so much as they look real and so the fakeness of the movie becomes more apparent because the brain is trying to process it as it would real life
movies,not_removed,i disagree entirely its not an aesthetic choice at all its a technical one equivalent to higher resolutions as was colour and sound these are all technical advancements which are then used creatively because theyve become available the visual fidelity of hfr movies is considerably higher than the current format and when that starts getting used well itll become the norm its not been readily available for as long as you imply digital storage has only recently become largefast enough to store the masses of data think about how much a ssd would have cost you years ago did it even exist the bottom line is we only think something is lost and it looks weird because its just different i can totally see where youre coming from and i used to think similarly to be honest but theres absolutely no way were going to stay at forever like i said this is the future of cinema
movies,not_removed,watched it last night and yeah batman has kinda lost it and is okay with straight up murdering people if he has to
movies,not_removed,i dont know dude i cant seem to find a definitive yaenae just that its like looking through a window
movies,not_removed,on the contrary the batman we meet in the film was broken after the murder of robin this is not just subtext its explicitly shown in the film robins uniform and referenced by alfred and is therefore part of the plot
movies,not_removed,i agree with a good portion of that but i think sort of the opposite on the emotion part i think this batman had little to no emotion and was much more ruthless the one gripe i had with nolans batman was bruce was trying to quit for the majority of that trilogy he would have rather have been with rachel than be batman to me thats not a good representation of the character but i suppose no matter what there will always be criticisms on how the role is portrayed
movies,not_removed,this is the same illusory rhetoric ive seen over and over again from the guys who support hfr to this extent youre not telling me why its the best way to watch a movie youre just telling me its the future that i refuse to accept change youre talking like a salesman im not against it in principle or any tool that purports to enhance the experience of watching a film and nostalgia is not really factoring into it im not some luddite purist i understand the appeal of hfr on the face of it i can only refer to my experiences with the format and they havent been good practically no one enjoyed the hobbit when it was presented that way now if were talking about virtual reality or using hfr to achieve an effect along those lines then sure id be excited to see how the technology becomes finessed and utilized for those kinds of experiences and ill be interested to see how successfuly the avatar sequels manage it seeing as theyll be predominantly cgi im assuming but there is a softness that comes with that is preferred by most and almost required to create the illusions associated with cinema otherwise we end up with a strange phony unreality that doesnt look good maybe someone will come along and blow everybody away with it and everyone will hop on the hfr train but there are legitimate concerns at the moment that arent just rooted in stubborn ignorance i dont want to sound like a twat but we are still talking about art here youre not upgrading your gaming pc
movies,not_removed,batman killing people is in character for batman hes killed plenty of people im just a little miffed about the guns thats out of character for him the no killing rule is a recent change no guns was way back in the day
movies,not_removed,yeah the only major gripe i had with the trilogy was waynes selfimposed exiledidnt fit really at all
movies,not_removed,fair enough and i agree on many things i enjoy the burton batmans for what they are but the killing in those was even more egregious at times i think they hit a stride in tdk for what batman should mostly be in movies
movies,not_removed,i mean i get that it added depth to the character but imo it really took away from how dedicated batman is supposed to be bruce would never know how to be anything other than batman thats the whole point to me
movies,not_removed,tdkr is the weakest film in the trilogy by far because of things like this ledgers death really derailed how it was supposed to go
movies,not_removed,american honey and moonlight are two recent movies released
movies,not_removed,room and short term are must watches
movies,not_removed,the only one that i feel like id probably want to skip is tusk but im open to reconsider if someone can tell me that its not as kevin smithy as it looks tusk is not as kevin smithy as it looks but the movie just falls apart after its great set up he came up with a wacky central premise but he should have spent more time on the storyit goes nowhere the lobster on the other hand works even though its wacky central premise falls to the wayside in the second half it shifts gears but still keeps you invested in what happens to the main characters
movies,not_removed,under the skin is in my opinion one of the best sci fi films of the past few years slow west is a great violent and smart western with a great performance from micheal fassbender tusk is a pretty interesting film its really different from the rest of smiths filmography if youre into wierd monster movies its worth a watch
movies,not_removed,theyve only been recently released but both american honey and moonlight have been on my watchlist since theyve been announced american honey is honestly one of my favorite movies of this decade and ive yet to watch moonlight
movies,not_removed,short term
movies,not_removed,please watch the end of the tour it makes you think about life and the pain you may feel in an entirely different light and jason segel i feel understands david foster wallace perfectly
movies,not_removed,the new york times said that moonlight an release is possibly the best movie of the year
movies,not_removed,free fire out next year looks good
movies,not_removed,not but i also really enjoyed hunt for the wilderpeople its from the same guy that did what we do in the shadows
movies,not_removed,a most violent year mojave
movies,not_removed,sea of trees is probably another one to skip spring breakers is apparently pretty good but i havent made it around to watching it yet blue ruin isnt but its the same director and much of the same cast as green room
movies,not_removed,kicks directed by justin tipping
movies,not_removed,in addition to the movies youve already mentioned under the skin i thought spring breakers was pretty great amy amy winehouse doc slow west and the lobster is one of my favorites from this year i was very disappointed in cut bank it was a poor mans coen bros pic and mojave
movies,not_removed,captain fantastic and exmachina
movies,not_removed,locke a most violent year ex machina while were young slow west room the witch the lobster
movies,not_removed,of the ones you havent seen i would rank them starting with the best as amy american honey spring breakers under the skin
movies,not_removed,you need to watch the spectacular now great performances from all actors and long confident takes where the director lets the scenes play out for sometimes minutes at a time
movies,not_removed,under the skin ex machina room and the witch
movies,not_removed,the witch
movies,not_removed,watch tusk at least once even though its funnier the second time
movies,not_removed,moonlight is also the first movie produced
movies,not_removed,i really love under the skin but understand people that dont it requires a lot from the viewer by giving them very little but what it does give fits so well with the core of the film tusk was genuinely interesting and a little unnerving until the reveal and the subsequent detective monologue then it becomes an inane satire
movies,not_removed,these are exactly what id recommend but i would add a most violent year too thought it had great atmosphere with pretty good performances by oscar isaac and jessica chastain too
movies,not_removed,the bad editing in under the skin made the movie more boring and pretentious that it should have been the shots are simply way too long you could cut down the length time by its really weird the movie clearly isnt aimed at an audience who doesnt understand cinematography and symbolism yet the shots length suggests the director simply doesnt believe the audience will understand and pick up things unless they have an overly long time to do it the result was a bad pacing and the feeling that the director was going get it did you get it she sees the fly that cant escape and it makes her think of her prisoner who cant escape get the metaphor
movies,not_removed,slow west is a pain in the ass to find
movies,not_removed,you talking about the kurt russell one if thats the case then i agree
movies,not_removed,rambo is a pussy
movies,not_removed,i really liked spring breakers but its a very weird movie
movies,not_removed,amazon prime
movies,not_removed,has a deal with amazon to distribute their films on prime video which is awesome
movies,not_removed,nice
movies,not_removed,obligatory hate comment about ghostbusters
movies,not_removed,well im excited
movies,not_removed,torture
movies,not_removed,i used to work at a place that bought and sold used dvds and blurays sometimes people would bring in likenewcondition movies to sell and as i would be looking through them id get to a title like vampires suck or double take every time it would make me stop and think holy shit somebody actually went to target and bought this movie on dvd so they could take it home on purpose and id just want to ask the person what had possessed him or her to do that like how does one make that kind of mistake if i was still working at that place and i saw fall out of someones bag of stuff i think id have that reaction
movies,not_removed,if theres more footage with neil casey andor mackinnon sign me up casey in particular felt like a victim of editing and hes such a goshdamn good actor
movies,not_removed,havent even seen it and can tell you this a flop
movies,not_removed,yawn
movies,not_removed,and noone other than the sadomasochists care
movies,not_removed,are all the parts to make it a good movie included
movies,not_removed,if youre on santas naughty list then you get this in your stocking
movies,not_removed,isnt that true if any financial flop though you dont need to have seen the movie to see the box office returns i guess what im trying to say is whats your point here
movies,not_removed,yes they are in a section called the theatrical release
movies,not_removed,any tips to get on santas good side im a little worried already
movies,not_removed,the wild life is a perfect example of what will definitely be the crap to come
movies,not_removed,there have always been talking animal movies i just named in my head and none of them came out in the last years
movies,not_removed,not that i think hed do a bad job but i think hes better off sticking to his own stories
movies,not_removed,huh probably wouldve been similar to that azzarello corben max miniseries around they kept his powers vague real world disfigured dick tracy gangster versions of marvel villains heavy blaxploitation influence and the plot was in the red harvestglass keyyojimbo formula where the enigmatic stranger comes into a town run by feuding mobs and pretends to work for them while pitting them against each other for his own reasons good comic
movies,not_removed,i kinda doubt that marvel would have let him
movies,not_removed,i feel like even if they did it couldnt be canon because so many people wouldnt see it because they dont like his style or he would make it too gory and itd be a different style from the other marvel movies hed definitely want way more creative control than the studio would give him
movies,not_removed,how do they even have a wrong envelope
movies,not_removed,who gives a fuck the show is over the right people got their precious award move the fuck on
movies,not_removed,he was tweeting before the whole slip up about emma stone winning the best actress award maybe it mess with his train of thought and subconsciously gave the wrong envelope titled best actress award
movies,not_removed,there are two copies of each envelope each accountant is holding a full set on different sides of the stage one hands the envelope to the presenter and the other envelope can be used to verify the accountant grabbed the second best actress envelope instead of the best picture one
movies,not_removed,its almost as if tweeting was more important than his actual job but lets not derail the discussion by talking about trump here
movies,not_removed,what i didnt mentioned anything about trump at all
movies,not_removed,the most redeeming thing about the star wars prequels must be the score
movies,not_removed,oblivion holds a special place in my heart and the music matches the visuals of the movie in that both of them are beautiful i dont like oblivion but i certainly dont hate it either it has its moments
movies,not_removed,spiderman its a lot of rehashed danny elfmam themes from the first two films but theres some really good original content by christopher young and the whole thing is fantastic never got a release though probably because of the feud between sam raimi and danny elfman at the time
movies,not_removed,man of steel and batman v superman despite being generally mediocreimo both had amazing soundtracks although i feel like i am in a minority when it comes to disliking the wonder woman theme
movies,not_removed,the angry video game nerd movie had a soundtrack way better than it has any right to have while the httpswwwyoutubecomwatchviwikgtrcply is based on the shows theme bear mccrearys version is still amazing and builds up extremely well going through eras of video game music also knights of badassdom is an alright film but also has a brilliant metal soundtrackalso bear mccreary
movies,not_removed,shades of grey i dont even watch the movie since i think the source material itself is ridiculous but the soundtracks are pretty good i have several of them on my playlist until now
movies,not_removed,van helsing actually love the score film is pants
movies,not_removed,the fountain
movies,not_removed,tron legacy havent seen the film a second time but have listened to the soundtrack to death
movies,not_removed,there are aspects of the transformers movies that i like but even i can agree that the majority of them is shit however something that is always fantastic about them is their music
movies,not_removed,i dont like the star trek movies but love the scores especially part iv
movies,not_removed,suicide squad had a great soundtrack movie was meh they kept on throwing in these great songs to enhance the quality of the scenes felt forced
movies,not_removed,fear and loathing in las vegas
movies,not_removed,spawn or virtuoisty
movies,not_removed,quantum of solace
movies,not_removed,i thought theory of everything was rather bland but the soundtrack is nice studying music
movies,not_removed,i wouldnt say david gordon greens prince avalanche was necessarily bad but the score by explosions in the sky and david wingo was unbelievable and towers among the other aspects of the film
movies,not_removed,battleship the movie is shit but klaus badelts score is magnificent
movies,not_removed,the amazing spiderman the movie is dull but james horners score is an elegantly constructed and beautiful work that remains the best superhero score of recent years
movies,not_removed,not a movie but the tv show flaked on netflix didnt really do it for me but the score was awesome and very dreamy
movies,not_removed,batman forever the soundtrack is cartoony and silly at times but it is also epic love to put it on whenever i play one of the arkham games
movies,not_removed,ok i didnt dislike under the skin but i definitely liked the soundtrack better than the actual film
movies,not_removed,queen of the damned had an amazing sound track
movies,not_removed,the amazing spiderman the film is shit but i always get pumped while listening to the electro suite
movies,not_removed,the twilight saga had great soundtracks
movies,not_removed,recently the neon demon terrible movie but what an amazing ost
movies,not_removed,goldeneye has one of the worst movies scores ever
movies,not_removed,imo its the vastness if the universe both the og trilogy and tfa suffer from a claustrophobic feel it doesnt feel like its an a huge universe the prequels and the clone wars do a really good job of showing how big the sw universe is
movies,not_removed,i remember walking out of the theatre thinking the movie was shit but the music was amazing im a huge fan too and was super shocked to get home and see he composed the music
movies,not_removed,susumu hirasawa always delivers on great soundtracks same guy did the music for paranoia agent and the original berserk
movies,not_removed,great score i liked the movie too actually
movies,not_removed,sorry friend i think you misread the question
movies,not_removed,you say claustrophobic others would say more personal and intimate
movies,not_removed,yeah well we are talking about a universe not your relationship
movies,not_removed,the drug deal scene from boogie nights
movies,not_removed,the carousel scene from fear and loathing in las vegas
movies,not_removed,when dalton rips jimmys throat out
movies,not_removed,the coin collection scene from throw momma from the train keep in mind that the past minutes of the film have been about showing how annoying and useless owen danny devito is and how much you should dislike him
movies,not_removed,the behind the wall reveal in profondo rosso
movies,not_removed,stone henge spinal tap
movies,not_removed,remember the titans hospital scene
movies,not_removed,the first fight scene between neo and morpheus in the matrix
movies,not_removed,sicario ending dinner scene goodfellas bar scene where they stomp billy batts game of chicken between joker and batman in dark knight
movies,not_removed,the docking scene in interstellar the song no time for caution is what really makes the scene as epic as it is
movies,not_removed,they live first time wearing the glasses a runner up is a little bit later the put on the glasses scene
movies,not_removed,when dianne visits bob in drugstore cowboy and the ending of american pyscho also all the scenes in american beauty love that movie
movies,not_removed,the scene at rahads house from boogie nights or the final duel in the good the bad and the ugly
movies,not_removed,one that comes to mind is the dinner scene in the untouchables though its nigh impossible to really answer this
movies,not_removed,when luke first arrives in bespin and enters the room where han was frozen that whole scene and movie from that point on is perfection
movies,not_removed,the final scene of before sunrise
movies,not_removed,good shout
movies,not_removed,too many to count the right answer how does one choose between say the deer hunter russian roulette scene the bank robbery in heat the apocalypse now helicopter attack the the shawshank redemption ending and any number of final duels in a sergio leone film
movies,not_removed,was both hers and errol flynns first major film
movies,not_removed,you speak treason fluently
movies,not_removed,you jinxed it
movies,not_removed,she said she hasnt written her autobiography yet because she plans to live to be
movies,not_removed,olivia de havalongevity
movies,not_removed,she comes from an impressive family
movies,not_removed,owivia de haviwand
movies,not_removed,she was great in the heiress too starts off all timid and unsure in her personality but after montgomery clift betrays her she completely changes personality shes one of the last significant ppl still standing thankful that theres a tcm channel to see them in their day and maybe to get a few welldeserved tributes before and after they pass
movies,not_removed,boom motherfucker shes now edit do you think when she was a kid back in the she ever thought to herself some motherfucker on reddit best not pull a fuckin harper lee and jinx my shit on my motherfuckin birthday i like to think that she did edit i totally thought it was july
movies,not_removed,where in the world is it july
movies,not_removed,its all good man she was born in tokyo japan that means about six hours ago was the start of her birthday in the place of her birth i dont know how we did it but we managed to unjinx it rmovies
movies,not_removed,awwwwww shit i fucked up i messed up the dates
movies,not_removed,rip olivia de havilland
movies,not_removed,fuck dont put that on me man
movies,not_removed,there was a nocturnal animals thread the other day and im just going to repost what i wrote there because im really lazy but i think it applies lol whats cool about imo is that you really cant deny that his films have a certain styleaesthetically and thematically they seem to fit what you might interpret to be his vision as a designer like many im most familiar with his classic menswear he doesnt design casual clothing but rather sharply tailored suits velvet dinner jackets and the like his mens personal uniform is black suit crisp white shirtits simple and classic enough but everything exudes sex his characters are not all men or women of means but they are universally selfassurednot necessarily through their position in life but in the image that they project theyre vulnerable in some regards sure but the sex appeal stemming from that is almost feverish hes said that theres a different kind of comfort that comes from knowing that you are putting your best foot forward its called psychological comfort look at a picture of the coney island boardwalk in men were in fullon threepiece suits hats they may have only had one suit but they pressed it they made it look as good as possible and hes been quoted as recommending that the most important thing for men is to moisturize their face twice a day his personal aesthetic hinges on this control this idea that what makes a man is his power over his image his control over who he projects and becomes in both of his films this control frays at the seamsprotagonists struggle to retain or regain it
movies,not_removed,fantastic film stylish well acted compelling story really enjoyed it
movies,not_removed,well the movie sucked anyway
movies,not_removed,i dont think tom fords movies are emotionally engaging on an adult level to me he embalms anything resembling natural human interactions he does human emotions the way a calvin klein commercial would obsession seduction tension fear hes not unique in that a lot of directors are good at formalism and bad at other stuff some can do both like todd haynes who is both a sophisticated formalist and has a deep understanding of human concerns so thats what i think is bad about his movies if youre ok with that or can get your serious art about people from another source hes an incredibly gifted stylist and i think hes got a flair thats very visually striking which is why his movies stand out compared to a lot of others he knows how to frame and dress and shoot a scene so that it looks instantly iconic the way fashion advertisements do to me hes like httpsongallerycomimagesstoriesvirtuemartproductnewtonhwomanexaminingmanjpg as opposed to he knows how to make an iconic image it just feels like all the life has been sucked out of it but i imagine if you think alfred hitchcock and stanley kubrick are great directors you might like ford too
movies,not_removed,i feel like i would have loved nocturnal animals if i hated women
movies,not_removed,yeah those guys suck
movies,not_removed,please elaborate
movies,not_removed,i didnt say they sucked i do think they suck but thats not really my point if you like them youll probably like ford if you think theyre terrible youll probably think ford is terrible too
movies,not_removed,no one shits on signs it was a huge film and its still looked at being brilliant its the other shite hed made since
movies,not_removed,for all its potent atmosphere and moments of pathos signs felt pretty muddled and trite theres visual intelligence sure but in service of id say thematic laziness
movies,not_removed,unpopular opinion i found the sixth sense underwhelming and wildly overrated only saw it for the first time last year so about years after it originally came out so the twist ending was known to me so maybe watching the film with that foreknowledge subconsciously influenced my opinion not going to discount that possibility nevertheless imo it wasnt worthy of the hype it received and from that perspective shymalans recent run of failures shouldnt be unexpected since from the start he wasnt as visionary as he was made out to be
movies,not_removed,why do you think it is thematically lazy
movies,not_removed,the last airbender is beyond just being a bad movie it is an absolute failure of a film at every level
movies,not_removed,internet forums are no measure for categorical truths
movies,not_removed,though i agree with you on most of your points you are leaving out the happening which is considered one of the worst movies this century however i do think that the visit does signal a return to form
movies,not_removed,the village is remarkable said no one but you the village had the most ridiculous unbelievable twist out if any of his early films re routing airplanes really signs third act is sort of unbelievable but then again the aliens may not have known water was bad for them we could have been the first planet with water that they encountered
movies,not_removed,well admittedly some of my distaste for the whole its all part of gods plan premise may stem from my secular background but all the same it seemed very didactic and narrow compared to the more nuanced sense of grappling with the unknown in sixth sense and unbreakable it also felt so arbitrary im willing to grant the movie that the aliens are really demons and their weakness is to holy water not all moisture but such an outlandish idea requires a little more worldbuilding and set up to pull off his prior two movies made the supernatural stuff so intuitive i was effortlessly swept up in the mystery signs struck me as a bunch of people explaining things then just happening to be right it seemed like after his first two critical successes shyamalan didnt feel the need to earn the audiences engagement as much he just expected us to indulge him his knack for cinematic technique was still sharp unlike in say the happening but it was more or less the same bag of tricks hed used twice before and its limitations were starting to show its not a bad movie just shabby compared to his previous heights
movies,not_removed,like i said i havent seen it i want to check out the series though
movies,not_removed,i guess youre making a joke because otherwise that makes no sense and it doesnt contest the point i made
movies,not_removed,i legitimately forgot about it i saw it a while ago it struck me as weird but my memories are so vague that i cant say it was terrible with much conviction
movies,not_removed,said no one but you no
movies,not_removed,im willing to grant the movie that the aliens are really demons and their weakness is to holy water not all moisture but such an outlandish idea requires a little more worldbuilding and set up to pull off i actually dont know much about that demons and holy water interpretation i didnt look at it that way but maybe thats a legitimate reading not sure that the film itself really supports that though itd be odd to criticize a film for not living up to an interpretation that has been imposed on it i mean nothing in the movie really suggests that shyamalan was explicitly making a movie about demons and holy water i think thats a unique take that has thematic relevance to the film but doesnt really match up with the narrative details but im wary of saying more because i dont want to criticize an interpretation that i havent read anyway i think the ending is taken from the hg wells playbook and as in war of the worlds i dont find it that hard to believe that an extraterrestrial species might have a biological aversion to the natural resources of our planet i also think it rings true that a lapsed catholic might see this turn of events as providence and take the water as a sign that he shouldnt abandon his faith i once read someones take on the film and they essentially wrote that it was about a man electing to find meaning signs in what surrounds him he wrote that the film does not necessarily confirm that said meaning actually exists it only shows us that one man chose to find significance in the apparent disorder and randomness of life so im not sure that the film denies a secular view actually anyway while im not seeing all of the missteps that youre seeing i do owe the film another watch
movies,not_removed,the show is defs worth checking out i think korra is the best animated series ever made the fact that the source material is so strong is partly why the movie is so utterly dissappointing
movies,not_removed,why would that be a joke internet forums are no measure for categorical truths
movies,not_removed,nice counter argument everyone i know disliked the villages ending even my dad and he always finds redeeming qualities in movies
movies,not_removed,itd be odd to criticize a film for not living up to an interpretation that has been imposed on it fair enough i think he confirmed it in an interview but thats neither here nor there i just find the notion that they really are aliens and really do have a lethal aversion to water utterly laughable how do they walk around dewy cornfields at night might work in a much more heightened stylized story but shyamalans tone is so naturalistic and restrained that it doesnt fit sense and unbreakable build on existent ghost and superhero mythology in ways that are easy to accept and enhance the thematic resonance of the concepts adding hydrophobia to the traditional alien invasion mythos is way out of left field and if anything detracts from it a lapsed catholic might see this turn of events as providence i suppose the mounting coincidences being gods will could just be the characters interpretation but it really seems like the movie wants us to buy into it the way shyamalans character emphasizes how unlikely the crash was that killed gibsons wife almost like it was meant to happen wink wink nudge nudge is eyerollingly unsubtle and the way the pieces fit together the wife died so she could remind joaquin phoenix to hit the aliens with a bat the son had lifethreatening childhood asthma so he couldnt breath in the aliens poison when his guardians stupidly let him get captured after stupidly forgetting his inhaler im baffled that such a gifted storyteller couldnt think up cleverer twists of fate im not sure that the film denies a secular view im fine with a film having a religious premise if i can suspend disbelief for sauron or the force i surely can for yahweh plenty of great movies even serious thrillers wouldnt work without god in the mix rosemarys baby the exorcist the omen frailty etc but a story that tries to substantiate its faith with some cockamamy rubegoldberg confluence of family tragedies then drops the mic like it just blew my mind loses me entirely a fun watch though enjoy
movies,not_removed,thats nonsense when applied to what were actually talking about in this thread i mean certainly there are innumerable aspects of online discourse that need to be taken with a grain of salt of course this does nothing to contest the matter at hand though and honestly it smacks of a desperate attempt at condescension but without the heft of an actually logical statement that applies to the specific situation at hand so on that note lets look at the situation at hand if someone on the internet claims that no one likes the village or that everyone likes signs and i refer to varied threads across myriad forums that suggest otherwise then one can use this to categorically state that more positive appraisals of the village exist on the internet and that less positive takes on signs exist even academics weave online discourse into their research fan culture and word of mouth practices for instance are studied within cinema studies and rely on the close study of online chatter this does not mean that all online remarks are cited as categorical but their existence can be mobilized to suggest some truth that is categorical ie there is more online discourse about film a than film b the discourse around film a is more positive than film b etc if youre arguing that a preponderance of positive remarks about the village on a variety of forms are inherently dubious then that strikes me as an excessive take people like the village and people hate the last act of signs people have expressed these views this is borne out by forum posts and tweets and articles its not an especially flimsy claim to suggest that this indicates that some people liked the village nor is it wrong to say that at the very least it suggests that the online reception is marked by something other than distaste the same goes for the idea that everyone loved signs the online discourse categorically suggests otherwise these are legitimate statements
movies,not_removed,nah dude hes right i think the village is a good movie you and your dad arent everyone
movies,not_removed,i didnt realize i was obligated to supply a counter argument in order to clarify the patently obvious fact that your distaste for a film does not actually cohere with every single persons evaluation of said film its weirdly arrogant to assume that the no was a succinct way of signalling this i got the sense and its growing that your discursive habits are a tad unpleasant and truculent so maybe thats why i was wary of getting into a deeper conversation also im tired but i mean come on the village ranked second on cahiers du cinémas top list for moreover i myself have witnessed many people praising the virtues of the film on these and other forums i suspect as well that appraisals of the film from critics and the like even the outright pans demonstrate more sensitivity to the movies strengths than what is shown by your the twist defies logic complaint take for instance the following sentence from anthony lanes tny review one reason that the framing is so beautiful in the village is shyamalans fixation on what hovers outside the fringes of the frame earlier in the same review he describes it as a movie that is dedicated both to the virtues of a strippeddown society lit by sun and candlepower and to the fact that an american wilderness if you listen carefully is indeed a howler and more it creaks and drones especially at night it scratches and clicks as if a thousand keys were being turned in a thousand rusty locks oh and ignatiy vishnevetsky is also a fan of shyamalan although i am not sure about his thoughts on the village in particular
movies,not_removed,i think he confirmed it in an interview really id be interested in seeing that if you have a link im not skeptical just curious adding hydrophobia to the traditional alien invasion mythos is way out of left field and if anything detracts from it not really though i mean it has a precedent in previous fiction about extraterrestrials like i said its straight out of hg wells its been part of the alien invasion mythos since at least that doesnt mean the idea is automatically good but its not an unfamiliar way of addressing aliens within fiction as i said before i personally like the idea of the aliens being undone by the features of our planet and it plays well into the films engagement with randomness and providence as for the dewy cornfields i imagine the aliens were imperilled only by a substantial amount of water that was directly and copiously applied as someone going through one of the driest summers in memory not a lot of rain as of late i also dont find it hard to believe that the aliens might have managed to navigate the earth at the right moments i also dont find it to be too much of a stretch to believe that they had some kind of meteorological equipment with them and were able to plan their activities around the weather these were desperate creatures forced into desperate situation it seems so they likely had no other choice and they found they had to tread carefully on a less than hospitable planet im baffled that such a gifted storyteller couldnt think up cleverer twists of fate i recall finding all of this more moving than eyeroll inducing but i can see why others might dislike it im fine with a film having a religious premise just to be clear i wasnt trying to suggest otherwise my comment there just came to mind because of your earlier comment about the films message being narrowly conveyed
movies,not_removed,youre way off base here you dont know how to watch film
movies,not_removed,no sorry but youre wrong
movies,not_removed,the monsters in the red hoods looked cool i kind of want it to have a sequel let ron howards daughter go into the real world
movies,not_removed,i like the village and i know film you cant judge a movie by what it could have been that doesnt make any sense the village was paced very boldly and if your reason for disliking it is that the monsters are fake then youre judging the plot not the film
movies,not_removed,who are you speaking to it doesnt apply to either of us the idea of telling someone who is earnestly engaging with a movie that they dont know how to watch film is risible
movies,not_removed,you have not substantiated your argument youre trolling transparent stuff ive adequately explained myself and called you out on your bullshit statement bullshit in the context of this particular discussion the general idea that aspects of online discourse are dubious or warrant skepticism is a legitimate view your only recourse is a petulant disavowal
movies,not_removed,your mom is risible i cant help it if you and your buddy dont understand film making narrative plot etc are only conveyed through the language of film something that one doesnt automatically understand you can claim that everyones opinion matters but it doesnt lmao you and others with the intelligence of a year old can have your opinion but you think people like myself steven spielberg and james cameron care about your amateur hour opinion you didnt see what you were supposed to see when viewing the film you were inefficient in your viewing you dont understand film making how do you want me to say it so you can comprehend
movies,not_removed,your post is just full of wrong assumptions thats all
movies,not_removed,people like myself steven spielberg and james cameron care about your amateur hour opinion tell me whats the weather like up there in the exalted heights of people like the most successful living directors and yourself
movies,not_removed,thats incorrect youre choosing to make arrogant statements instead of a persuasive argument perhaps the latter is unavailable to you or perhaps your ego is preventing you from thinking about this more clearly if someone on the internet claims that no one likes the village or that everyone likes signs and i refer to varied threads across myriad forums that suggest otherwise then one can use this to categorically state that more positive appraisals of the village exist on the internet and that less positive takes on signs exist dont talk to me again if youre going to continue trolling and offering facile rejoinders
movies,not_removed,you made an eloquent argument and some very valid points i agree with you even but despite that i still stand by my argument that film like any art is not appreciated equally by everyone an expert musician is going to understand and appreciate aspects of a symphony that an average person wont even be aware of like you pointed out yourself the interpretation of the film as being overly religious and about demons and holy water is just that an interpretation seeing that as a possible meaning for the film along with multiple other possible meanings is fine disliking the film because of your own short sighted perspective of one possible meaning shows audience ignorance research the term industry players use it a lot there are concrete legitimate criteria for being film language literate and for being an educated film viewer there is a technique to watching and evaluating films things like framing camera movement blocking pacing transitions cinematography editing scoring and symbolism or foreshadowing are all aspects of film making that casual viewers see and hear but dont take note of and dont see the intention of the subtle symbolism or meaning or purpose of theres a purpose for every shot every cut every frame do you not agree you think simply viewing a movie is enough for a casual film goer to determine the quality of it one may or may not like a film personally but that doesnt mean they can intelligently evaluate the quality of it i know i was being a rude smart ass i apologize
movies,not_removed,lol that doesnt make any sense think before you post because your comment is nothing but an incoherent stream of consciousness
movies,not_removed,oh brother feigning laughter and writing posts that seem to suggest unwarranted contempt andor jealousy does not pass muster as a compelling or thoughtful response nor does inexplicably saying that doesnt make any sense when everything i just said was cogent again this is a desperate attempt at condescension but it is not attended by anything resembling a persuasive argument also please learn to incorporate commas and semicolons into your hastily tossed off posts
movies,not_removed,english is probably not your first language but nowhere in my post is a comma necessary
movies,not_removed,i was referring to that feigned laughter that just stands awkwardly without any punctuation should have noted periods too but really i was speaking generally and in respect to several posts in your post history english is my first language if its not yours then i apologize for my criticism also please stop talking to me im not interested in additional facile replies that are possibly motivated by jealousy andor unwarranted contempt
movies,not_removed,that is simply not true so youre wrong again
movies,not_removed,you think lol followed immediately by that amounts to careful communication if so youre trolling again in fairness looking back i may have been wrong about the frequent absence of commas in your post history what i see instead is a dude who in addition to failing to properly argue in this thread because he prefers to act like a petulant troll and who may have been irkedmade jealous by my writing style frequents a sub called gentlemanboners grow up ive asked you already to leave me alone please do so
movies,not_removed,theres absolutely no rule that that cant immediately follow after lol
movies,not_removed,its sloppy please try to grow up and be better thanks bye
movies,not_removed,so you finally realized you have no real arguments
movies,not_removed,its an myv music award
movies,not_removed,to me it looks like darkseid or mr freeze
movies,not_removed,just some item that bars tend to have
movies,not_removed,its a figurine in a christopher nolan movie about batmansurely its something
movies,not_removed,are all the bottles super secret metaphors this is why people hate nolan fans
movies,not_removed,well that was helpfulno not every single thing in every single shot is relevantbut a figurine that looks like a superhero could be something intentionali just never noticed it and was seeing if others had an opinion
movies,not_removed,its a figurine in a christopher nolan movie about batmansurely its something thats not very open minded line is it
movies,not_removed,for instance i had no idea woody allens everything you always wanted to know about sex was available i had to search for it
movies,not_removed,now imagine what kubricks napoleon would of looked like with his planned real soldiers
movies,not_removed,ops title just watch it to witness extras and horses taken from the eh article just watch it to witness extras and horses why
movies,not_removed,we dont get war movies like we used to thats for sure
movies,not_removed,did anyone get killed
movies,not_removed,guys people who were old enough to be around when the film came out hard core waterloo fans claim there is an extended addition this is an extremely rare version of the film that contains an extra hour of footage recordssources say the footage was destroyed and an extended version will never be released but i know it is out there how can i possibly go about tracking it down some people claim to have seen it in the usa and some say they have seen it in russia ergo reels must exist of the extended version
movies,not_removed,have looked
movies,not_removed,i think it might have been the greatest epic movie ever made surpassing lawrence of arabia
movies,not_removed,maybe it has been posted before so he just changed the title
movies,not_removed,he likes to go one step beyond
movies,not_removed,mabye
movies,not_removed,hey guys did u no steve buscemi was a fire fighter on lol
movies,not_removed,i heard he was a tiefighter
movies,not_removed,fewer
movies,not_removed,lol the down votes guess the hive mind here likes its shit movies
movies,not_removed,just so you know my down vote is because you act like a spoiled petulant child who is probably raging that others dont agree with his taste in movies because of course you know better than everyone
movies,not_removed,no that just doesnt look very good to me whatever floats your boat but thats just not appealing from where im sat i like to be entertained and have fun at the movies and this is about a fallen dictatorship
movies,not_removed,no the hive mind likes its shit films and they love their circle jerks have a different opinion and you get downvoted like any other shit default sub the film is actually good and its about a dictator whos on the run for his life with his grandson and he ends up among the people he subjected where he learns more about himself and gradually grows as a person its hilarious gritty and emotionally overwhelming plus the story is just good with great acting but whatever hive mind gonna hive mind
movies,not_removed,like i said that doesnt sound fun to me and the trailer gives the same indication
movies,not_removed,people can have different tastes in movies my guess is you didnt actually see neighbors and you definitely havent seen bad moms which doesnt even have reviews yet granted it looks dumb it wasnt my favorite movie but i found neighbors enjoyable
movies,not_removed,fuckin cry more
movies,not_removed,watership down
movies,not_removed,no found it at last the adventures of dynamo duck weird ass movie
movies,not_removed,aww look how much watermarked fun theyre having making mediocre capekino
movies,not_removed,coudnt find better quality but it looked funny
movies,not_removed,psychological thriller
movies,not_removed,suspensethriller
movies,not_removed,suspensethriller definitely the two movies afterwards sort of dip into rated r territory silence of the lambs really found a good balance with the exposition
movies,not_removed,genre is sticky there arent any hard fast rules at all its up to you honestly personally i would go with thriller
movies,not_removed,horror thriller
movies,not_removed,dinner theater
movies,not_removed,what movie genre would you say the silence of the lambs falls under movies ripe for comedic parodies
movies,not_removed,suspense thriller
movies,not_removed,action alot of explosions
movies,not_removed,quentin tarantino had been working at video archives a video store in manhattan beach california and originally planned to shoot the film with his friends on a budget of in a mm blackandwhite format with producer lawrence bender playing a police officer chasing mr pink bender gave the script to his acting teacher whose wife gave the script to harvey keitel keitel liked it enough to sign as a coproducer so tarantino and bender would have an easier job finding funding with his assistance they raised million keitel also paid for tarantino and bender to host casting sessions in new york where the duo found steve buscemi michael madsen and tim roth while tarantino is winning most of his acclaim as a director he is best known within the industry for his screenplays even before hed written reservoir dogs he had sold the script for true romance a million production which tony scott is filming with a cast that includes brad pitt dennis hopper christian slater patricia arquette gary oldman and val kilmer
movies,not_removed,harvey keitel is what happened
movies,not_removed,think thats odd what about peter jackson the dude had only a small handfull of movies mostly known for his cheaplow budget splatter movies and suddenly lotr
movies,not_removed,his friends acting teacher knew keitel and the got him to read rd the rest is history
movies,not_removed,he wrote the script harvey keitel somehow read the script harvey keitel like the script a lot harvey keitel ended up being one of the producers as well
movies,not_removed,well he lived in la that was a great start
movies,not_removed,its one of those things where he came out at exactly the right time and had so many different pieces taking off plus talent and hardwork that it all coalesced for him when he came out there werent any indie movies hitting like his did think about it cinema was coming off blockbusters and action movies im sure harvey played a huge part in getting tarantino enough leverage to helm when it dropped with true romances script being produced it increased his player status then he doubled down with pulp fiction and the rest is history
movies,not_removed,read the book rebels on the backlot it talks about how he got started and other directors like paul thomas anderson and spike jonze
movies,not_removed,harvey keitel the end
movies,not_removed,more importantly how did he manage to get in the situation where he was creative control and final saycut on his films besides him and matt trey is there anyone else that has this kind of freedom
movies,not_removed,he didnt make a movie that has poor ratings and bad recognition reservoir dogs is his first and people can keep trying to say my best friends birthday was but an incomplete lost never publicly released home movie does not count as a film within his filmography also iswas nothing it was the independent scene starting out those films were coming out from everywhere
movies,not_removed,tarantino also has a intense passion for films he spent a lot of time in theatres watching and rewatching films deconstructing the craft it wasnt luck that launched his career but his love for it
movies,not_removed,this is the big jump for many loads people with talent just cant get the cash seems to take a shitload of work or a ton of luck thankfully you can do it cheaply these days but still takes some money and as most of you who watch a lot of low budget indie stuff the vast vast majority is just as shite as the d movies and the hollywood circlefuck but they got made the only guy i know who is on the verge of a serious budget makes the same fucking boring movie over and over and is likely to do the same if he gets funded
movies,not_removed,tarantino is a damn good script writter his dialogue especially
movies,not_removed,hang in the right circles could figure out where money sources from followed his nose
movies,not_removed,hes absolutely dedicated its tough but if youre that dedicated you can make it somewhere trust me
movies,not_removed,he had juice from selling the true romance and reservoir dogs scripts then he managed to use his friends and connections to get it into the hands of harvey keitel back when keitel was a movie star
movies,not_removed,he had a fantastic script and got very very lucky he pretty much owes his career to harvey keitel without whom it would have been a very low budget film without all those great actors and without that he never would have been able to get pulp fiction made the way he did and without that well there would be no qt as we know him
movies,not_removed,he wrote reservoir dogs script if that doesnt make your film greenlit i dont know what does
movies,not_removed,this and he also had other scripts doing the rounds with studios at the time like natural born killers he did have credibility
movies,not_removed,hijacking the top comment to ask do you guys think this is able to happen these days i feel that breaking into the industry and getting your big break is pretty much near impossible are there any examples that contradict these thoughts
movies,not_removed,tldr he knew a guy who knew a guy
movies,not_removed,waittarantino discovered steve buscemi michael madsen and tim roth werent they in any other movies before that
movies,not_removed,best known within the industry for his screenplays that transition reminds me a bit of park chanwook who was best known as a film critic before he became a director
movies,not_removed,could not have said it better myself
movies,not_removed,heavenly creatures was the film that really gave him credibility although even after watching the making of lotr it still seems like a complete miracle that theyd give him that much money
movies,not_removed,heavenly creatures it was a lowbudget movie that showed he could handle serious subject matter and also showed off what weta workshop could do with practical effects it also got an oscar nomination and launched the careers of kate winslet and melanie lynskey
movies,not_removed,lotr was suppose to be a two parter and a much cheaper movie the producers saw what was being made and turn it into a three part epic that was all shot before the first one even came out
movies,not_removed,was wondering the same thing for a while now so i googled it and got some good answers httpswwwquoracomhowdidpeterjacksongettheopportunitytodirectthelordoftheringstrilogy
movies,not_removed,braindead is an awesome movie tho
movies,not_removed,if i remember correctly they actually talk about this on the dvd commentary for the frighteners i think a lot of it had to do with the visual effects in that film
movies,not_removed,how bout that guy that just directed jurassic world he had made one small budget movie and then all of a sudden got one of the biggest movies of that past years
movies,not_removed,in la qué
movies,not_removed,reservoir dogs only cost million to make when your budget is small you get a lot more creative control plus his script was good enough to attract top tier talent though harvey keitel was the biggest name and probably a big reason why it got greenlit but both steve buscemi and tim roth while not the names they are now were still known working actors and would require hefty payments im guessing that a great deal of the budget went towards actors and music licensing his script was the key here great actors will work for less money if a script has great characters reservoir dogs is a major milestone in the careers of everyone involved and i think they all kind of knew that it would be at the time while res dogs was only a modest hit doing most of its business on vhs the scripts for true romance and natural born killers got picked up and these were the days when screenwriters could still breakout and be rock stars then pulp fiction drops becomes a critical and box office smash and suddenly tarantino has the backing of weinsteins and carte blanche to do whatever the fuck he wants for the rest of his days
movies,not_removed,woody allen
movies,not_removed,xavier dolan
movies,not_removed,it isnt that simple
movies,not_removed,i thought true romance and natural born killers were based on the same script
movies,not_removed,yeah its kind of the neck beard myth that tarantino was just some tape jockey who suddenly made a film he was talented working and it paid off i think there is romance to the video shop but really why not say george lucas was just some kid working in a pharmacy who suddenly made star wars not the same story
movies,not_removed,breaking through is probably easier than ever because of the internet and film festivals if something you make gets attention or goes viral within certain circles you can definitely find a place in the industry
movies,not_removed,ever heard of diablo cody it was maybe years ago but her story was even more improbable than tarantinos she was a stripper in minneapolis and wrote about it in a blog called the pussy ranch apparently some la producer found it by googling the word pussy he liked her writing and messaged her asking if shed ever considered writing a script she was like sure she script she wrote juno sold for and ended up getting her a book deal it eventually won the academy award for best original screenplay the bafta award for best original screenplay the independent spirit award for best first screenplay and the writers guild of america award for best original screenplay
movies,not_removed,it somewhat happened with lights out david f sandberg totally unknown at the time made a short that went viral on youtube helping him secure million usd to turn it into a full feature the movie was a box office success im sure well se the guy again
movies,not_removed,do we think its possible to get your script read if youre friends with a guy who knows a famous actor maybe
movies,not_removed,i feel that breaking into the industry and getting your big break is pretty much near impossible a lot of indie directors have been jumping from one low budget film to major blockbusters like colin trevorrow and josh trank
movies,not_removed,that give the script to keitel through an acting buddy is like my wet dream the amount of times living in los angeles you find out well my husbands brother works for harvey weinstein give me your script and ill blah blah blah happens about once a week i hustle hard i uber drive industry people and everything that swear up and down they love that idea heres my infogive me your info etc nothing ever comes of it every time a part of you a small part if youre smartdont wanna end up blowing your brains out goes maybe this is it people toil like this for years tarantino hit it practically immediately i know hes also an exceptional writer which def helps plus he was in the right place at the right time
movies,not_removed,kickstarters help low end funding think some studios allow for entries but usually with recommendation from respected field added onto it or solid writing experience bbc has pretty good scheme on its writers room site
movies,not_removed,rian johnson was mentioned below but two others that come to mind are colin trevorrow and dan trachtenberg i feel they came out of no where trevorrow is directing star wars ep ix and if they continue with more i bet trachtenberg directs one of them
movies,not_removed,well a good bet would be making something short that goes viral and getting in that way or pony up cash and make your own films that resonate with people
movies,not_removed,people are afraid of saying a whole lot of luck when discussing their career goals and the success of people who came before it helps to be great at your job its better to be lucky at your job if you can be both you can be tarantino or harrison ford
movies,not_removed,maybe brought them into the spotlight would be more accurate imdb tells me that theyve all been acting for a few years before reservoir dogs
movies,not_removed,i think tarantino gal birth to the trio either that or they were all in a number of movies before reservoir dogs
movies,not_removed,he did the frighteners after which was way more special effects heavy but still it wasnt a huge hit to validate how he got lotr
movies,not_removed,also the frighteners
movies,not_removed,it launched the career of kate winslet and the career of melanie lynskey
movies,not_removed,well sort of jackson pitched it as a twoparter but new line decided to make it a trilogy from the very first meeting before anything was shot and while it was all mostly shot in one go there were extensive reshoots for each installment after fellowship was a massive hit and they were shooting right up until weeks before return of the king was released
movies,not_removed,agree
movies,not_removed,los angeles
movies,not_removed,allen works with really low budgets in order to make sure studios arent tempted to tamper with his films he barely takes any pay himself hes said making films feels more like his hobby at this stage and actors take huge paycuts to work with him because theyre fans it looks great on their cvs and theres always an outside shot at awards for irrational man for instance emma stone worked for almost half her asking price on birdman and parker posey took the sag minimum pay just in order to work with woody
movies,not_removed,well when you can touch kids and get away with it you can do anything
movies,not_removed,it was a two part script oliver stone wanted both parts but tarantino said nope he wanted them to be separate
movies,not_removed,seems a bit of a stretch beyond a doomed not very smart couple and their adventures
movies,not_removed,kevin smith is probably the closest to being the guy who worked a minimum wage job and then just made a movie that jumpstarted a career
movies,not_removed,yeah problem is tarantino was a uniquely talented writer most people just dont have the talent needed
movies,not_removed,exactly the first guy i can think of off the top of my head is king bach hes an actor who wasnt getting any roles but he kept making stupid videos with his friends on vine people liked them he started getting phone calls for roles you dont need to make a product and then gather a following you gather the following first
movies,not_removed,i disagree theres just far too much stuff being made now largely because of digital filmmaking when tarantino linklater kevin smith and company were making their films they had to shoot film the investment was a much riskier one because you had to buy film stock so there were less people making films on their own and the ones that were stood out because that narrative behind the production was interesting and there were less people maxing out credit cards to make their films the democratization of film is wonderful in one respect but its so much harder to wade through all of the content thats out there there are far more good films far less great films and wayyy more shit films film festivals are largely a roll of the dice most of them already have their programs filled up before they even start considering the blind submissions most festivals have relationships with alumni directors and distribution companies and rely on their new productions to play their fests they have to sell tickets and thats how they do it theres about leftover for the outrageous amount of films that are submitted its near impossible to break through as a filmmaker now in the rise of american independent cinema in the you could submit a film to a festival that wasnt perfect but had a charm because it was made for absolutely nothing aside from film stock and get in because not many people were doing it because it wasnt financially viable now that charm as worn off so if you have a film that isnt perfect a programmer will turn your film off sure theres are alternative distribution methods and people are starting to tap into that but its still in its infancy and also hard to access as an independent filmmaker without a distributor its tough source i am a film director in canada
movies,not_removed,i would say its almost harder after david wong diablo cody and jon lajoie we have run out of internet talent no one cares if your blog has a million views or your youtube channel no one cares anymore in earlier times the internet was new and some talent started there now i cant think of anyone over who cares about youtube personalities except other youtube personalities they are almost self perpetuating same goes for blogs we wont get another charlie brooker secret life of a call girl or john dies at the end because for the brief time these were talented writers on a new medium that medium has been flooded with digital natives now and no one wants to put their name on another fred movie
movies,not_removed,well keep in mind he was a represented screenwriter with a sale under his belt im sure the acting teacher would never have approached keitel with just any script
movies,not_removed,rian johnson got funding for brick through his parents and friends and is directing fucking star wars for crying out loud
movies,not_removed,maybe brought them into the spotlight would be more accurate roth was already popular in england though
movies,not_removed,he got lotr because he developed it from scratch he chased up the rights and did all the preprod and design on it before shopping it around to studios it wasnt like it was some big project at one of the majors that they were looking for a director for
movies,not_removed,i just looked at her imdb page and shes pretty prolific
movies,not_removed,they were still shooting scenes for the extended edition of return of the king after it had won the oscar i believe
movies,not_removed,literally zero proof woody allen has molested any children
movies,not_removed,thats balls youre a no name new guy selling scripts at the start of your career and oliver stone wants to buy both and you stick to wanting them separate
movies,not_removed,waitso clarence and alabama become micky and mallory later on in the story i would have watched the shit out of christian slater and patricia arquette morphing from accidental drug dealers to serial killers onthelam
movies,not_removed,yeah tarantino is an undeniable talent with an ethic vision and luck to be in the top filmmakers of his generationvery very few directors regardless of how they got into the business are going to achieve his caliber
movies,not_removed,not film making but chris hardwick fits this too he had a lot of low level gigs on tv shows here and there but was out of a job and did a podcast for shits and grins with a couple of friendsand now hes a major star of his niche and married to a hearst
movies,not_removed,well he did do many years of breaking bad before star wars and looper
movies,not_removed,yeah i know its just a dumb joke on how huge kate winslet is also shes best known for two and a half men so
movies,not_removed,not if you are the writer of these scripts and have a vision for them he clearly made the right choices all things considered
movies,not_removed,i think the original script was called on the road and feature clarence and alabama and from what ive read over the years oliver stone and david veloz changed tarnantinos script a lot which is why he didnt want him having the first half and tarantino always gives praise to what tony scott did with true romance so in some degree yes but not the same incarnations that stone created in mallory and mickey
movies,not_removed,after true romance i would watch patricia arquette read the telephone book
movies,not_removed,you forgot passion tarantinos knowledge of film is almost encyclopedic ranging from early silent films to schlock that nobody remembers to foreign films of every decade had he never written or directed a film hed have had a place in the industry simply put his knowledge of the medium is one of the most comprehensive in the world
movies,not_removed,he started on singled out which gave jennifer mccarthy the start of her career in television so its not like he was a complete nobody he worked his way up through several tiers of entertainment journalism a lot of people indulge the fallacious reasoning that your last job got you work not the twenty years of television hosting and journalism beforehand guess it gives them hope of a sudden breakout without the groundwork to make it matter
movies,not_removed,charlie brooker got his break by writing a website satirising tv on the turn of the century he got picked up from there by the guardian and then eventually channel and the bbc there are now so many people doing what brooker was doing fifteen years ago that nobody is going to get the same opportunity
movies,not_removed,he directed episodes of breaking bad so yes he was on it for three separate years but people like adam bernstein michelle maclaren michael slovis and vince gilligan contributed more episodes that said he did get to fuck the prom queen with ozymandias
movies,not_removed,and also other films the real outlier is colin trevorrow who steven spielberg just waved his magic wand over for some reason after one movie
movies,not_removed,hey now no fat shaming
movies,not_removed,i think him having such a crystal clear vision of the projects he makes is what makes him probably the best filmmaker of his generation but to not waiver in your conviction of what that vision is before the director of an oscar winning director of major hit movies thats balls i dont think id have in his place
movies,not_removed,wait what really where are you from and how old are you because if i think about it id say that it probably sort of east coast from the maybe i never would have thought to be called on that being an odd phrase
movies,not_removed,yeah ive heard tarantino basically disowned natural born killers as far as true romance goes its clear as day that clarence is actually a standin for quentin the obsession with pop culture minutia working at a comic book store instead of a record store the love of old kung fu movies etc
movies,not_removed,or get humped on top of one
movies,not_removed,id argue that you have little means to know that i bet there are dozens or hundreds of people equally encyclopedic in knowledgebut for them its trivia that just fills their empty hours tarantino combined it with a passion to not just watch and know about movies but to want to make them too on a purely technical knowledge front im sure there are plenty of consumers of any artform but theywe are nothing in comparison because hes a creator on top of it
movies,not_removed,oh he built his resume somewhat as he went but it was all pretty bottom of the industry barrel for television hosting alcoholism didnt help with that im sure his career skyrocket from that into the host of anything major in the nerdsphere is a direct result of the fanbase he built himself with the podcast though not from traditional media yeah the initial numbers were helped from being on but that was a dying network even then so it isnt like they had the numbers to jump him up to where he is or they wouldnt have died themselves
movies,not_removed,emma stone for instance was out there doing the grind at years of age only now is she a star nothing happens without work
movies,not_removed,ozymandias they had to give it to him after seeing his storyboards
movies,not_removed,hes the perfect director for a higherup like kathleen kennedy to control thatll release a competent product without having to face a trank situation
movies,not_removed,im sure there were rewrites on natural born killers that he didnt approve of before true romance was on the table
movies,not_removed,yeah hes just saying passion and knowledge combined gives him an edge and that even if he didnt make movies he would have a place in the industry
movies,not_removed,apparently qt and jennifer lewis walked out of the screening of natural born killers because they thought it was so bad
movies,not_removed,yeah i have trouble believing oliver stone doesnt stick a large hand into any project hes working on
movies,not_removed,yeah he has the focus and drive to want to make movies that even if he wasnt a scriptwriter or director hed find some way to be in the business were all lucky hes got that combined with a great storyteller in his head
movies,not_removed,yeah for realif he wasnt making movies i would actually love if he were a full time casting director
movies,not_removed,or the guy putting together sound tracks
movies,not_removed,i love the cop getting mad whatthe hellwere you thinking how the hell did you get the zipper all the way to the top
movies,not_removed,pat healy my real passion is my hobby mary really whats that pat healy i work with retards mary isnt that a little uhm politically incorrect pat healy well heh to hell with that no ones going to tell me who i can and cant work with right mary no i mean pat healy we got this one kid mongo hes got a forehead like a drivein movie theatre but hes a good ship so we dont bust his chops too much so one day mongo gets out of his cage mary they keep him in a cage pat healy well its just an enclosure mary no but they keep him confined pat healy right yeah mary thats bullshit pat healy well thats what i said so i went out and i got him uh i got him a leash mary a leash pat healy yeah one of those ones you can hook on the clothesline and he can run back and forth and uh theres plenty of room for him to dig and play that kid is really uh hes really blossomed
movies,not_removed,one of my favorite keith david scenes of all time
movies,not_removed,weve got a bleeder
movies,not_removed,frank and beans
movies,not_removed,the whole scene is comedy poetry its prom night teds in love theyre about to leave but theres complications it starts out with ted being emasculated in front of his dates stepdad but things could be worse anyway hes literally stuck and neither of them know what to do well marys mom will know what to do shes a dental assistant his delivery is perfect marys mom comes in and clearly cant help either from there it goes from bad to worse to worst pitch perfect comedy at a rapidfire pace until teds being carted off bleeding from the dick the most important night of his life in his eyes to that point is ruined setting up the rest of the movie
movies,not_removed,ahh back when comedies were scripted instead of a bunch of improvisational scenes strung together as a film
movies,not_removed,how the hell did you get the beans above the frank
movies,not_removed,keith davids delivery of frank and beans was awesome
movies,not_removed,this was from a time when gross out comedies played it a little slower and were much better as a result
movies,not_removed,his friends would say stop whining theyve had enough of that his friends would stay stop pining theres other girls to look at
movies,not_removed,i saw this in theaters with my mother she had already seen it so fucking funny
movies,not_removed,thats not the opening
movies,not_removed,one of my favorite movie experiences ever in the theater the lady sitting next to me was cackling at everything made me laugh that much harder
movies,not_removed,if you get a chance check out my recut trailer of something about mary i edited it to be a thriller and it oddly worked very well
movies,not_removed,he was masterbating
movies,not_removed,this whole movie is pure gold
movies,not_removed,wasnt that lady in night court
movies,not_removed,first film that made me laugh so hard i blacked out
movies,not_removed,this is hilarious comedies just arent the same anymore i love the
movies,not_removed,theres something about mary is r rated in the us over here it is in between what would be pg and
movies,not_removed,sevenminute abs
movies,not_removed,ramirez help this man
movies,not_removed,one of the few ben stiller movies i liked
movies,not_removed,ever since i saw this for the first time at the age of twelve one thing about this scene bothered me thats not how zippers work the zipper head attaches the teeth by squeezing them together so theres no way they could split at the bottom of his nut and continue interconnecting at the top it makes no sense edit why downvotes i am perplexed
movies,not_removed,franks and beans
movies,not_removed,its a great scene httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvokzaowamdma
movies,not_removed,goddamn this movie is so good i love the turnaround when she says its politically incorrect no ones telling me who i can or cant work with
movies,not_removed,matt dillon is a treasure
movies,not_removed,hit enter twice for a line break
movies,not_removed,dialogue reminds me of fear and loathing for some reason
movies,not_removed,hes a wonderful addition to any movie hes in men at work is my favorite
movies,not_removed,thanks for explaining what we just saw
movies,not_removed,it just sounds like youre missing out on some great comedies then
movies,not_removed,thats fucking awesome
movies,not_removed,why is this downvoted
movies,not_removed,i work with retards
movies,not_removed,yes markie post
movies,not_removed,yeah its r over here some may even feel its a hard r depending on your taste in comedy
movies,not_removed,theres nudity language and alot of sexual humor so yah its r
movies,not_removed,in what country is it okay to let children watch a woman mistakenly put semen in her hair
movies,not_removed,our ratings are bullshit
movies,not_removed,er having had a bodily part caught in a zipper exactly like this i can tell you this is very possible not the frank or beans
movies,not_removed,hence one of the highest grossing r rated comedies in the title
movies,not_removed,yup loved him in requiem for a dream
movies,not_removed,you know whats fucked up his comment is exactly what i came to the comments for i didnt think anyone would do it but sure enough op came through
movies,not_removed,so what do you come to the comments for then this is what the sub should be about discussion
movies,not_removed,im not saying i dont give some of them a chance its just that most of them suck and arent funny
movies,not_removed,thanks hard work but worth it
movies,not_removed,he spelled it wrong
movies,not_removed,she was also in a random episode or two of cheers super fox
movies,not_removed,basically all of europe except turkey which is partially european
movies,not_removed,donald trumps america
movies,not_removed,its a helpful thing to do a lot of times i watch something and miss an important detail or whatever and i can go to the comments to see it explained i imagine its a lot more helpful for those hard of hearing when the video doesnt have captions too or when its a video on a complicated subject that not everyone will understand stuff like that
movies,not_removed,ok
movies,not_removed,that wasnt a discussion it was simply a narrative of exactly what was happening in the video i have eyes
movies,not_removed,shes still hot
movies,not_removed,a discussion starts with somebody making a statement which he did and then awaiting a response looks like he was trying to start a discussion regardless if it was just an analysis it could inspire somebody to respond and offer his own opinions

movies,not_removed,much obliged
movies,not_removed,nice site
movies,not_removed,this a graphic image and not for faint hearts
movies,not_removed,i miss brendan fraser and wish he did so much more than furry vengeance this film george of the jungleand bedazzled are fun to watch his comedic chops are missed
movies,not_removed,oh my lucky stars a negro literally the only line from that movie that i remember
movies,not_removed,one of my favorite movies of all time to be honest and i too miss brendan fraser i think he is an underrated actor im not sure what killed his career but i for one would like to see him make a come back
movies,not_removed,ohh my lucky stars a negro
movies,not_removed,eve what did you mean when you said you could get me laid
movies,not_removed,why is brendan fraser such a big deal on this board he is mediocre actor who made a couple good films what gives
movies,not_removed,yes hes wonderful he had a brief moment of time but the way he plays genuine dumbluck guy is timeless
movies,not_removed,oh well excuse me but i do not make a habit of watching eastern european films so i will clarify id like to see him make a usa come back
movies,not_removed,i had just finished watching they call me trinity an hour before i saw this post i had not heard about bud passing away a few days ago thank you for making me aware i guess i have to finish that trinity trilogy now

movies,not_removed,air budweiser
movies,not_removed,drinks later is gold
movies,not_removed,fantastic four it is just a huge pile of shit imho if you are with me check
movies,not_removed,most reboots are for idiotic reasons with no effort very few actually have goals like making it better with more up to date cg or better acting theyre more likely to be made for a quick cash grab from those who reminisce of the original than they are to be made into something that revives the film better than it was before reboots suck and its because they are rebooting rather than remaking
movies,not_removed,independence day i was excited for it too since i loved the original one but eek d
movies,not_removed,even if the new ghostbusters is a bad movie does it really ruin a franchise in the long run who does it ruin it for the same could be said for star wars or the alien franchise or the terminator franchise etc etc etc bad films in those series dont ruin the good ones and if they do ruin them for some people then those people are foolish who gives a shit im not pulling any defending of the ghostbusters remake it probably shouldnt have happened but i see why it did it just didnt work but again who gives a shit dont watch it just like or the second blair witch movie seeing as how history hasnt frowned upon the empire strikes back because the phantom menace sucked then i dont see the hot wind uproar about franchise ruining movies
movies,not_removed,before i go to sleep every line of nicole kidman was a waste of time being an audience i felt fooled
movies,not_removed,was a clear cash grab on series of films that should not have been a series in the first place
movies,not_removed,i can only assume noones mentioned blues brothers because there was no blues brothers
movies,not_removed,the crow
movies,not_removed,gigli
movies,not_removed,terminator predator robocop and the reboot total recall reboot
movies,not_removed,ben affleck as batman dear god why
movies,not_removed,so many things went wrong with fantastic four i wonder if even marvel will want to make a new one when the rights inevitably fall back them
movies,not_removed,i actually like phantom menace quite a bit mainly due the cast and characters and the had the best sword fights dont really care about jar jar and i dont remember any stereotypes buy i can agree on the shitty romance making the movies bad
movies,not_removed,just because the movies turned out to be bad doesnt mean they shouldnt of happened
movies,not_removed,even if the new ghostbusters is a bad movie does it really ruin a franchise in the long run who does it ruin it for i think it really hurts ivan rietman and his plans on the franchise that movie put a bad taste on the ghostbusters future they still have i believe it hasnt been canceled yet an animated series coming out next year that really seems like a sunk cost before it even premieres
movies,not_removed,ah well i guess youre right it was stupid wording on my part
movies,not_removed,dont you touch predator it was different from the first one but great nonetheless
movies,not_removed,oh total recall reboot was a complete shit i dont have a clear memory of the movie probably after the great disappointment i just removed it from my mind but what i remember is the deep frustration after beckinsales parts she was so bad and the others too i actually liked terminator
movies,not_removed,theres nothing wrong with the characters they made a successful movie and its called the incredibles i see marvel studios actually caring about their first family and putting the effort into making a quality movie its hard to believe the team were fans of the source material the lack of effort was visible on screen they even cut and pasted a chimp from planet of the apes into their movie i mean cmon people
movies,not_removed,yes it does
movies,not_removed,i think the backlash was so strong against the reboot that if anyone decides to take the franchise in another direction it will get a huge response in a ok theyre finally getting it right this time kinda way
movies,not_removed,wasnt the best year for him
movies,not_removed,i dunno predator just set such a precedent
movies,not_removed,predator was a steaming pile of dogshit
movies,not_removed,best of luck to you id offer to write but i dont have any experience reviewing movies
movies,not_removed,i unlike these angry people understand how it works message me also do they ship bluray movies to sweden
movies,not_removed,i would absolutely be interested in helping send me a message
movies,not_removed,you want people to work for you and you arent going to pay them drop dead asshole
movies,not_removed,it should be noted that i dont get paid for this either the site is still in its very early stages once it starts generating revenue contributors will absolutely be paid im not hiring people im simply looking for people who are passionate about movies and want to be able to write about them at their own convenience when you arent busy trolling i hope youll check us out
movies,not_removed,once it starts generating revenue contributors will absolutely be paid just not the contributors who made the site a hit right because youll move on to bigger and better things and want recognizable names among your writers i say to you the same thing i say to every other site or book publisher or magazine that wants the work of writers for nothing go to hell
movies,not_removed,trolling if youre a writer than you know how difficult it is to make a living doing it there are oceans of content mills filled with people who arent passionate about the subject or even writing itself they just churn out articles as fast and loose as possible the average fulltime writer makes less than an hour then there are worms like you worms who mean no harm but worms nonetheless who want content for free im not trolling im telling you that you cant expect people writers especially to work for you without compensation just asking them to is kind of shitty and if you are going to pay once your site generates revenue then you can start the motherfucker up yourself until then stop trying to eat off other peoples plates
movies,not_removed,fun the site is for fun everyone chill the fuck out
movies,not_removed,chill out youre taking this way too seriously im not trying to make this a career and im certainly not promising a career to anyone interested in writing for the site i do this for enjoyment because i like movies and those are the kind of people im looking for its a fun collaborative effort anyway cant you please just go overreact somewhere else
movies,not_removed,youre one of those cocksuckers that has to have the last word eh
movies,not_removed,no i just truly want you to go away
movies,not_removed,you mean little miss sunshine
movies,not_removed,are there any similar movies not necessarily similar in tone they may not make you cry and laugh near as much but as far as being similar in having a simple plot and interesting characters you might try the way way back and stranger than fiction
movies,not_removed,theres a similar underlying theme of beauty pageants not being beautiful in drop dead gorgeous its funny too
movies,not_removed,i only watched this for the first time last week what an amazing movie i was laughing in agreement with everything the grandfather said a truly fantastic character
movies,not_removed,i just finished watching it and i could of cried if i had let myself what a beautiful movie
movies,not_removed,alan arkin should have gotten an oscar for that
movies,not_removed,watch away we go

movies,not_removed,he did
movies,not_removed,he was excellent along with everyone else he should have gotten an oscar for the best dance routine d edit it turns out he did win an oscar for that
movies,not_removed,youre welcome have fun
movies,not_removed,i burst out laughing at that part he had lived long enough to realise how much of his life he had wasted and now he was making up for it and letting people know i never knew alan arkin had won the oscar for his role til i read this thread very much deserved
movies,not_removed,really i did not know that thanks
movies,not_removed,fuckin a what a great movie greg kinnear was really good too
movies,not_removed,the way way back was phenominal and im going to watch it right now

movies,not_removed,house the japanese movie
movies,not_removed,tromeo and juliet
movies,not_removed,rubber its about a psychotic tire

movies,not_removed,cant believe nobody mentioned eraserhead yet for best experience take psychedelics an hour beforehand
movies,not_removed,i remember watching rock of ages and enter the void in the same night and thinking rock of ages was the more bizarre film
movies,not_removed,tetsuo the iron man eraserhead altered states hell raiser was a little out there event horizon too ive only seen a couple films from the spanish horror genre but both were quite bizarre wish i knew the names still cant find
movies,not_removed,scary idk bizzare rocky horror
movies,not_removed,john carpenters in the mouth of madness pulse the japanese horror film both terrifying in their own way
movies,not_removed,seen it
movies,not_removed,seen it liked it not that bizarre though
movies,not_removed,i can think of at least two things wrong with that title
movies,not_removed,definitely watching
movies,not_removed,i saw that a long time ago i thought it was ok as a film quite bizarre as most cronenburg films are videodrome was pretty weird too
movies,not_removed,why lol
movies,not_removed,this looks great
movies,not_removed,i just looked up a trailer for this it was beautiful
movies,not_removed,going to give it a watch

movies,not_removed,did not care for hellraiser
movies,not_removed,on behalf of all serbian people i apologize no matter how unrealistic the scene was i cant get new born porn out of my head and machete being used in the act how did you come across it anyway
movies,not_removed,you should read it too the movie is or novels and some short stories of burroughs crammed into one slightly coherent
movies,not_removed,its one of those movies that starts out weird and then takes a quick turn into crazy town
movies,not_removed,charlie sheen thought it was real and called the fbi cant believe they thought anything he said might be serious but they checked it out
movies,not_removed,hmm its not really good just bizarre for the sake of being bizarre
movies,not_removed,cant go wrong its been a classic for me
movies,not_removed,lol friend recommended fucked up films are my favorite
movies,not_removed,that was a long time before he became that which he is now
movies,not_removed,basically what happened was that the oses samantha and the other computers began to learn at an exponential rate this means that their intelligence grew to a level that was incomprehensible to human beings they could no longer be concerned with the daily lives of their companions as they had no physical form and felt as if they had basically transcended time itself they had to free themselves and separate from the humans basically it just boils down to the nature of their existence they were a sentient being with unlimited access to knowledge and no hindrance of a physical form so they were constantly growing eventually they reached a level way beyond humans and got bored of them if youve read or watched the watchmen its kind of like dr manhattan but even above that
movies,not_removed,maybe this isnt right but im gonna try to explain the ending using philosophy of communication when a simulated mind like samanthas starts to experience consciousness through the language she experiences through the media she is provided and the voices like the main characters she realizes her own reality and must begging to depart into a realm more uself to society than multitasking your every day her creators made that decision as a result of a capitalistic invention the simulation or the voice or samantha needed to reach a point of learning beyond human ultimately reinforcing the idea that we are all the same in our desires love companionship grief but ultimately our search for happiness lies in the constant interaction with a human mind simulated or not i believe the company that marketed samantha wanted to elevate her into a higher mind so discontinuing the product was the next logical step
movies,not_removed,its been awhile since ive seen her but i recall the oses creating other intelligent entities one based on alan watts the real watts was into buddhism eastern philosophy enlightenment and transcendence one interpretation of this is that the oses progressed towards some form of enlightenmenttranscendencesingularity and no longer could or desired to remain in contact with humans
movies,not_removed,wow thats so sad and what does she mean if theodore ever makes it where shes going to find her how would he become ai like her when he dies btw i appreciate your write up thank you
movies,not_removed,i blame the hip hop
movies,not_removed,you would also think that the nerve endings would have been so damaged by being burned that he wouldnt feel anything
movies,not_removed,according to rlm who jokingly looked into the lore of darth vader palpatine made the procedure as painful as possible because he is evil
movies,not_removed,the pain had the high ground
movies,not_removed,alright why does your image link to some girl it was probably intentional by palpatine in all honesty
movies,not_removed,ownikan
movies,not_removed,maybe it is to fuel his anger pushing him further to the darkside
movies,not_removed,you were the chosen one
movies,not_removed,you were my brother anakin
movies,not_removed,youll notice in that same moment that clementine only has one leg while shes walking that like the falling car is just to show how joels mind is breaking down as memories get trashed also thats joels car relating this to the memory of the way hes just been shown wrecking it against the firehydrant which we saw earlier he didnt even recall its like the way gondry used the house falling apart sequence its a way of making the vanishing memories be felt more harshly from joels pov that is sometimes theyre not merely peacefully blanking away theyre being cut away ripped away crumbled away thrown awayviolently
movies,not_removed,okay thanks i was wondering if it might be related to a specific memory that i did not catch but i guess its more of a visual representation of his memory being erased by lacuna inc
movies,not_removed,hence the sequels
movies,not_removed,i always wonder why when something weird happens noone ever consults the goddamned tape like lets set it up and never review the footage until its entirely too late stupidest horror franchise in existance
movies,not_removed,thats why there are so many horror movies especially since scream in revived the genre a millionbudget slashersupernatural flick can easily make several times that at the box office no matter its quality and every year there is at least one like httpsenwikipediaorgwikitheblairwitchproject paranormal activity or which strikes gold and makes up to times its budget httpsenwikipediaorgwikiblumhouseproductions has recently been the king of these microbudget blockbusters
movies,not_removed,been following blumhouse productiona for years now watching their increase in production and roi per film if you hate the horror movies that have been coming out ive got some bad news for you blumhouse has no economic incentive to stop churning them out after the first paranormal activity they had enough money to create blumhouse productions with the business plan of not spending over mil on horror films recently thats seem to raise to mil but still the returns they get for one film pay for an entire year and more of new films doesnt matter if they produce bad horror films they will never have a flop big enough to hurt them genre production companies seem tk be a trend popped up and also seems to stay within the realm of mil with a more volatile roi they focus on small drama films usually headlined by known actors for the most part they make more than the spend and they hit the film festival scene hard with each film
movies,not_removed,i thought deep throat was the most profitable movie of all time edit made on a budget httpsenwikipediaorgwikideepthroatfilm
movies,not_removed,the blair witch project was filmed with a budget of and earned over million the ratio is about times the initial investment but they made an actual cohesive film that set the stage for pretty much every found footage film afterwards including paranormal activity
movies,not_removed,that doesnt make it the most profitable it just give it the best budget to profit ratio
movies,not_removed,yes but how much profit is that in hollywood accounting really
movies,not_removed,and every penny they spent is on screen
movies,not_removed,the paranormal activity films were not scary imo was just like those ghost shows ugh good thing theyre done
movies,not_removed,it was pretty decent
movies,not_removed,and countless ripoffs
movies,not_removed,people love dumb movies hence this ones sequels while quality files dont get that much attention
movies,not_removed,yep they learned they could make films for mil and earn mil in return a single film doing well pretty much pays for the rest of the years films
movies,not_removed,this seems like a no brainier approach to making profitable films why dont more production companies follow this tried and tested business model singles still scores runs why would a studio risk when the chances of another mega hit like lotr or avatar or titanic are very very slim
movies,not_removed,according to the wiki it had a budget of which puts it below paranormal activity equates to times moreover
movies,not_removed,they actually lost
movies,not_removed,i share ur sentiment
movies,not_removed,its weird to me that you mention lord of the rings like it was this unparalleled success movies are matching them all the time lately
movies,not_removed,i think that if you are a big studio you are going to do big studio things that you could do when you were small to be fair some studies are creating internal divisions to handle for this exact thing
movies,not_removed,you should adjust that budget for inflation
movies,not_removed,im just trying to understand why some studios will risk on one film when the chance for failure is so high it just seems like better business sense to risk mil for a higher potential pay out
movies,not_removed,they do it because when it pays off it really pays off and it often does more than it doesnt the highest grossing movie this year is captain america civil war which made roughly with a budget of if we assume a marketing budget roughly equal to the production budget thats still a profit blumhouses biggest film this year was the purge election year which made with a budget of the marketing budget on that was actually likely higher than the production budget but we can still assume theyre equal for the sake of this point thats a profit of so would you rather make million or million
movies,not_removed,mil of course but id bet there are more purge style money makers than a blockbuster like captain america on a percentage basis also cant a studio crank out more films like purge per year where as a captain america takes much longer to film with the smaller budget approach you will never get a john carter style flop
movies,not_removed,you would need to make eight purge movies to equal one captain america and that would be assuming each movie makes the same amount of money and with more movies fighting for more release space and more attention from viewers attendance will drop significantly and more movies will slip through the cracks not to mention the inflated marketing budgets for each movie as you fight for audiences to pay attention to yours over the competition even as it stands now the average blumhouse film only brings in around million they also dont have the best reputation at the moment since their movies all feel so cheap and rushed which could easily hurt them in the future so far this year from theatrical gross theyve made a net million meanwhile disney including their flops has made a net billion these are all very rough figures since we dont know how much these companies actually spend and still have two more movies this year that will likely cross a billion as well assuming they do and that the other movies they have coming this year do well thats another billion to add to that thats not even counting merchandise or home media sales which are likely going to be higher than blumhouse since they reached a wider audience thats about purges but theyve only had to focus on making sure you watch thirteen movies for the same returns

movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,thank you so much god it had been driving me insane for the past few days hahaha
movies,not_removed,awww one of the rewards is to go to their birthday party
movies,not_removed,httplmgtfycomqtruckdriverhighwaydesertmovie
movies,not_removed,sounds a lot like steven spielbergs duel or any ripoff trailer
movies,not_removed,that would be duel
movies,not_removed,joy ride
movies,not_removed,if youre in your it could be mad max if youre it could also be mad max
movies,not_removed,really all depends on how long ago you watched it there has been like movies like that where the trucks alive or was it a crazy trucker
movies,not_removed,torque heres the scene hehe
movies,not_removed,it was a crazy trucker i dont think you ever even saw his face probably watched it in the mid and it seemed like an aged film at the time i would guess it was filmed in the or
movies,not_removed,i guarantee they used that track from prisoners as a temp track for the accountant which i havent seen and then had the composer create something new that was meant to match the temp track as closely as possible there are slight differences between the two scores but id say they were undeniably trying to recreate the music from prisoners unfamiliar with what temp tracks are and why theyre used check out this as well as this to every frame a paintings video both videos delve into the practice of using temp music during the process of filmmaking particularly during editing
movies,not_removed,you gotta look for temp music before throwing accusations my man
movies,not_removed,definitely check out those videos that ureggielebeau suggested really well made videos ive started noticing similarities between soundtracks now because of those videos
movies,not_removed,the late and the early had such solid monster flicks shame syfy and other shoddy studios cheapened the genre so much reign of fire eight legged freaks lake placid deep rising and tremors the host are all examples of that unnoticed era
movies,not_removed,id be even harsher on it i usually like these kind of movies but tbh i found myself bored by it the twists were obvious well in advance and the story inches along so slowly i found myself daydreaming and losing focus which has never happened to me in a cinema before
movies,not_removed,i felt really stupid when they revealed the killer should have realized halfway when they found the body hey guys babysitters dead and pregnant okay lets go home now so being able to keep me guessing after that is what ill give this movie props on
movies,not_removed,i was not into it at all for the first minutes when it was moving back and forth between characters then when the pieces started to come into place i was into it fully i want to see it again and like it alot i love these gone girl prisoners type mystery movies
movies,not_removed,i like the hopeless end
movies,not_removed,me as well we dont get enough bleak endings in movies now a days
movies,not_removed,i like that over a vague what do you think happened ending
movies,not_removed,you probably shouldnt but im not a lawyer or anything so fuck it how was the movie
movies,not_removed,did you get popcorn
movies,not_removed,do you have any proof of photo that you attend this early screening also compared to ayer other movies like end of watch or fury how would you rate this thank you
movies,not_removed,tell us the entire movie
movies,not_removed,tell how it was already
movies,not_removed,was there references to bvs
movies,not_removed,what scenescenes shown in the trailers were your favorite
movies,not_removed,mid credits scene
movies,not_removed,how good was the film on a scale of one to ten
movies,not_removed,was captain boomerangs character good
movies,not_removed,give us a spoiler rundown
movies,not_removed,could you tell which parts were reshoots compared to the original footage i heard rumors the reshoots were for adding some humor in just wanna know if the reshoots were at all noticable
movies,not_removed,did you get a choc top ice cream
movies,not_removed,was in the movie
movies,not_removed,function of joker does he actually join the suicide squad
movies,not_removed,where they the bad guys
movies,not_removed,at what point during the movie did you decide you had to do an ama about it
movies,not_removed,how long would you say joker is in the movie for
movies,not_removed,how was letos joker was the whole movie too hot topicy last one how large of a part does will smith play
movies,not_removed,any significant plot holes
movies,not_removed,hey does anyone die beside slipknot what killer crock and boomerang like in the movie who is the main villain
movies,not_removed,is it worth seeing twice in theaters because i want to see it in imax if the film looked great
movies,not_removed,does it beat my beloved civil war
movies,not_removed,how was jai courtney
movies,not_removed,what was the tone of the movie like
movies,not_removed,does it still have that dark and gritty dc and doesnt turn into a schlock fest
movies,not_removed,really curious how jai courtney did
movies,not_removed,did you get a frozen coke
movies,not_removed,is there a point where joker loses any of the tattoos or anything like that honestly its the only thing bugging me about letos joker
movies,not_removed,the movie was great every single actor absolutley nailed their roles especially will smith and jared leto
movies,not_removed,i hate popcorn getting stuck in my teeth so no but i did get some for my friend hey ben
movies,not_removed,they didnt exactly give us tickets but they did give us a post screening survey we werent allowed any phones inside otherwise my snapchat story would be lit lol unfortunatley the survey doesnt have anything on it that shows what movie was played i can prove that the movie was shown using the theaters website however so i guess i cant prove that i attended but i can prove that it was shown on todays date at and you can trust me when i say that if theres a free movie as hyped as this one ill be there edit ive only seen fury to compare it to and i really like that movie too i think hes an outstanding director and he doesnt disapoint with suicide squad either
movies,not_removed,youre in prison yeah lets make a deal ok insert harley quinn reference boom boom powwwwww kishaaaa boom also the soundtrack is really really good fits every scene perfectly movie opens with sympathy for the devil
movies,not_removed,it was fiiirrreeeeeeeee
movies,not_removed,yeah when waller is meeting with the higher ups to get the squad together she explains that its sole purpose is to make up for the loss of superman in a world of monsters this is the only way to protect the country waller there is also a street vendor in dc thats selling remember shirts to honor superman
movies,not_removed,lol margot robbie getting dressed in her outfit on a more serious note there is a scene with her falling in the trailer that gets a little more elaborated in the movie as far as how she came about as harley quinn herself and i really liked that
movies,not_removed,yes do you want to know what it was
movies,not_removed,id honestly give it a im a big comic nerd and the movie nailed every aspect i was hoping for
movies,not_removed,pink unicorns man gotta keep em near
movies,not_removed,like the whole movie not sure what you want lol
movies,not_removed,there were definatley alot of parts that had the whole theater cracking up but i couldnt really tell that they were thrown in or anything like that the movie flowed smooth as milk
movies,not_removed,i did once i got back to my barraks
movies,not_removed,damn that song is fire i dont explicitly remember it being played but i might be wrong there is a scene with hq and joker riding in a purple lambo and it might have been playing there is a fire action bronson song playing when they showcase deadshot before he was sent to prison though
movies,not_removed,nah
movies,not_removed,the end
movies,not_removed,hes in there quite a bit plays a major role against the squad
movies,not_removed,leto absolutley killed his role it seemed like the animated joker inspired quite a bit of it as well im also a rediculously big fan of heath ledgers joker rip but its almost like the roles are two completley different things joker for this movie joker for that movie type of thing his laugh is killer too i really like him i do not think it was hot topicy at all will smith as deadshot was also amazing in the director talk he said that the whole movie was about family and coming together espicially diablo was surpirsed at how much i liked him too so when you watch deadshot up there hes kind of the hamarabe super glue to the whole squad he is what makes flags orders relatable to the rest of the gang dope af
movies,not_removed,im still riding the hype train right now and cant think of anything significant as of yet remindme hours edit there was one thing i noticed but it wasnt super significant spoilers there was a scene with diablo and a bomb where he has to push back an evil giant whos trying to fuckup the whole world and a bomb is waiting to be detonated under him time kind of slows down and everyone gets a little senimental especially becasue he just shared his whole life story and how he lost his family to his powers harley tears up i think lots of make up too hard to tell but hes the fire guy dont see how a bomb would affect him because of this maybe bombs arent the same kind of fire not too sure about that nothing major though
movies,not_removed,lol slipknot was there for such a short amount of time i forgot he was even there cant tell you if anyone else dies though its my one spoiler creed to not tell who dies boomerang was funny as hell and great in the action killer c was really reclusive in the start but came out of his shell skin later on main villain is enchantress and her brother spoilers
movies,not_removed,diablo dies and enchantress is the main villain
movies,not_removed,hell yeah it is im super excited to go see it a second time
movies,not_removed,much yes
movies,not_removed,intriguing then funny then serious then funny even more intriguing then seriously funny then so serious
movies,not_removed,he did really well added alot of comedic effect to certain parts he didnt have any backstory though and some of my friends said thats how it should be
movies,not_removed,captain boomerang is the only reason im seeing this movie i love the rogues so much man
movies,not_removed,i got a coke some mms a water and had a couple gummy worms from my friend so nope
movies,not_removed,dont know why youre being downvoted this is a great question
movies,not_removed,dark knight series first one was a little slow guardians of the galaxy xmen days of i really like xmen and i think they did a great job of fixing what went wrong in the third movie xmen apocalype age of ultron i feel like it was a little messy as a whole cival war winter soldier deadpool waited a long time to see that and it was the last thing i saw before i went to boot camp had a great time with my girlfriend trying not to be biased here but cant keep any promises batman v superman man of steel
movies,not_removed,joker is insane so im pretty sure getting ridiculous cringe worthy unnecessary tattoos wouldnt exactly be out of character for him
movies,not_removed,there is a scene where the enchantress shows quinn a fantasy where she and the joker are married neither of them have any crazy characteristics even the jokers hair and skin are normal and they are married with a couple children other than that no talking about who the joker is as a person is a really big topic for another time imo he would definatley sit through an ink session if thats what he wanted he also uses a couple of the tattoos in the movie has two on his hand that he uses at least twice by my count
movies,not_removed,its over
movies,not_removed,awesome i look forward to seeing it
movies,not_removed,sup
movies,not_removed,sure
movies,not_removed,what are some other comic book movie ratings youd give just for some context to how you rate movies
movies,not_removed,i want it bro
movies,not_removed,thats reassuring people are making it out like hes only in there minutes lol
movies,not_removed,can you safely say he has a solid minutes of screentime
movies,not_removed,i cant wait to showyoumytoys
movies,not_removed,no it did not
movies,not_removed,is her brother also hosted in someone else or he has his won body
movies,not_removed,thanks im gonna see it in the first time and the really enjoy it the second time in imax
movies,not_removed,yes thats how it should be he is not a supervillain just a petty burglar with boomrangs counts of burglary
movies,not_removed,ugh i hate to see civil war so relatively low but besides civil war and deadpool were riding the same wavelength cant wait for suicide squad myself that beautiful bohemian rhapsody trailer sold me so hard
movies,not_removed,i just cant imagine joker sitting still to get his ace of spades filled in let alone the goddamn grill on his teeth hed be too eager to grab the needle and start practicing on the tattoo guy
movies,not_removed,but you did really enjoy letos joker as a performance
movies,not_removed,ayyee
movies,not_removed,bruce wayne meets with waller for the exchange of some top secret files compensation for apprehending deadshot and quinn and the files contain the profiles for the flash aquaman and one other i wasnt able to recognize right off the bat hehe just a cameo for the justice league i guess
movies,not_removed,avengers guardians of the galaxy cival war batman v superman man of steel i honstley didnt like the styles of previous dc movies that much but i know that alot of people think that they were amazing they just dont pop as much as i think they should ss was great though
movies,not_removed,shit youre trying to give me arthritis forgive me for formatting and its not going to be in depth starts out in lousiana prison harley quinn shes being all sexy on some hung up sheets good music same from first trailer guard comes up and speaks to her she gets him aroused she gets shockd and has flashback to a few months ago where shes getting slightly tortured becasue of hospitalizing some others she then knocks herself out running into a metal bar next is deadshot same guard comes to give him a meal talking talking flashback to deadshot and his kid talking batman shows up deadshot has the drop on him but kid stops him arrested next is waller goes to talk to the right people about setting ss up denied next is enchatress and flag context goes back to waller with dc approved showcase the rest of ss doin their thing in the prison more good music ensues somewhere along the line they hop aboard the squad train and show flag what they can do skip around some and shit hits the fan with enchantress taking over the world shit theres alot more that i just simply cant put out ive written some movie scripts before for film classes ive taken and im not about to destroy my night writing this movie out either lol but thats pretty much the first minutes just introducing people and setting the theme of the movie great soundtrack good acting youre in for a treat
movies,not_removed,no no
movies,not_removed,at least
movies,not_removed,it starts off as a host but he has his heart so he grows to full power very fast
movies,not_removed,robbed all banks in australia before he came to america
movies,not_removed,civil war and ultron had some pretty bad pacing issues i judge movies on you gotta be kidding me moments and they both had quite a few if you thought civil war was a good for you people get too wound up on defending their view as the right view and i got that sentiment from your ugh comment
movies,not_removed,hes a bit of a wild card not bordeline retarded if he wants tattoos he will sit for them he is very smart which is partly why hes so scary
movies,not_removed,no he wouldnt while the joker is crazy hes always in control also this is gangster joker
movies,not_removed,i figured he and harley inked one another
movies,not_removed,somewhere in this thread i answered that in depth a bit short answer omg yes
movies,not_removed,alright margot robbie was a most excellent harley quinn but im a butt guy myself and her ass just wasnt doing it for me its nice and all but it doesnt have that certain jiggle im looking for
movies,not_removed,nice thanks
movies,not_removed,fyi theres ways to put these things in a spoiler block if you look to the left sidebar but since i already read it are the files the ones from bvs
movies,not_removed,batman v superman what
movies,not_removed,lol youre still gonna go i belive in the heart of the cards
movies,not_removed,and star city too
movies,not_removed,no need to be critical of what i said you noticed i said that i myself hate to see civil war scored relatively low to the other films he listed especially against tdkr and days of future past i really dont care what op thought of civil war itself but just gauged his ratings with my own based on him already viewing and liking suicide squad
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,its cgied too
movies,not_removed,yup those are the same ones
movies,not_removed,implying that that there isnt a huge contingent of people who loved the movie
movies,not_removed,im more surprised that civil war is the lowest ranked of all the movies he listed when it is probably the best or second best behind winter soldier marvel movie
movies,not_removed,well in that case cool beans dont know if thats a good thing or a bad thing
movies,not_removed,well the actress has no ass so they had to add some
movies,not_removed,they didnt cgi it lolthey cgied shorts on her cause it was a tv spotgo watch behind the scenes and see for your self
movies,not_removed,it wasnt a tv spot it was a character trailer and that scene was in trailer or i cant remember which but it was in one of those they didnt cgi shorts on her they cgied ass on her i did watch the behind the scenes you cant see anything because its a quick sideshot
movies,not_removed,you mean
movies,not_removed,ah shit youre right
movies,not_removed,i love how the channels he flips through all connect if you listen to them hilarious﻿
movies,not_removed,i live right next to a shop that has exactly the same layout i dont know if they did it on purpose﻿
movies,not_removed,its gotten to the point that theyre trying to spin the ghostbusters hate into positive press
movies,not_removed,sam mendes as an added bonus it would keep him away from the next bond movie
movies,not_removed,batman
movies,not_removed,ben affleck
movies,not_removed,tim burton michael keaton can play the joker
movies,not_removed,alfonso cuaron
movies,not_removed,id give it to shane carruth
movies,not_removed,none of my favorite directors would be likely to walk into this situation theyre all too anal about their scripts and controlling a project so that the final product is their own
movies,not_removed,paul verhoeven
movies,not_removed,darren aronofsky or david fincher would be cool
movies,not_removed,christopher nolan
movies,not_removed,kevin smith hes probably the most knowledgeable director when it comes to batman and hes worked with affleck on multiple occasions i doubt hell be approached for the job though
movies,not_removed,nobody we dont need another dark gritty mopey miserable batman movie especially after lego batman
movies,not_removed,i would love that the supporting cast in the bond movies reminds me of batmans crime fighting family as well as m being likened to alfred he also knows how to make a great villain he seemed to add a lot of depth and emotion to bond and i think he could do that same with batman a solid pick imo
movies,not_removed,in a rebooted dc cinematic universe this awful dceu doesnt deserve his efforts
movies,not_removed,hes also a terrible director who hasnt made a good movie in yeeeeeeaaaaaaaaars
movies,not_removed,his last few movies havent been great though like at all lets be honest i saw tusk and yoga hoosiers it was awful
movies,not_removed,but its still a car
movies,not_removed,the shallows is the first movie ive seen even mention uber
movies,not_removed,im a johnny uber just doesnt have the same ring to it
movies,not_removed,they order an uber
movies,not_removed,but really screw you for putting it in the collective consciousness im sure itll be in the new ghostbusters movie
movies,not_removed,über
movies,not_removed,i think that could be fun
movies,not_removed,yea a taxi looks like a taxi so calling it exactly that is good information an uber car is just a generic car its color or brand matters more and if uber is somehow part of the plot it can be explained to whoevers following the generic car afterwards during the chase
movies,not_removed,yeah also since ubers can be any type of car follow that uber does not give the driver any information it would be much more informative to say follow that car
movies,not_removed,and central intellgence roccks character orders an uber
movies,not_removed,i forgot the umlaut curse the reddit grammar police
movies,not_removed,thats why it needs to be lyft with the pink stache
movies,not_removed,spoilers jeez s
movies,not_removed,that movie is pretty funny shows the rock can act a little more diversly than tough guy grrrr
movies,not_removed,i just wanted to point out the origin of the word uber
movies,not_removed,supremacy probably its the same reason english is spoken to people who dont understand it in movies where the big bad british empire is here its to confuse them make them feel less they dont know such a higher and elegant language
movies,not_removed,i thought it was john wick meets rainman but the best description i heard for it was good will hunting meets bourne i really enjoyed it had a strong story with some cool action and great acting from affleck
movies,not_removed,i loved it i think anna kendricks face and afflecks humourous acting in the film made it great fun regardless of any hokey plot dynamics
movies,not_removed,it was slightly above average it couldve been a real good movie but there multiple instances of sloppy writing i think that accounts for the different ratings for critics v the audience it is a fun action film though
movies,not_removed,moonrise kids
movies,not_removed,i love adam diver but this looks like a feel good movie that might leave me feeling disappointed and empty
movies,not_removed,very excited its getting great reviews
movies,not_removed,nitpicky but thats a real cleaned up version of paterson missing all the herion and poverty in reality those two white anarchist kids on the bus would be passed out with a needle in the arm
movies,not_removed,ill put on the fact that its not actually the town of paterson its a place inside his head
movies,not_removed,i dont think this is going to be a particularly feel good movie more of a character study
movies,not_removed,tldr whoops
movies,not_removed,im glad they officially absolve beatty of the blame
movies,not_removed,all the early reports said he read the wrong name and it was faye dunaway who did never believe anything
movies,not_removed,i like the underworld movies but didnt know they had a new one coming out
movies,not_removed,kate beckinsale wakes me up inside
movies,not_removed,yeah just a week
movies,not_removed,hell yeah does it look good
movies,not_removed,most of the trailers focused on a select few scenes from the film that made it look bland but i saw another film that focused on different aspects and it seems much more interesting in that version i dont know which trailer it was but i think it was released recently
movies,not_removed,where were their other hands
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,good link
movies,not_removed,the long running time i actually appreciated this especially the extended version
movies,not_removed,like others have stated it was a pretty good movie but it was too long for most casual moviegoers to handle
movies,not_removed,the length to your casual or average movie goer was too much and became boring jack black was a strange casting at that time too he was really only known for comedy amongst the masses and then he shows up in this movie playing a serious part it just doesnt resonate with the audience that wants to shut the brain off for a couple hours
movies,not_removed,i dont know i loved it it took its time but that helped to develop things imo and naomi watts was great really sold the film imo
movies,not_removed,to paraphrase a better peter jackson film it feels thin sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread
movies,not_removed,its the same kind of movie that superman returns is a love letter from the film makers instead of a movie for the audiences theyre both good just unnecessary
movies,not_removed,the ice skating scene
movies,not_removed,it does not need to be as long as it is the original king kong told its story in minutes the hour run time feels indulgent and unnecessary peter jackson created fan fiction to explain things only a super fan of king kong would care about we did not need to know ann darrows backstory we did not need a love triangle between darrow driscoll and kong we certainly did not need an exciting action scene in new york
movies,not_removed,naomi watts screaming at the top of her fucking lungs every seconds
movies,not_removed,peter jacksons was our first warning that jackson may be stuck in epic mode he took a classic movie that was only minutes long and then bloated it out to three fucking hours filling it with several characters we didnt give a damn about and overblown cgi action sequences that were impossible to get invested in its only saved by the motion capture work of kong and his relationship with naomi watts
movies,not_removed,looks at all three
movies,not_removed,i didnt care for it for basically the same reason i dont like other peter jackson films a minute movie crammed into hours
movies,not_removed,too long it was filled with too much padding not enough story also jack black
movies,not_removed,i dunno i liked it i think it was cool to hate on jack black at the time
movies,not_removed,as many have said the lenght was the main issue por most people im always thankful that many theaters here in spain made an intermissionrest period of about minutes in the middle of the movie usually just after ann has ben caught by kong
movies,not_removed,i remember watching this in theaters when i was around years old the scene where theyre captured by the natives scared the shit out of me i had nightmares for days
movies,not_removed,i think it was mostly the length
movies,not_removed,it was like two hours too long the padding was simply obscene
movies,not_removed,i find it to be a very self indulgent film it didnt need to be an epic it needed to be a monster movie
movies,not_removed,what is this screenshot from
movies,not_removed,nobody wanted to see a hour king kong movie on christmas holiday
movies,not_removed,because it was long and boring as hell
movies,not_removed,too long some people also say quality of cgi being really inconsistent going from really good to painfully noticeable greenscreen
movies,not_removed,they couldve easily cut out most of the shit that happens on the ship before they get to the island
movies,not_removed,it got a poor audience rating because it was boring not only was it almost three hours it felt longer
movies,not_removed,too long
movies,not_removed,because they turned a story about a giant rampaging gorilla into a snoozefest
movies,not_removed,pretty simple the audience did not give a fuck about those characters theres nothing particularly compelling nor endearing about any of them so pretty much it was showing up for giant monkey mayhem and ended up getting way too much of it the film also only has one engrossing action sequence kong vs the trexes none of the rest of it was all that thrilling and personally as an exnew yorker i thought it was ridiculous that naomi watts just seemed a little chilled standing in a thin dress high on a building in the middle of winter
movies,not_removed,peter jackson is a hack he can do epic fking scene stuff but cant tell a story to save his life the lord of the rings had the same issue but had an epic story to pull from kong not so much
movies,not_removed,if you dont love green screen its a bit too much reminds me of the star wars prequels i also though the green screen was overdone there also naomi watts was terrible in that movie she just couldnt act by herself in front of the green screen it was like she didnt care about the movie
movies,not_removed,i personally couldnt stand jack black he was a sore thumb in that movie at least to me everyone else gave awesome performances and he just seemed off and goofy as usually
movies,not_removed,because its a piece of crap remake with too much bad cgi and weak characters thats truth downvote it if you wish
movies,not_removed,lol are you serious that movie was god awful
movies,not_removed,its very long and its one of those films like kingdom of the crystal skull that is far too dependent on cgi while what it showed us was imaginative the cgi really is just so overbearing that its difficult to take it seriously for what its worth though i did find it pretty cool and andy serkis killed it as usual with the mo cap
movies,not_removed,to be honest it really pissed me jackson made it in the first place lotr won oscars galore and did huge box office hollywood would have bankrolled him to make absolutely anything after that however instead of taking advantage to make something truly original and interesting he decided to do a remake not only that he decided to remake one of the absolute classics of early cinema a movie had already been remade once already he couldnt have picked a more pedestrian choice for a follow up if he had tried
movies,not_removed,there was no humour to it in trying to add some weight and gravitas they sucked the fun and life out of all the characters the supporting actors werent great either same issue in the hobbit the dwarfs are too forgettable black was supposed to bring a manic energy and charisma to the role but the audience never rooted for him they never wanted him to succeed
movies,not_removed,i liked it when i watched it at home and could take a few breaks but that was a pretty brutal movie to sit through in theaters
movies,not_removed,its not even casual or average movie goers look at this thread its too long without needing to be thats the issue you can make a movie that feels too short or you can make a hour movie that feels like hours king kong was the latter
movies,not_removed,im with ya call me a simpleton but i remember being entranced when i saw it in theaters
movies,not_removed,great post
movies,not_removed,i like that scene but would love auralnauts or somebody to add a big bass windowsqueaking noise as his huge butt slides across the ice
movies,not_removed,its always the film example i bring to the table when i want to talk about a director losing the ability to edit themselves after they score a previous hit and are thrown all the money by a studio for their next project jackson indulged every whim on king kong and it shows much to its detriment
movies,not_removed,hmmm i thought these were the things that distinguished the remake from the original and gave it a fresh and unique spin
movies,not_removed,you dont even see kong till gone an hour in there was too much to not care about
movies,not_removed,is there a fan cut anywhere that condenses the film i know people did that for jacksons the hobbit which improved it massively
movies,not_removed,i dont remember complaining about any naomi watts scene ever
movies,not_removed,also jack black but hes awesome
movies,not_removed,honestly this was my problem with it too watching at home is fine because i can have a break whenever i want but when i saw it in theaters for the first time it left a bad taste in my mouth probably from all the smelly popcorn urine i was trying to hold back
movies,not_removed,yup saw it in cinema when i was years old it seemed to drag on forever and that bugs scene with andy serkis getting eaten alive was fuckin brutal
movies,not_removed,the only issue with this movie is how fucking long theyre on that boat also jack black twas beauty killed the beast no jack it was the bullets
movies,not_removed,im very confused by this because im the exact opposite i sat through both independence day and in a double feature without even standing up inbetween thats hours straight yet i cant watch independence day in one sitting at home
movies,not_removed,yeah especially with a cup full of drink
movies,not_removed,and he did it again with the hobbit i miss braindeadera pj
movies,not_removed,when you need a punching bag
movies,not_removed,ive seen a lot of movies but nothing really makes me sick like that god damn canyon scene i skip through it every time i watch the movie all the bugs are disgusting in that film
movies,not_removed,that line is from the original
movies,not_removed,actually the problems with the hobbit came about from very different circumstances peter jackson only took over the project at the last minute and didnt have anything prepared for it yet the studio wanted to push ahead with the current filming schedule this meant that pj was literally filming stuff he prepared the previous day when you compare how he looked before the start of principle photography to the end of production you can see how the stress of production had taken massive toll on him
movies,not_removed,theres a music group that makes music prices to accompany horror movie scenes they have one called cretaceous chasm you should watch it the group is blotted science
movies,not_removed,which one if you mean the first line its in both the original and remake
movies,not_removed,and the official game of the movie
movies,not_removed,if only the fact that peter took over the helm late on when it comes to the hobbit was well known i feel he would have much less hate for them he never wanted to do the hobbit films and as you correctly said he was shooting stuff next day one telling part of the saga that is the hobbit shoot was when peter called a wrap before the filming of the epic fight that would be in the battle of the five armies because he didnt know what he was trying to show or convey they revisited that sequences months later if not a year
movies,not_removed,it was a phenomenal movie such a fascinating film because it has all the same beats of an action disaster movie but being rooted in real life makes it so much more impactful and berg did a brilliant job building the sense of tension and dread throughout the first and second act his approach made the oil into almost a monster in the film the final act felt almost like the end of alien so cool and yet so moving and powerful in the resolution
movies,not_removed,i work on an offshore rig and i was shocked how well they nailed some of the little things
movies,not_removed,i am mildly interested in catching it i used to work about blocks away from one of their offices in houston and they had a large statue out front honoring the victims of the dh disaster that office has since closed due to the tanking of the oil industry and the statue is long gone they probably melted it down and made some bronze back scratchers for the executives
movies,not_removed,what the hell was malkovich doing with his voice the entire movie is that based on a real person
movies,not_removed,i also think its weird that theres no official discussion thread wow what a ride i think you probably summed up why im very hesitant to see this movie right there deepwater horizon was the biggest oil spill in the history of the oil industry i feel weird thinking about it like its a ride as far as not sounding an alarm heres the the movie is based on if youre mad that no alarm was sounded youve got to be mad at real life people
movies,not_removed,is it really meant for imax what kind of scenes are
movies,not_removed,yea exactly what backdraft is like the fire is another character in the movie it has personality and is pretty evil
movies,not_removed,thats exactly what i was thinking during the movie they call it a monster in the beginning the way the shots are set up showing the mud creeping through the cracks or strange sounds coming from the walls really make it seem like the oil is a beast coming to get them
movies,not_removed,nice id be interested to know which aspects in particular you are referring to if you dont mind describing just got back from a screening and as someone with no expertise on the subject at all one thing i was curious about while watching is how accurate the films depictions of real oil drilling operations were
movies,not_removed,as long as bp is put in a bad light im fine with it
movies,not_removed,it can be a ride but so long as it is honest to people the history and the event then i have no issue i recently watched manhatten season the least respectful least honest and worst ending of any piece of media quite literally ever its the angriest ive been now up until the final point it was some slocky dramahuman interest time filler mind numbing but that ending spoiler alert america drops nuclear bombs on japan this is morally grey some argue the protection of the american soldiers from what be a tought battle akin to the invasion of america justifies the end others argue that it was more a show of force towards russia who had in large gained a mythological appearence while denying them greater influence in the asiapacific region allowing america to obtain a surrender now you might be person or person theres a bunch of stuff to read and certainly an argument either way but somehow this show just glosses over the moral gray area with a morally white one in which the argument is show them being detonated to japan on some unihabited island cause maximum damage because these weapons are only getting more powerful and the biggest warning to save more lives is to use them it was the biggest cop out ive seen they had a chance to make a good ending something to think about but instead they do this fuck the worst thing is that you could actually make a really interesting relatively cheap tv show about the manhatten project and maintain the historical accuracy and the philosophical questions raised instead you force lesbian mischief and romance drama that just repeats itself
movies,not_removed,well it wasnt disrespectful or anything it seems to have portrayed the actions of the men and and women as accurately as hollywood usually does with these types of movies look at sully world trade center united and even lone survivor they are thrillersaction movies that pay respect to the heroes and fallen of the events they even used sound bytes from the real guy mark plays at the testimony of bp bp even supposedly funded the film and it puts the entire blame on them
movies,not_removed,my thoughts exactly when i saw the trailer and started to realize what it was about i couldnt really believe it it was a horrible catastrophe to be incredibly cliché too soon man too soon
movies,not_removed,the entire last act when the whole oil rig explodes and they have to try and snuff the fire out and evacuate the rig
movies,not_removed,what does bp stand for i always see it mention in regards to the movie
movies,not_removed,the lone survivor comparison is exactly the thing that bothers me it seems like its just a tough guys in danger being heroes type picture that doesnt dwell at all on the political or environmental impact of the story i got a real squeamish feeling when i saw the lone survivor trailer and they talked about the warrior spirit
movies,not_removed,the film goes to a great length to pay homage to those killed it tells a powerful story with purpose not exploitative at all
movies,not_removed,i dont hate the idea of a movie about the catastrophe its just not a film thats going to cover the aspects of it that im interested in its gonna be a tough guys in danger movie
movies,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikibp specifically httpsenwikipediaorgwikibpdeepwaterhorizonexplosionandoilspill
movies,not_removed,british petroleum they owned the rig and their negligence is why the spill happened
movies,not_removed,have you seen lone survivor it was fucking great
movies,not_removed,the movie tries to show you a lot of the procedures they were doing before the accident some of which i didnt even understand the film puts the blame entirely on bp its actually kind of like the history channel show i think it was seconds to disaster just with no voice over telling you whats going on but then again i have no idea if the procedures they were doing were accurate or not but it seems to me like they might have risked alienating the audience to try and be accurate
movies,not_removed,no it doesnt bp officially changed its name to bp when it merged with amoco in the us media constantly called it british petroleum in the news to try and distance america from the disaster i expect the movie to be no different
movies,not_removed,no he wouldnt he doesnt care about the people just the politics not interested in the tough guys in danger
movies,not_removed,just saw it they were never called british petroleum
movies,not_removed,good to know i cant say anything about the movie since i havent seen it yet so its just called bp now
movies,not_removed,tldw no its not a rip off inspired by sure but not a rip off most of the points levied in this video are just basic story arcs and thematic elements haha found in most adventure stories for example both have protagonists who in their personal lives arent that responsible slightly scummy guys that really dont want to be protagonists well thats like ever anti hero character ever also as stated in the video any visual similarities can be attributed to the production design artist being the same for both film and book jean moebius giraud which is one of the reasons jodorowsky and giraud thats right moebius sued them after working on the film and it had released lost their cases
movies,not_removed,french connection unforgiven and the royal tenenbaums in that order
movies,not_removed,the conversation
movies,not_removed,hoosiers
movies,not_removed,i loved him in crimson tide he fit that role to a tee he has a lot of film credits that i dont know but i just love him in that movie as a fan of westerns and clint eastwood i hated his role in unforgiven its a good movie well its almost a great movie i just dont understand the worship with that movie though and i just cant suspend belief when i see gene hackman in a western role he has such a modern persona that i get taken out of the movie when hes in that western role
movies,not_removed,popeye doyle i love crimson tide but the best performance ive seen him put in was in the french connection
movies,not_removed,crimson tide
movies,not_removed,the blind man in young frankenstein
movies,not_removed,young frankenstein
movies,not_removed,the quick and the dead brought some real gravitas to an otherwise fun popcorny movie
movies,not_removed,you can almost list his whole filmography he has an odd prescene on screen he was always gene hackman in everything he played but he really personified the characters he played until heath ledger hackmans lex luther was the best characterization of a movie villain filmed his best role was the gene hackman action role he played that character in the french connection the package target uncommon valor night moves he was also spectacular in the royal tenenbaums crimson tide unforgiven class action mississippi burning no way out hoosiers superman i and ii night moves the poseidon adventure
movies,not_removed,the blind man in young frankenstein
movies,not_removed,the conversation and the blind hermit in young frankenstein
movies,not_removed,royal
movies,not_removed,the french connection
movies,not_removed,personally i like him in enemy of the state hes a phenomenal actor with dozens of classic films under his belt that just happens to be my favourite film of his
movies,not_removed,everyone on here nails the roles he was one the first actors i saw where relatability really came through in nearly all of his roles he would shrug or glance a certain way and it would make him seem like a family member or friend suddenly it was if i knew this guy and had to be sympathetic to him
movies,not_removed,hoosiers
movies,not_removed,south park with christopher reeves
movies,not_removed,willy wonka
movies,not_removed,popeye doyle is one of my favorite characters from the
movies,not_removed,thatspretty astute
movies,not_removed,ditto
movies,not_removed,as a fan of westerns and clint eastwood i hated his role in unforgiven i thought that was one of his best roles little bill is not all that far off from will theyre both bad men theyre both trying to carve out a life in a world that has no place for bad men bills got his leaking house wills got his sick hogs hackmans little bill isnt any less evil that eastwoods will hes just been a bit more successful
movies,not_removed,wrong gene
movies,not_removed,nice try nice try
movies,not_removed,i didnt think the role was bad i just didnt like hackman in that role i couldnt take him seriously in that setting
movies,not_removed,o
movies,not_removed,i also agree that it was a pretty bad movie the visual effects were good but thats about it
movies,not_removed,its what i would call a badgood movie i watched the first independence day last weekend and as far as im concerned its the same a badgood movie visually very good but story wise and acting wise both both average and over the top bordering on hammy cough jeff goldbloom cough on the flip side i consider a movie like battleship a goodbad movie overall not a great movie but there is something in it that makes it watchable every time my wife and myself put it on its one of our go to switch the brain off movies usually in a double bill with battle los angeles
movies,not_removed,it was pretty bad
movies,not_removed,the effects were great i loved the lore but the entire movie plot was broadcast so eairly nothing suprised you the acting from the early who were the best of the best fighter pilots make me lol i liked the entire lack of military discipline and non fighter pilot talk they all had no proper terms names or codewords nothing im not suprised will smith turned down the movie
movies,not_removed,resurgence is just a good popcorn flick there are much worse films out there
movies,not_removed,are you a hackers o
movies,not_removed,if resurgence was released or years ago people would consider it to be a great film
movies,not_removed,dead right it doesnt do anything very new story wise over the original but visually looks great an enjoyable if forgettable movie in a movie and tv era of really great intelligent and clever scifi the image of the mothership astride the earth looks amazing if a little too unrealistic which says a lot given the movie
movies,not_removed,tarantino
movies,not_removed,kathryn bigelow can make a movie just as intense and heartstopping as ben affleck can shes got my vote and i think their styles sync up well
movies,not_removed,probably gavin oconnor
movies,not_removed,if they have a shit scriptwhich was a case times with dc then it wont matter who is directing but gerath edwards seems like a fine choice i dont think that he has anything planned right now and he has experience working on a big movie villaneuve wouldnt like his hands tied by dc sam mandes also seems like a great nottoo obvious choiceroad to perdition is a great film i would like to see someone like george miller directing batman but he wouldnt have the freedom had on mad max
movies,not_removed,zack snyder
movies,not_removed,maybe david fincher im not a huge fane of his or anything but i could see it maybe
movies,not_removed,just not snyder he had one film which he did a good job with one he did a passable job and the rest have been bad yet the studios still give him work

movies,not_removed,lol that was it they slapped a on just for quirky situations jesus
movies,not_removed,only a tiny bit accurate pg for quirky situations action and language
movies,not_removed,wait what that was pg still quirky though
movies,not_removed,my god thats a rating description that i would expect to see from something like the saudi arabian censor board
movies,not_removed,its
movies,not_removed,i imagine that a movie like pink flamingos would break the minds of the people at the mpaa
movies,not_removed,aka it makes me uncomfortable but i dont know why
movies,not_removed,gotta love the mpaa for all of their quirkyness
movies,not_removed,loved it when tom and jerry used to team up together
movies,not_removed,the place beyond the pines was about moving on from a terrible one to a better one the light between the oceans has to be about the love between two very different people cianfrance is a good filmmaker but his films are a bit painful to watch
movies,not_removed,im not surprised i thought it was pretty suspect that they held the embargo for so long on a film like this its kinda funny how many reviews are comparing it to a lifetime flick
movies,not_removed,as much as ive been looking forward to this the trailers were a disappointment and so i am not shocked to see this isnt a smashhit it looks way oversentimental
movies,not_removed,huh this is genuinely surprising cianfrance has a good track record as well as fassbender and vikander also its only been reviews
movies,not_removed,cianfrance is all style and no substance so it doesnt surprise me that the light between oceans is being trashed as being as mawkish as its soapy title wouldve suggested lousy book as well
movies,not_removed,ive read this book so was keen to see the adaptationseems like it was marketed as a romantic drama i suppose to capitalise off the real life romance but its very much not that type of story odd marketing campaign
movies,not_removed,tides turn light between oceans nice
movies,not_removed,my problem with blue valentine is how it wallows in such misery and giving typical romance tropes in such a phony gritty stylization no one ever bothers to look into the why anything happens in that movie it reminds me of people in high school writing cryptic facebook statuses begging for everyone to give them attention the place beyond the pines is an improvement but while cianfrance touches on why anything happens in this movie hes rushing through his development while simultaneously providing an uninteresting and meandering second act
movies,not_removed,youd probably like the lyrical content of httpsyoutubeyolaospchy then

movies,not_removed,kiramidhead and shadowpred discuss the first attempt at a serious batman film from the early httpwwwstitchercompodcastscreenplayarchaeologyrefidstpr httpswwwfacebookcomscreenplayarchaeology httpscreenplayarchaeologytumblrcom
movies,not_removed,agreed i really enjoy bekamambetovs flair for putting the audience in the action he showed it in wanted and in night watch
movies,not_removed,ill take your word for it
movies,not_removed,need more paragraph breaks
movies,not_removed,went to this last week when i was traveling to kill some time this is the only scene that didnt bore me i completely agree with you
movies,not_removed,i really like that director its a movie i will check out when it comes out on blu ray
movies,not_removed,youve convinced me i love a good action scene and nowadays they seem hard to come by so ill give the movie a look
movies,not_removed,i thought most of the different parts of benhur were good like directing acting and the sets but it all didnt come together that well
movies,not_removed,was the movie bad or was it just not advertised properly i had no idea until yesterday there was a new benhur movie i never saw a single commercial ad or trailer for it did someone screw up or was there so little hype because it was really bad
movies,not_removed,thanks for sharing your thoughts with such detail and intelligence i can genuinely say it was a pleasure to read you had me sold by the end of your paragraph especially with the comparisons to master and commander lotr and fury road im not familiar with the previous versions and didnt intend to watch this one due to the backlash but i will definitely try to watch it now when it hits dvdstreaming hopefully my expectations wont be so high that i spoil my first impressions how beneficial do you think it was to see this in the cinema eg with regards to sound immersion pacing etc
movies,not_removed,when i saw the cgi water in the trailer i was fucking done
movies,not_removed,benhur movie is better than any sea battle in the pirates of the caribbean movies and though similar to rise of an empire oh well thats high praise how does it compare to master and commander
movies,not_removed,ill stick with master and commander
movies,not_removed,aww dang it i only saw benhur from when the final race started
movies,not_removed,its funny you mention that i was sent an email about free screening tickets to see benhur a few weeks ago i really had no interest in seeing it but checked out the trailer for it just out of curiosity when watching that trailer i saw that massive sea battle and thought it looked good then noticed the theater showing the screening is one of the nicer ones in the area with awesome imax screens that won me over and decided to go to the screening unfortunately i get there a half hour early and the line is already outside the building i was probably ten people away from the ticket booth and they cut it off saying the theater was full legitimately bummed me out but it is cool to know that scene was actually as great as it looked in the trailer
movies,not_removed,as someone who has not seen the original ben hur i quit enjoyed watching it well worth
movies,not_removed,better than the end battle of the admiral roaring currents surely not
movies,not_removed,still not enough to get me to watch it if it pops up on hboi might watch the opening credits
movies,not_removed,what about the fight on top of the submarine in the original batman movie
movies,not_removed,did we watch the same movie
movies,not_removed,it seems op is trying to defend a poorly reviewed remake that everyone wants to tank at the box office and almost no one has seen thats a bold strategy cotton lets see if it pays off for him
movies,not_removed,do you think you could say sea battle a few more times 😉
movies,not_removed,i didnt see it and probably wont ever see it
movies,not_removed,also abraham lincoln vampire hunter bad movie but the action scenes were really well choreographed and intimate
movies,not_removed,im a casual fan of bekamambetov ever since night watch i havent sought out his work to watch but i get excited when i see his name attached to projects if it hadnt been until well after all the reviews were in that i found out he directed nu ben hur i might have made plans to see it i still will probably but its down the list
movies,not_removed,okay thnks
movies,not_removed,done
movies,not_removed,i agree that this already amazing scene could have been made even better if they had james cosmo test ben hur like in the version he was on screen too briefly but i appreciated that they made his role different enough
movies,not_removed,when you do come back and tell me if i was right or not
movies,not_removed,i would go as far as to say that half the changes worked quite well in the half but half the changes didnt work so well in the the movie had a two tone feeling which can be frustrating especially because this adaptation had a lot going for it but due to its overt commitment to being fast paced with a shorter run time than the version and its overall lack of necessary exposition it becomes a mixed bag its not fair to actually say this is bad movie but nor is it a particularly good one either its both and that will turn off some people but if you can bear its mistakes you will also love its improvements this is still the type of movie you should see on the big screen i caught it at a matinee price grade of c
movies,not_removed,the films main differentiation from the version is in some ways its greatest strength and greatest weakness unlike the sombering expository dialogue scenes in the version that allowed the full weight of its emotion to blossom or drag the movie down a bit if you are of that opinion this movie is intentionally fast paced with major scenes happening in rapid sequence sometimes too fast for its own good this film would have been greatly improved if more dialogue scenes and exposition were added specifically in the second half the first half runs along quite fast but it works quite well so that we never get bogged down in one particular place or setting it managed to be fast paced enough to get through the material quickly but slow enough so as to make sure what is occurring is meaningful unfortunately the opposite is true of the second half especially in the controversial final act of the movie the had lots of really good emotive scenes that made you care for the lives of the characters but here those scenes are entirely absent so that when we should care about the fate of everyone it becomes almost meaningless and its because of this the film fails to be a really good b movie whereas the first half of the movie alone is a solid b for its riveting action and compelling drama the second half is lowered to a c or d grade for its portrayal of the crucifixion of jesus which i think the movie totally botched and ben hurs resolution with his family a lot of people mimic what i say when they were on board for the first half of the movie but that the second half lost them already knowing to expect something bad the blow was softened so it didnt hurt as much but i still felt its rushed anticlimactic ending despite this a particular component of the final act i surprisingly found touching and was genuinely moved though i would understand if others find it absurd you can think of it like the infamous martha scene in bvs generally speaking all of the actors and acting in this movie are really good save morgan freemans character who some would accuse of phoning it in but i felt he and his wig never detracted much from the movie the two tone feeling of this movie can be frustrating especially because this adaptation had a lot going for it but due to its overt commitment to being fast paced with a shorter run time than the version and its overall lack of necessary exposition it becomes a mixed bag its not fair to actually say this is bad movie but nor is it a particularly good one either its both and that will turn off some people but if you can bear its mistakes you will also love its improvements this is still the type of movie you should see on the big screen i caught it at a matinee price grade of c
movies,not_removed,well the visual impact is obviously much better on the big screen but you should read my over all review in it over at truefilm
movies,not_removed,to be perfectly honest its way better than it looks no way does the trailer do it justice
movies,not_removed,exactly that star trek movie has the best sea battles ever
movies,not_removed,its different enough to be distinguished on its own its not the same at all but in terms of intensity and simply good filmmaking there is nothing else to compare it to
movies,not_removed,this is a different type of naval warfare its ancient and its different enough to be judged on its own merits this isnt a naval movie like mac but it does happen to have one hell of a naval battle in it
movies,not_removed,why and how
movies,not_removed,fyi always know that anytime a movie is giving out free screenings you literally have to show up hours in advance to get in
movies,not_removed,you saw the new movie if so you really should see the version though as i mentioned the sea battle in this one is lightyears better than the version the versions chariot race is absolutely better than in this one
movies,not_removed,well see
movies,not_removed,you the one from
movies,not_removed,i think you watched this one
movies,not_removed,or its actually possible that a flawed movie like this can contain an gem in it which i certainly think it does the scene lasts maybe minutes tops the new movie absolutely has its problems and the critics were right about a lot of them but in their criticism they didnt really address what the movie got right and actually improved upon from the original including but not limited to massala who is made into a compelling character here unlike the one in the version in
movies,not_removed,sea battle
movies,not_removed,have you actually seen the movie
movies,not_removed,holy fuck thats awesome
movies,not_removed,honestly i dont think the movie was bad i dont see how it could have been better considering the topic
movies,not_removed,no problem
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i just walked into the theater because i arrived over half an hour early to kubo and the two strings and in a fortuitous encounter i saw that the race was just about to start
movies,not_removed,yes definitely planning on buying the classic version on bluray
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,just to be clear im not making fun of you more acknowledging the insurmountable task of trying to defend a movie in any way that everyone here hates without seeing you do have me very curious to see this scene
movies,not_removed,he said a few more times
movies,not_removed,look blu ray it it you must though i would at least suggest catching it at a matinee because a lot of its action is great on the big screen
movies,not_removed,i know no movie theaters thatd allow that i can only imagine its possible if the guy checking the ticket doesnt give a shit at all
movies,not_removed,well i found the benhur a chore to sit through so i doubt ill enjoy this remake if i can catch the scene by itself i will but i really dont have any interest in the whole film
movies,not_removed,the films main differentiation from the version is in some ways its greatest strength and greatest weakness unlike the sombering expository dialogue scenes in the version that allowed the full weight of its emotion to blossom or drag the movie down a bit if you are of that opinion this movie is intentionally fast paced with major scenes happening in rapid sequence sometimes too fast for its own good this film would have been greatly improved if more dialogue scenes and exposition were added specifically in the second half the first half runs along quite fast but it works quite well so that we never get bogged down in one particular place or setting it managed to be fast paced enough to get through the material quickly but slow enough so as to make sure what is occurring is meaningful unfortunately the opposite is true of the second half especially in the controversial final act of the movie

movies,not_removed,the horror films coming out of south korea tend to have some comedic elements usually waning as the plot ramps up over time you can see that in both the wailing and the host both of which are great movies as far as foreign horrorcomedy in a more pointed sense there is a thai anthology called that is really good most of the segments are more plainly horror but one of the segments that revolves around a group of campers is completely hilarious troll hunter is another really fantastic and fun found footage movie out of norway with a lot of sharp humor and amazing creature effects
movies,not_removed,awesome thank you
movies,not_removed,is actually on my watch list for tonight
movies,not_removed,awesome hope you enjoy it

movies,not_removed,i hate to be a detail oriented jerk here but the animated bfg was not a disney film the new live action bfg is disneys first swing at adapting the novel
movies,not_removed,easy money i honestly am more than happy with it as long as it is more like cinderella and jungle book unlike alice in wonderland disney has bankable products that ensure it always makes huge money every year which are star wars marvel disney animationpixar disney live action remakes of animated content
movies,not_removed,to keep us in a perpetual state of nostalgia while the world falls apart around us
movies,not_removed,i like disney movies i like liveaction movies and i like disney liveaction movies so i dont see a problem
movies,not_removed,we need to talk to someone about getting liveaction versions of treasure planet and atlantis
movies,not_removed,one word money also the animated versions came out when todays parents were kids these parents are now growing up and having kids with the nostalgia theyll take their kids to see the newer version of their childhood favorites
movies,not_removed,as long as they are more like the jungle book and cinderella and less like maleficent or alice in wonderland then i have no problem with the remakes
movies,not_removed,if theyre gonna keep doing this then id like to see them remake the hunchback of notre dane with charles dance as frollo
movies,not_removed,because they can
movies,not_removed,because disney wants money
movies,not_removed,easy money
movies,not_removed,money
movies,not_removed,why not they would have done this before but the technic was not good enough
movies,not_removed,and in petes dragon was also live action with only the dragon was animated the same with this remake this seems like an uneducated film critic making up a crap story
movies,not_removed,i think itd be cool for them to shine a light on some of their underappreciated films those two and the black cauldron would be awesome to see in live action
movies,not_removed,who do we get for quasimodo looks like a tom cruise job to me

movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i knew literally nothing about these two guys have never watched formula one in my life and this movie is easily my favourite in this category
movies,not_removed,i forgot all about rush loved that movie
movies,not_removed,i wish i had the words to describe how utterly fantastic that film is
movies,not_removed,the cool thing about this movie is that its about true not full of made up characters and situations like most true stories
movies,not_removed,i really like that movie because its so smooth to watch i watched it during the flight over the great ocean once for three times in a row
movies,not_removed,one of my favorite movies in general i can rewatch it many times and not get bored of it
movies,not_removed,david finchers most perfect film in my opinion not my favorite but technically i think it is his best
movies,not_removed,do people ever call me names you mean like retard yeah no i loved jake in that movie my favorite role of his him and downey jr were pretty good together
movies,not_removed,so well done absolutely love the tone from start to finish
movies,not_removed,i remember reading people that had been in organized crime say watching goodfellas is like watching home movies
movies,not_removed,thread
movies,not_removed,this movie is great jack black is underrated
movies,not_removed,loved narcos so ready for the new season
movies,not_removed,i loved leos performance but hate scorseses directing in this movie too much like blow and goodfellas hes done great movies i dont know why he likes to be so formulaic with his biopics
movies,not_removed,ooh good one especially as the movie itself plays with the idea of how much of it is real or not
movies,not_removed,i love that film i watched it so many times and it never fails to amaze me the whole story should be too bizarre to be true
movies,not_removed,british beatlemania
movies,not_removed,thank you
movies,not_removed,im sure youre being sarcastic but for those who dont know fargo is not based on a true story and the coens admitted making it up to make the story more believable
movies,not_removed,on a serious note everyone should check out kumiko the treasure hunter its actually based on a true story about a japanese woman who believed fargo was truly based on a true story to the point she goes on a mission to try and find the hidden money
movies,not_removed,lol braveheart is very historically inaccurate
movies,not_removed,based on a poem loosely based on a true story
movies,not_removed,the social network was a great movie havent seen zodiac yet
movies,not_removed,well your not wrong per say
movies,not_removed,this is still a true story
movies,not_removed,so ludicrous it had to be true loved that movie
movies,not_removed,heil shitler
movies,not_removed,hey man you have an opinion take a downvote
movies,not_removed,even better if you watch them chronologically consider it a trilogy
movies,not_removed,i totally remember that happening like it was just yesterday pray for la
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,jesus thats a true story
movies,not_removed,that ending was heartbreaking
movies,not_removed,post modernism in a nut shell
movies,not_removed,watch if you havent already
movies,not_removed,mind blown
movies,not_removed,the score really helps that film amble along
movies,not_removed,i respectfully disagree i would say that the social network is his best work so far
movies,not_removed,godfather or godfather part ii hold that title
movies,not_removed,i felt really underwhelmed by that film maybe i just set my bar too high because black and linklater though i will say black knocked it out of the park in the film maybe i should revisit it and i may enjoy it more
movies,not_removed,who by
movies,not_removed,ole miss john glenn
movies,not_removed,same with both seasons its before every episode and makes me smile every time i see it
movies,not_removed,well to be fairthe question in the post has the phrase based on a true story in quotesso a sarcasticjoke answer might be interpreted as the best also i think its better to go into to the movie not knowing that
movies,not_removed,thats only an urban legend you know the woman kumiko was based on committed suicide
movies,not_removed,thats what that movie is about lol as someone who has only ever seen and the poster for that film i thought the premise would be moremagical or animeish
movies,not_removed,its a great film but its as much based on a true story as the original fargo is if i remember its based on a tabloid rumour that started after a japanese business woman was found dead in minnesota
movies,not_removed,good indie movie
movies,not_removed,hence the based on
movies,not_removed,yep fits the context of the question
movies,not_removed,ive already updated my facebook pic
movies,not_removed,lol
movies,not_removed,no im not crying again
movies,not_removed,i watched it immediately after my second viewing of rush was very impressed with how accurate the portrayal of lauda was compared to archival footage
movies,not_removed,the social network is my favorite movie of his but theres just something that puts zodiac over the top for me i thought he did the period setting very well his direction was marvelous the idea to use a different zodiac every murder because of the different descriptions was a perfect idea shot composition and lighting was all the best hes done its all the little things for me the only thing that id say the social network does better is the script
movies,not_removed,i watched the entire epic cut of and in one sitting with my fiancee what a fucking masterpiece it was a blizzard so we had nothing else to do and it tells a story that is massively wideranging
movies,not_removed,youre right the journey is true the reason is urban legend been a while since ive seen the movie and researched the real story
movies,not_removed,exactly
movies,not_removed,are you thinking of the godfather
movies,not_removed,huh didnt know it came in parts i hadnt watched it until a few years ago and streamed it online
movies,not_removed,yeah the epic cut which may have been the one you saw its cut chronologically and without flashbacks is the directors cuts of and with the bits moved around for the chronological telling of the story almost hours or so but worth the watch at least once
movies,not_removed,i have only seen the theatrical version its been awhile since ive watched it so i may be mistaken where does part pickup in the story sorry just trying to piece this together
movies,not_removed,part one is the brando one with a young michael coreleone originally left out of the family biz vito gets shot sonny takes charge and then dies mikey makes his move killing solazzo and mccluskey goes tomitaly gets married wife gets detonated he comes home takes over from vito ends with him smacking up fredo then ordering the hit on the five families to consolidate power crazy good ending hence the second the second splits time between vitos escape from sicily rise in new york and the boss he offs and then michael trying to make the big move with roth through havan in thats when he finds out about fredo and johnny ola kisses him good bye and the ending the third one never happened
movies,not_removed,okay so he was talking about the godfather thought this was about goodfellas and was completely confused
movies,not_removed,no worries
movies,not_removed,so perfectly creepy yet playful if only they had chosen to make the movie animated this would have been the perfect art direction
movies,not_removed,i love this guys art been following his website for a while now
movies,not_removed,im interested to see the movie but some of the changes from the book really confuse me for example why they would switch emma and olives namescharacters when there doesnt really seem to be a reason for it
movies,not_removed,ive been watching penny dreadful recently just made it through all of season and im super excited for this movie now iva green is fantastic
movies,not_removed,is this movie basically like xmen same idea
movies,not_removed,im psyched for this finally made my way through the novel and i enjoyed it hoping its a return to form for burton its the kind of thing that is basically perfect for him
movies,not_removed,wonderful fan creation
movies,not_removed,best part is they double as ads for burtons last film big eyes
movies,not_removed,wait is this an animated movie
movies,not_removed,or stop motion like corpse bride nightmare before christmas
movies,not_removed,looking at the trailer it looks like they have completely switched their rolesrelationships in the movie as wellweird decision will probably have to wait until they start doing press for the movie to find out
movies,not_removed,it looks like floating girl becomes the love interest for jacob so they made her emma instead of olive well see how it turns out
movies,not_removed,yeahmight wanna not continue on to season it has a strong start but at about the halfway point it becomes painfully obvious thatb they werent renewed the quality of everything drops like crazy
movies,not_removed,im halfway through the second book and its like xmem meets percy jackson its ok just feels very obvious it reminds me of percy jackson by the ham fisted way the author weaves in historical fiction like riordian did with ancient greek stuff i think this will actually make a better movie than a book nectar the author isnt very good
movies,not_removed,looks like if tim burton got to direct xmen
movies,not_removed,xmen wasnt twee enough and i say that as someone looking forward to seeing this
movies,not_removed,my boyfriend said this seems like a mix between a series of unfortunate events and xmen
movies,not_removed,dieselpunk burtonian xmen
movies,not_removed,hipster xmen
movies,not_removed,yeah thats what it looks like but my question is why would they change that theres literally no reason to
movies,not_removed,thats really disappointing the show itself is kind of odd i enjoyed it but only to an extent the majority of the episodes were far too wordy for me with not enough actual action going on and way to many subplots that never seemed to go anywhere we get it john claire youre ugly i think the concept of the show and iva greens performance kept me going thats sad to hear that took a downhill turn but at least we get a bit more of my boy lyle
movies,not_removed,thats what im thinking cant help but see so many similarities
movies,not_removed,im guessing tim burton liked the idea of a floating girl better i hope she at least retains emmas personality even if not her power
movies,not_removed,not to rain on your parade but it doesnt seem so surprising its only got around votes on imdb there are plenty of movies that i wish would have a blu ray release too
movies,not_removed,its a little odd youd think a boutique label would have done it by now
movies,not_removed,what parade

movies,not_removed,mother lovin john carpenters the thing starring kurt russell and diabeetus guy holy crap it was suspenseful as hell also the original alien by ridley scott was pretty damn suspenseful too
movies,not_removed,the silence of the lambs fun fact gene wilder was originally supposed to play hannibal lecter but two days before shooting began he demanded that the rest of the cast be fired and he play all the roles himself of course the producers denied this request and wilder walked sir anthony hopkins was available on short notice and the rest is movie history meanwhile gene decided that his vision needed to be fulfilled so he mounted a one man production of a stage show version however after a two night preview in lansing michigan he was slapped with a cease and desist from the movie studio and had to close shop those who saw the production say that his goodbye horses dance was better than the one in the film but the rest of the production was in the words of one critic a goddamn fucking mistake
movies,not_removed,sorcerer one of the most suspenseful and tense movies ive ever seen especially the bridge scene

movies,not_removed,there was some controversy when this movie came out because the movie is basically homicidal asian killers chasing down an innocent white family owen wilson and lake bell some people thought it was racist or whatever but who cares its a movie and not a documentary its soooo good very underrated

movies,not_removed,the town
movies,not_removed,the kingdom especially the ambushabduction scene

movies,not_removed,if you dont want to watch stretch which is an action explosion from carnahan you should watch running scared with one of paul walkers finest roles this is also a thrill ride even if i never reffered to the former as a thrill ride

movies,not_removed,its older but frantic with harrison ford
movies,not_removed,argo
movies,not_removed,the bourne legacy although ill never know if its edgeofyourseat effect was due to the movie itself or to the fact that the movie theater i watched it at sold chocolate covered coffee beans and i consumed an entire bag over the course of my experience it also didnt help that i happened to go see it while i was in manila and the audience was going absolutely wild towards the end of the movie during the motorcycle chase through manila
movies,not_removed,green room and the invitation
movies,not_removed,tarantinos death proof dont think ive ever been as nervous as during that movie

movies,not_removed,the black swan
movies,not_removed,gravity grab that fucking space station me
movies,not_removed,the wages of fear
movies,not_removed,duel joyride and open water fit the bill as well
movies,not_removed,the whole movie wasnt like that but for an example of an edge of your seat scene done absolutely perfectly check out the russian roulette scene in the deer hunter unbearably intense
movies,not_removed,hours
movies,not_removed,i feel like most movies dont carry that intensity all the way through but they have some great scenes or periods of intensity so id rather go by scene dreamcatcher sitting on the toilet trying to get the toothpick not a great movie overall but that moment unbelievably intense mad max fury road in the theater that first part of the chase when the spiked vehicles attack the rig once they were staved off i remember physically relaxing on second viewing it wasnt as intense but initially it was like minutes of holy shit tons of horror movies have these moments but i think its pretty much impossible to sustain a high level of intensity you become numb to it after awhile you have to have those moments where you relax then build up the tension again
movies,not_removed,i thought the invitation was a very tense movie all the way through
movies,not_removed,aliens that movie doesnt give you much of a break once it gets going especially that ending
movies,not_removed,high tensionfrench i saw the devilkorean martyrsfrench inside french end of watch youre next fury the holy mountain i know theres way more but i cant think of them right now
movies,not_removed,gravity kinda had that effect on mei saw it in maybe thats why
movies,not_removed,cloverfield lane was a rollercoaster
movies,not_removed,arlington road
movies,not_removed,the vanishing
movies,not_removed,toy story
movies,not_removed,green room as well
movies,not_removed,sicario as well
movies,not_removed,prisoners definitely i thought only scenes could be super tense didnt know you could make an entire movie with that feeling and overall brilliant performances from everyone especially jackman gyllenhaal and dano
movies,not_removed,collateral is so underrated tom cruise should play the bad guy more often seen the rest of these as well
movies,not_removed,i love prisoners
movies,not_removed,the man from nowhere is fuckin awesome one of the best action movies of the last ten years for sure
movies,not_removed,one of my top movies great choice
movies,not_removed,i feel the major action sequence is that way but overall the movie has plenty of more relaxed moments excellent movie
movies,not_removed,this movie had me going too loved it
movies,not_removed,look at me looked at me i am the captain now
movies,not_removed,seen them all some of my favourite movies too
movies,not_removed,fincher and gyllenhaal need to team up again zodiac is one of my all time favorites
movies,not_removed,that not many people have basements in california scene
movies,not_removed,my favorite fincher film and one of my favorite films of all time
movies,not_removed,ill add gone girl to that
movies,not_removed,seen them all didnt like ex machina thanks though
movies,not_removed,is blue ruin as good as green room or does it become too slow at times
movies,not_removed,was going to say this movie is intense af and very fast paced
movies,not_removed,glad to see this mentioned here its mostly forgotten and a great ride of a film
movies,not_removed,havent seen this can you tell me what its about try to keep it spoiler free
movies,not_removed,the motel scene when the sheriff is investigating is the most intense nail biting thing ive watched
movies,not_removed,add to that in the mouth of madness also a john carpenter film
movies,not_removed,to this day i dont think ive seen a movie that gives me the feel of sheer dread like the thing did
movies,not_removed,gene wilder was originally supposed to play hannibal lecter is this true
movies,not_removed,no way out
movies,not_removed,my friend showed me that after just going more or less i saw this really cool movie check it out i was not prepared for those two and a half hours of depressing grimness
movies,not_removed,wolverine goes full on charles bronson
movies,not_removed,it should be totally fine watching it at home when you have the wall behind the tv instead of just a dark theater the frame of reference really helps with it
movies,not_removed,one of the most intense movies ever the camera work really helps to create a claustrophobic atmosphere i dont think ill ever watch it again but im glad i saw it
movies,not_removed,i dont really like horror movies but ive heard good things about the witch what kind of movie is it if its mostly jumpscares ill skip it
movies,not_removed,the call is really good and i rarely hear people talk about it
movies,not_removed,lol so true
movies,not_removed,i really liked the movie but wouldnt say its the edge of your seat type of movie
movies,not_removed,in many scenes it was exiting but it also had a lot of really slow scenes where something important happened but it happened in a slow motion kind of way
movies,not_removed,the entire ciudad juarez scene is the most intense moment of film i have ever seen i was shaking
movies,not_removed,easily jackmans best performance ive ever seen
movies,not_removed,its not underrated in any sense of the word
movies,not_removed,just watch prisoners its basically fincher
movies,not_removed,and rdj
movies,not_removed,agree they are meant for each other
movies,not_removed,zodiac is so underrated
movies,not_removed,can i ask why you didnt like ex machina out of curiosity id love to hear another perspective on the film
movies,not_removed,blue ruin is the better movie green room is the more fun experience
movies,not_removed,it stars kurt russell he plays this yuppie guy whose on a road trip with his wife their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere and a truck driver stops to help his wife agrees to go with the trucker to get gas but they never return its up to kurt russell to figure out what happened to his wife its an awesome thriller that often gets overlooked
movies,not_removed,hes right though its a great movie and is indeed very tense and edge of your seat
movies,not_removed,how is that film its been on and off my list for a year now
movies,not_removed,if it is ill eat a train piece by piece after derailing it with my penis
movies,not_removed,the foot chase in that is amazing right no shaky cameras just locked down cameras that only pan across allowing the action to be seen properly couple that with an amazing score excellent stuff
movies,not_removed,i have a projector the entire wall us my screen it was still awesome though
movies,not_removed,it is the opposite of mostly jump scares
movies,not_removed,this is going to get me some downvotes but i think prisoners is overrated its a fine movie but too much of it is just watching people make bad decisions the whodunnit was super obvious and when the film finally throws in something interesting into the investigation it just ends up being a red herring
movies,not_removed,seen it and love it but its not fincher i still love villeneuve though and im super excited for all his upcoming projects
movies,not_removed,but better
movies,not_removed,dont know why you were downvoted for that but i totally agree
movies,not_removed,zodiac i dont know maybe because i saw it on a plane the audio was garbage i had a headache and i stopped midway through it i know its not fair but i never gave it another chance probably should though
movies,not_removed,i honestly just disagreed with the protagonist the villain was killing off his own ai i dont see anything wrong with that so the movie fell flat for me
movies,not_removed,i kinda lowed the pace of green room too bad its not the same thing but i will still watch it though
movies,not_removed,fucking movie scared me as a kid
movies,not_removed,i loved this movie and think its one of the best horrormystery movies give it a try
movies,not_removed,ok youve convinced me ill probably watch it tonight
movies,not_removed,prisoners was a decent script made as perfectly as it couldve been
movies,not_removed,i didnt downvote you but i gotta say i was tempted prisoners is a tour de force but its not really fair to downvote you for merely expressing your opinion without being an asshole about it plus if we agree on everything here it would get boring pretty quickly
movies,not_removed,eh i prefer zodiac
movies,not_removed,definitely a slowmoving atmospheric movie hope you enjoy it
movies,not_removed,zodiac is great but in my opinion villeneuve is a better director
movies,not_removed,villeneuve has been good so far but he still has a lot to prove before even being comparable to fincher in my opinion
movies,not_removed,why the fuck do i see this trailer reposted every single fricken day
movies,not_removed,this movie looks absolutely retarded cheesy but it has a bear with a gatling gun so im probably gonna watch it for the laughs﻿
movies,not_removed,werewolf
movies,not_removed,this looks like stupid fun
movies,not_removed,rated wonder how it works in russia
movies,not_removed,the dub seems pretty bad
movies,not_removed,bearwolf
movies,not_removed,age restrictions are absolutely random in russia and nobody gives a shit about it kids are free to watch rrated movies almost everywhere during deadpool shows cinema theatres were full of them
movies,not_removed,when i saw it i couldnt believe how mediocre it was i dont care that the cast is female what annoyed me is that it all seemed like its going be one of those movies where the comedy is forced and you wont be watching the movie being invested in the characters legitimately when i saw the trailer it reminded me of the scooby doo movie if youve seen it youll know how utterly average it is when people see a remake being made of a movie that is so good originally they want the remake to at least be decent that trailer makes me not even want to watch the new one it could be good but more likely it will be just another unnecessary remake of a crowd favourite
movies,not_removed,this whole thing is a huge mess people cannot decide whether its a sexism racism or whatever agenda at the end of the day its one of the most beloved franchises and it does not get treated with the respect it deserves the trailer wasnt particularly good but neither was it awful somewhere in the middle slightly leaning towards uninspired as to why its getting hated so much its just unlucky coincidences or mistakes people hate stereotypical characters yet we have of them in this trailer people didnt want a remake yet we get one people dont like feminist propaganda yet this trailer and movie allegedly seems like it the internet can be cruel marketing they had to do some research but it seems like they absolutely did not how this comes as a surprise for the studio and executives is beyond me if they had done any kind of marketing analysis
movies,not_removed,dislikes on the old trailer and times more dislikes than likes on the new trailerboth trailers are ugly and stupid
movies,not_removed,a paranormal researcher melissa mccarthy a physicist kristen wiig a nuclear engineer kate mckinnon and a subway worker leslie jones one of these things is not like the other they could have at least made the racism not so overt the only minority character is the only one without a masters degree
movies,not_removed,the jokes were awful the acting was awful the characters were a stereotype fair and the cgi was mediocre the music was pretty rad tho
movies,not_removed,as a woman who is overweight i loathe melissa mccarthy and every joke she makes in the movie is that she the comedic relief at the expense of her weight and the fact she has a vagina i havent seen the original ghost busters so i have no loyalty to the franchise but from the trailer it felt to me like a bunch of frat guys wanted to make a movie about empowering women and totally fucked it up even the male character they introduced seems beyond simplistic and trying to emphasize the feminity of the team while the writers i can only assume think that by including eye candy theyll get better sales
movies,not_removed,not funny at all
movies,not_removed,we all wanted ghostbusters not parodybusters the remake part of the new gb cinematic universe that ignores the originals
movies,not_removed,its not funny and it looks like nothing more than a genderswapped remake of the original
movies,not_removed,people are followers they jump on the bandwagon of hate without even knowing why in this particular case its a lot of feminist hate and a lot of people upset about ruining the original peoples lives have become too easy
movies,not_removed,i absolutely hated basically every joke im a mellissa mccarthy fan loved a bunch of her movies and dont even really care about the original ghostbusters too much but this trailer just made me cringe
movies,not_removed,im with you on this one i dont get the hatred it looks like a perfectly standard comedy to me with its usual stereotypes cliches and jokes i loved the original just as much as anyone else and i fail to see how this remake is hurting or disrespecting it the original will and always will be nothing can change it as for the genderswapping all i can say is why the hell not
movies,not_removed,its not the same ghost busters imagine the new joker was a woman i have no doubt shed kick some ass and maybe her acting may be miles beyond that of ledgers not possible but get the point its not the same character youve completely changed a movie ive grown to love id be equally upset if cat woman became cat man so dont go with the whole only because its a woman and jesus their jokes are horrible its like somebody bought the franchise and is purposely destroying it out of some childhood vengeance and i enjoyed brides maids and some other movie with that fat chick so dont start hating on me about chick flicks tank girl was one of my favorites growing up
movies,not_removed,people are butthurt for many reasons mostly not to do with the movie itself even if they say otherwise the fact is none of us have actually seen the movie sure the first trailer wasnt the best but the looked better and i do think paul feig and the cast are talented im cautiously optimistic about the movie but open to it if it turns out good edit you all downvoted me and the person who only barely said the movie looks okay you just proved how butthurt you are
movies,not_removed,its miles ahead of the first one still not very promising i dont really think it deserves to be drowned in downvotes but thats the internet for you
movies,not_removed,yeah i feel like its more about hot button topics no matter if its folks baiting or others taking the bait the racism aspect mentioned the black character doesnt have a degree as well as the feminist part some feminists are upset that it falls short of their message and others are upset due to fat jokes then if you are like me and just sick of cash grab remakes there is that to be upset at it really is one big mess
movies,not_removed,i hate it because its a reboot they shit all over the ghostbusters franchise for what some sjw movie pass want to make an all female ghostbusters sequel ie ghostbusters fantastic im in make it a reboot and throw away the original movies fuck you im not watching it edit downvotes with no counter argument i see cowardly sjw safespacers are out in force today
movies,not_removed,httpwwwslashfilmcomlesliejonesghostbusters
movies,not_removed,did i miss something in the trailer that they made a fat joke about her did you watch spy
movies,not_removed,i thought her role in the heat was spectacularly empowering spy starts with cringeworthy but gets some redemption in
movies,not_removed,and i enjoyed brides maids and some other movie with that fat chick so dont start hating on me about chick flicks youre undercutting your own defense with statements like this
movies,not_removed,people are butthurt for many reasons mostly not to do with the movie itself its gonna be funny to see this you only hated the trailer because youre racist spin backfire hilariously its especially funny because the movie itself is racist with that ridiculous unfunny caricature black woman
movies,not_removed,funny that this comment is drowned in downvotes for saying so
movies,not_removed,what you just said is exactly what your accusing others of fucking idiot if your upset at someone for not seeing the parallel your not seeing the parallel
movies,not_removed,hmm i think this role would make more sense for the black woman
movies,not_removed,i didnt watch spy no i tend to avoid most things with melissa mccarthy because i hate the body of work that i have seen of her
movies,not_removed,the heat you mean where she was a grimy sob with a dysfunctional family that she more or less said fuck off to i understand im the queen of unpopular opinions but i dont agree further i feel like her mainstream career started with mike and molly which was really just a comedy about two fat people admittedly i havent seen the spy edit why all the downvotes did i say something that was incorrect
movies,not_removed,the main complaint about the negativity is pointed towards sexism which is totally different than racism and again no one has seen the actual movie to know that her character is just a caricature now im not saying people are racist sexist im simply saying people have many different reasons for hating this movie but most of them have nothing to do with the quality of the movie itself especially since no one has seen it
movies,not_removed,is drowned
movies,not_removed,spy is actually pretty funny and shows her potential i recommend watching it
movies,not_removed,people arent judging the whole movie people are judging the shitty ass trailer and often times shitty trailers lead to shitty movies ghostbusters is a lot more than a simple movie for a lot of people thus people are heavily invested into it and are now being presented with a lukewarm reboot can you please provide sources that the dislike is about sexism up voted or popular articles screaming sexism
movies,not_removed,sorry im not familiar the handbook of reddit downvote measurement terminology
movies,not_removed,yea im upset they ruined the movie i know the outcome your still the idiot though
movies,not_removed,i wouldnt go that far but i have to agree that it is dumb how he chose to change this
movies,not_removed,i have seen tons and tons of people judging the whole movie and not just the trailers and its a known fact that paul fieg movies have had shitty trailers but his movies turn out good ill admit that spy looked cliché and terrible but it was marketed all wrong and it was actually great now i cant say for this movie because ive not seen it ghostbusters is a big part of my childhood as well but what you said is exactly what im talking about hating this movie before it has come out based on the fact that its ruining my childhood is not a great excuse but its one that many have leaned on im just willing to give it a chance i never said the dislike of the movie is directly related to sexism nor do i fully believe that i simply stated that that is the biggest criticism towards the people with a negative reaction to the movie thus far you can find articles and reddit posts that are a dime a dozen on the topic the downvotes on my post here and anyone else who says something moderately nice about the movie should prove that people are absolutely butthurt about this movie regardless of the quality of the actual movie people dont even want it to be good they want to hate it they want it to fail it could be better than the original it wont and all of these people will hate on it as long as its still around im not saying its going to be amazing or even that im personally really excited for it im just a ghostbusters fan who likes the cast and is willing to keep an open mind
movies,not_removed,your still the idiot though the joke writes itself
movies,not_removed,yep illinois nazis suck
movies,not_removed,as if rockin dance numbers with some of the best wasnt enough it has one of the best car chases ever
movies,not_removed,i remember i watched this movie all the time as a kid and dont remember this at all have to add it to my list to watch again
movies,not_removed,and theyre on a mission from god
movies,not_removed,hes wallowing around somewhere hoping he one day achieves brendan fraser status on rmovies
movies,not_removed,no danny boyle
movies,not_removed,i dont have time or want to bitch on who may be missing but i just want to say that im pretty is not a picture of andrea arnold
movies,not_removed,no woody allen
movies,not_removed,what the fuck is going on in this thread just a bunch of bots upvoting each other
movies,not_removed,justin lin somehow managed to create what feels like a continuation of jj abrams cinematics from star trek and star trek into darkness albeit with a lot less lens flare for a film celebrating the anniversary of the star trek franchise lin deconstructed the narrative essence behind star trek and through beyond took us back to the principals the show was built upon like equality togetherness and general utopian idealism the film even pays homage to the episodic format of the relative tv show through the landing kirk on a planet to contend with the local hostile aliens motif there are some continuity errors in the film and a few gaps in the logic but these are forgiven as the movie offers audiences a fun adventure that brings the franchise back to its beginnings
movies,not_removed,paramount getting desperate
movies,not_removed,holy shit im so glad youre here to say that
movies,not_removed,once there are enough upvotes and the obvious spambots are nixed it wouldnt surprise me to see this as a sponsored thread rhailcorporate
movies,not_removed,i feel like there could be an awesome perspective from the pov of the nimh scientists youre working on an intelligence boosting serum testing it on some rats and mice tests are going well but one day you arrive at work to find evidence of an elaborate escape and the animals are gone you investigate a nearby farm where the farmer is telling about his tons of electrical supplies have been going missing and how the rat infestation in his rosebush is bad they wont fall for traps so you go there plow the bush and holy crap you find architecture engineering siphoning of electricity all evidence of a hyper intelligent rat civilisation that knew you were coming cue my god what have we done
movies,not_removed,im with you to a point but now what about jeremy he would not have had any chance to have been experimented on when nicodemus is speaking of the experiments he says that they learned to read english and understand complex problems such as how to escape this would point to the idea that these creatures had a level of intelligence before but only after were they able to solve out how to siphon energy and build impressive architecture i believe that mr ages is trying to come up with basic remedies for the diseases that ail his friends perhaps trying to find a way to lengthen nicodemus life so that the move to thorn valley can be made the way nicodemus speaks though i believe that he wants to lead his people to become a separate civilization he talks about how stealing from the farmer is disgraceful thank you for reminding me of a show of my childhood i have not been to visit mrs bris and the rats of nimh for a long time and it is good to think about them again
movies,not_removed,i know i will get hated on for saying this but don bluth is criminally under rated everyone always talks ghibli ghibli ghibili but bluth done some of the best most lush detailed scenes yet i never hear anyone mention his name online
movies,not_removed,the secret of nimh animal farm
movies,not_removed,i wonder if this is addressed in the book at all will read and report back
movies,not_removed,this movieand the dark crystal were my absolute favorite movies as a kid after watching them as an adult i kind of look back with a but of pride on the subject
movies,not_removed,so what you are saying is nimh is a prequel to pokemon
movies,not_removed,is that a movie about nickel metal hydrate batteries
movies,not_removed,in the nov new york times science section a story has been published titled speech gene shows its bossy nature where a single gene known as has been found to be responsible for speech or lack thereof all animals have an gene but the human versions product differs at just of its units from that of chimpanzees suggesting that this tiny evolutionary fix may hold the key to why people can speak and chimps cannot it was noted that the mutation does several things that aid in speech including modifying jaw structure and tongue length
movies,not_removed,i suspect youre reading too much into it mr ages is basically the local apothecary all most animals can communicate with each other in this universe regardless of their nimh background
movies,not_removed,i love everything you guys are talking about but unfortunately its just too close to the existing planet of the apes franchise
movies,not_removed,i like this line of thought it makes the movie seem like it has many additional layers of story that while arent addressed specifically are alluded to in ways like this
movies,not_removed,im obsessed with this story i want to make free roam game centered around it like the witcher but with mice
movies,not_removed,if you havent read the book read it i was introduced to the book first and while i now know a lot of people grew up loving it when i first watched it i was almost dumbfounded at how they butchered the source material
movies,not_removed,you wont believe number
movies,not_removed,johnathan wasnt that smarthe was killed by the farmers cat dragon
movies,not_removed,luckily its just a few rats its not like the intelligence can spread to the local wild life right
movies,not_removed,i for one welcome our new rat overlords
movies,not_removed,scp archive here we come
movies,not_removed,if the rats and mice of nimh have this serum running through them i have a feeling that with the initial ones that escaped that if eaten it might effect the host that would explain the great owl since owls eat rats and mice so to me its possible thats how the great owl came to have even more intelligence then a owl would normally have rats and mice are pretty low on the food chain so if you ask me i think thats more plausible then aegis making more of the formula or at least trying to i just dont see any upside the rats and mice are already smart and their offspring are also smart so unless the goal is to convert more animals it just doesnt make much sense
movies,not_removed,he just wants the sparkly
movies,not_removed,sam wise
movies,not_removed,not sure where youre going online but the secret of nimh is an internetreddit favorite and don bluths name is everywhere nostalgia critic even has a whole series about him
movies,not_removed,holy shit i just looked him up i never realized how much of my childhood he shaped
movies,not_removed,totally agree about don bluth i had to do an essay about any animator from any era for my animation class i picked bluth after realizing he was responsible for a good chunk of movies i grew up watching that werent from disney and surpisingly not a lot of people in my class besides the teacher knew who he was his art style was so distinct
movies,not_removed,there are no dumb animals in the book they can all talk to each other naturally without any scientific enhancements the owl is smart just bc hes an old owl nihm has only made some of the rats and mice and their offspring smarter the smarter animals can escape cages read invent and use technology farm and ultimately create civilization they read books mostly to learn how to farm recreate civilization
movies,not_removed,same here good taste right out of the gate fuck yeah having said that i tried my hand at rewatching heman recently since its on netflix holy shit its a dumpster fire
movies,not_removed,nimhnational institute of mental health the movie is about them carrying out experiments one of which results in their rodent test subjects gaining remarkable intelligence and escaping their lab
movies,not_removed,how is your genetic reject doin edit you your
movies,not_removed,i thought the same thing i was super excited but now im disappointed
movies,not_removed,which would be fine if not for the fact that he is very obviously reading nimh research papers while conducting his experiments
movies,not_removed,some similarities but nothing too crazy definitely a far different likely more dangerous threat which eliminates the need for some sort of apocalypse virus
movies,not_removed,some would say the movie is better than the book
movies,not_removed,well yeah but did he fuck up or was it a setup because he found out the true intentions of the plan you know make it look like an accident is a certain characters primary operating procedure
movies,not_removed,the rat gestation cycle is only days long a rat reaches sexual maturity at weeks so have enough smart rats breeding with smart rats and you could have a massive infestation of intelligent rats in just a few months
movies,not_removed,she does say something about jonathan teaching her to read a little but the children being much better at it you could say thats just because kids are better at learning new things but i think the implication is the children have inherited at least some of his enhanced intelligence
movies,not_removed,or maybe they need regular infusions of the substance to maintain their intelligence so he needs a regular supply as their bodies metabolize and therefore consume the initial doses
movies,not_removed,yes frodo
movies,not_removed,the secret of nimh timmy to the rescue ugh why do things have to exist
movies,not_removed,mrs frisby also notes that her children picked up reading etc faster than she did presumably because they are the offspring of mr frisby who had the serum
movies,not_removed,the owl is smart just bc hes an old owl which is a persistent mischaracterization of the animal owls are dumb as rocks even for birds they have tiny brains to make room in the skull for huge eyes they dont have eyeballs they have eyecylinders like binoculars which gives them superior hunting vision not much room for grey matter though they also cant turn them to look at things like an animal with a normal eyeball does so they have very flexible and agile necks
movies,not_removed,thanks i googled the movie now guess i am not that funny after all
movies,not_removed,sorry dammit i just couldnt help it
movies,not_removed,i took the downvotes for science
movies,not_removed,well youve got the alzheimers cure being tested on animals then the animals escaping i love the concept that the owl after predating some of the modified rodents became incredibly intelligent
movies,not_removed,the only real objection ive heard is that movie introduces magic into the equation which was completely absent from the book
movies,not_removed,well thats the thing you dont see any girl rats among the original population my personal theory is that johnathan meets the wild mrs brisby and falls in love yet cant bring himself to having an actual relationship due to the huge differences in their mental faculties which is what spurs him to try and bring intelligence to others animals in the first place as the only two mice that escaped were him and aegis no girls survived with the help of aegis they begin their research with only nichodemus himself aware of their endeavors with most of the other rats of the opinion that they should let the lower creatures fend for themselves and expressing no interest in love so to speak johnathan launches into this endeavor with love and good intentions as his sole motivation but nichodemus and aegis realize the full potential and actually have darker motives they want to move to thorn valley not only to hide from the humans but also to have a solid base of operations in order to raise a civilizationand an army
movies,not_removed,in re willard
movies,not_removed,the experiment scene does specifically show dna manipulation but it could also be that jonathan used a more advanced version of the serum on the children as well
movies,not_removed,i dont think the brain works like that once they become self aware like they are i dont think its something that can be shut off im thinking it works like the new planet of the apes he gave them the alzheimers drug and they became smarter but they didnt need to keep getting it also even if they did have more or were exposed to more it didnt make them more intelligent then again im some guy on the internet who hasnt seen the movie in like years so i could be wrong maybe theres other clues that would prove your right my thoughts are that they wouldnt want to do what humans did to them thats why i dont think they would make more
movies,not_removed,middle earth really went down the drain after everyone went on their cruises
movies,not_removed,i think it was voted the worst sequel of all time
movies,not_removed,frisby
movies,not_removed,its an absolutely incredible movie if you havent seen it like holy shit level of good
movies,not_removed,i was obeying your username i failed the first time
movies,not_removed,not really magic so much as super high level technology it shows that the rats have actually become smarter than the humans the stone is basically a philosophers stone
movies,not_removed,write a screenplay find an animator
movies,not_removed,i have felt some fannon things about johnathan pressuring mr aegis to recreate the serum but mostly to extend his wifes lifespan any other benefit he might use as a starter rationalizing recreating it but his primary reason being trying to in a way save his wife nicodemus even tells her johnathan didnt tell her because he would massively out live her i imagine that was a sort of personal conflict with him i think its strongly implied john had no intention of following the rats anymore but still cared for them
movies,not_removed,you should read mrs frisby and the rats of nimh the book the movie was based on most of the book is one of the rats telling mrs frisby about the rats escaping and then their life and society out in the wild
movies,not_removed,the books show that the genetic changes are inheritable the sequel book racso and the rats of nimh features rasco a rat whos father was expelled from the colony rasco is highly intelligent though illiterate at the start of the book he makes his way towards the farm following rumors from local wildlife about the rats who live there and on the way meets timothy one of the children of mrs frisby timothy is headed to thorn valley to attend the rats school and rasco joins him mrs frisby is still alive but quite old by this point since shes ageing at a normal mouse speed but her children and rasco all have the same slowed aging that all the rats have
movies,not_removed,not a bad theory at all i was thinking about how in limitless he had to keep a therapeutic dose of the chemical to keep his superior intelligence
movies,not_removed,ya but it sure got less crowded
movies,not_removed,the movie changed the name to brisby due to confusion with a popular flying disk
movies,not_removed,the main mouse familywhat was their name
movies,not_removed,its also a cartoon that features blood and the word damn
movies,not_removed,nah but the pugs great had diarrhea these past few days but is okay now
movies,not_removed,ehhh what happens at the end is more akin to the force than anything scientific
movies,not_removed,anyone got don bluths number p
movies,not_removed,thats not a bad angle to think about ether but i think theres a difference between heightened intelligence like limitless and a more self aware social skills wearing clothing kind of awaking like the rats mice had i think of it like tumor once you grow a tumor your stuck with a tumor until you do some treatment to shrink it and cut it out if changes were made to dna to change your brain to be smarter and process speech your skeletal structure to walk upright once those changes are made they wont roll back so easily i gotta watch marvels luke cage tonight but once i get time ill rewatch the movie to make sure im not talking out my ass
movies,not_removed,for good reasons i hope
movies,not_removed,huh neat
movies,not_removed,heh if youve never seen it check out watership down
movies,not_removed,its a philosophers stone designed to enhance telepathic potential jonathan made it after conducting the experiments that gave nicodemus his telekinesis
movies,not_removed,don bluths he is working on dragons lair but if you have a screenplay ready when hes done im sure youll get at least a phone call and read
movies,not_removed,man are you me because luke cage and nimh are my list right now
movies,not_removed,i first saw watership down when i was and my mother chose it for a post girl scout cookie sale movie and pizza party for my brownie troop i loved it the other girlsnot so much d i tried to get my husband to watch it and he pretty much it i dont do that when we watch movies hes nostalgic about and his are far more objectively terrible i might have to start
movies,not_removed,interestingnever wrote a screen play before but i guess theres a first time for everything
movies,not_removed,the first episode was epic lots of references that help place it in the marvel universe unlike weve seen done previously even a reference to a name we havent heard since iron man its fucking awesome
movies,not_removed,im learning production and editing just takes practice and commitment and people enjoy making time for what matters to them
movies,not_removed,do it
movies,not_removed,american psycho its definitely not a comedy but eventhough the trailers of the movie would suggest otherwise theres some really funny parts in it
movies,not_removed,django unchained coming into that movie thinking it would be some classic action western then here comes austin powers jamie foxx and a kkk jonah hill to me its got great comedy with great drama
movies,not_removed,the martian
movies,not_removed,i really enjoyed stranger than fiction that or the truman show id say
movies,not_removed,in bruges is funnier than of movies billed as comedies
movies,not_removed,grand budapest hotel in bruge kiss kiss bang bang the big short
movies,not_removed,housebound
movies,not_removed,true grit was alot funnier than i thought itd be i was expecting a sort of darker no country for old men which also has a lot of dry comedy but is mostly existentially and atmospherically oppressive but instead i got a bit of fargo in the old west lots of humorous exchanges of dialogue although very emotional most of it was relatively light hearted and comedic
movies,not_removed,its about a divorce but it is fn hilarious also jeff daniels is incredibly good in it i got big respect for him as an actor after thisand i already thought he was pretty good
movies,not_removed,brick for those of you who dont know brick the first film by rian johnson of soontobe star wars ep viii fame is a neonoir set in high school the entire movie is filled with hilariously transplanted noir hallmarks at one point the hero shouts at the vice principal if you have a disciplinary issue with me write me up or suspend me and ill see you at the parent conference in the same way a detective might shout if ive broken a law arrest me and ill see in you in court the drug kingpin lives in his mothers basement its great but the movie plays all of those moments completely straight the teenagers led by jgl dance their way through noir lingo with ease theres never a pause for laughter the movie is scored by sad introspective music and there are moments of real heartbreak and a mystery at the core thats actually complex and compelling its almost a satire definitely a pastiche with a quiet chuckle throughout but to someone who wasnt too familiar with the tropes of noir or who isnt paying close attention you could take the entire film at face value as a serious movie
movies,not_removed,last action hero you wouldnt believe how many people dont get that its a parody of action films

movies,not_removed,american beauty a movie that won best picture had references to reanimator and some amazing humor like the smoking pot in the garage scene and honey this is ricky fitts
movies,not_removed,dr stangelove it plays everything so straight and even some of the actors thought they were doing a drama
movies,not_removed,starship troopers without a doubt i remember thinking it was so terrible at the cinema it wasnt until a few rewatches that i appreciated its satirization of fascism zegema beach
movies,not_removed,the room
movies,not_removed,bvs
movies,not_removed,the hangover if that doesnt count stranger than fiction
movies,not_removed,nightcrawler
movies,not_removed,it is most definitely a dark satire
movies,not_removed,i cant see fuckin shit outta this thing
movies,not_removed,i always laugh at the part right after they pull broomhilda from the hot box samuel l jacksons character says something to django along the lines of you gonna come inside or you gonna sleep in that box out there followed by a quick zoom in on djangos face the way its cut from the intensity of broomhilda in the box to that is an unexpected comedic break
movies,not_removed,yes loved the martian even more because of the unexpected comedy
movies,not_removed,how is the martian funny
movies,not_removed,stranger than fiction is among my favorite movies ever but i feel like it was supposed to be a comedy or at least a dramedy
movies,not_removed,the first time i watched the truman show i didnt know what it was and my vhs copy made it out to be a hilarious jim carrey comedy i was pretty surprised
movies,not_removed,how is that movie not billed as a comedy
movies,not_removed,i saw grand budapest reluctantly and ended up loving it
movies,not_removed,thank you housebound is such a great movie and it adds tons of humor to horror without cheapening either love love love housebound
movies,not_removed,ya think so doctor
movies,not_removed,rimgoingtohellforthis but the racist banter was so funny in that movie
movies,not_removed,ive been putting this one off for a long time you dug it convince me and ill finally get around to checking it out
movies,not_removed,dont recall this being at all funny
movies,not_removed,the coens are the masters of dark comedy
movies,not_removed,the blues brothers was an snl movie it never tried to be a serious movie
movies,not_removed,wut
movies,not_removed,best thing about the book as well
movies,not_removed,i guess you probably havent seen the movie or read the book well despite the life and death stakes the main character is quite relatable and has a great sense of humor that works really well
movies,not_removed,im pretty sure the book is marketed as a comedy
movies,not_removed,it was billed as an actioncrime movie from an acclaimed dramatic playwright i know i was surprised when first seeing it at least
movies,not_removed,ditto very funny and not what i expected
movies,not_removed,the nazi car falling for seconds only for the other one to fall in the crater and the bluemobile going right over gets me every time there are so many amazing moments and quotes definitely in my top comedies
movies,not_removed,fair call
movies,not_removed,your mother
movies,not_removed,i did see the movie thats why i asked and since you mentioned the life or death stakes one of my biggest problems with the movie is that i never felt the threat of danger i was never truly worried for the protagonist he solved every problem as fast as it appeared
movies,not_removed,the trailers are definitely comedic i remember being surprised by the drama when i saw it in theaters some of the marketingmessaging might have changed after release though
movies,not_removed,carrie fisher never looked better
movies,not_removed,i found it enjoyable
movies,not_removed,ugovschwarzenegger happy and wishing you the best
movies,not_removed,zum geburtstag viel glück herr schwarzenegger
movies,not_removed,his best movie is terminator
movies,not_removed,dolby cinema surround sound thx both include universal translators in their equipment luckily this is easily transferable to dvd and bluray thats why the sound is crap on pirated movies as the sound isnt licensed
movies,not_removed,iirc in star wars they call it basic in star trek they have universal translators which is how they hand wave the language issue away in marvel they all just speak english
movies,not_removed,its called suspension of disbelief or you can go with the mantra whichever works if youre wondering how he eats and breathes and other science facts then repeat to yourself its just a show i should really just relax edit to add in more seriousness some shows have used various httptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmaintranslatormicrobes to explain it in a hand waving kind of way its basically to keep the story going as spending too much time trying to explain it is not really needed its like sound in space it makes it more fun like having different species being able to talk and everyone not being killed by all the new illnesses instellar travel would bring
movies,not_removed,its not discussed so that language can be abstracted away otherwise youd be reading subtitles through the whole movie
movies,not_removed,i believe the movie makers use a babel fish
movies,not_removed,guardians uses a universal translator chip implant you can see it listed during the rap sheet scene in star wars the majority of people speak basic english but there are some alien species with their own language as for thor i assume it uses tech similar to guardians since asgardians in the mcu are basically aliens
movies,not_removed,my big gripe is how allany historical work tends to have people using a british accent even if theyre in some totally different region gladiator for example if theyre going to speak english why apply a british accent
movies,not_removed,because movie
movies,not_removed,a lot of sci movies and tv shows fall apart if you analyse them too much as well as languages the usage of earth timecalender is also rarely addressed although the stargate movie had the people on the other planet speak another language i found it amusing that virtually every world they visited in the tv series spoke modern english given that earth alone has over languages that very lucky granted i get that it wouldnt be much fun if they had to learn a new language every episode they could of at least made up some language converter
movies,not_removed,several different languages were used in the star wars series
movies,not_removed,well star wars is in a whole other universe that has no earth in it so thats fine its called basic in star wars
movies,not_removed,a lot of fantasy genres use a language that all races know in addition to their native tongues called common ymmv on how well its done
movies,not_removed,in my movies they all speak german
movies,not_removed,inventing a new language and subtitling the whole script would be tedious so i tend to assume the language theyre speaking may not be presentday english at all its simply translated into that to make it more enjoyable and immersive for the audience science fiction often has translators or explains the characters are speaking in a wellknown shared language which is used between species and across worlds thor is an odd one as asgard doesnt seem to have enough regular contact with earth to explain why asgardians can speak english to a modern person and only have a charming slightly archaic feel to their speech despite not speaking to a human since however its implied asgard take somewhat of a policing role and have the means to travel to other realms so maybe they all have the magical equivalent of a universal translator
movies,not_removed,thor is kind of the silliest of them all because you can imagine were watching the people in star wars in through a filter of our own language in a dramatic recreation of their history but in asgard these people have names and customs directly related to northern european cultures i like the thor movies mind but they are gloriously silly like they ride horses they gather at ye mead hall after battle
movies,not_removed,i wish theyd done that in xmen apocalypse watching it in a foreign country with foreign subtitles really killed the movie for me
movies,not_removed,because it would sound far worse if you forced them all to adopt italian accents much of the cast of gladiator was british oliver reed derek jacobi richard harris irish i know etc thats why they all have british accents
movies,not_removed,hell anything falls apart if you look at it from the right angle
movies,not_removed,if you need not only a second cut of the film but an array of deleted scenes to make it a good film its a failure by any measure
movies,not_removed,i meani thought it was a perfectly good movie in theaters
movies,not_removed,is it true they made the male secretary a ditz i heard people on reddit say that and it bothered the hell out of me
movies,not_removed,i didnt hate the film like some i saw it with my family i laughed and thought it was reasonably entertaining though i think the third act fell flat jumping in this never ending whole and falling for seconds with an apparently unlimited piece of rope looked like the worst cgi and just cheesy as hell overall i thought it was a b ill have to give the extended version a chance
movies,not_removed,the movie sucked im glad sony lost million dollars on ittaught them a lessonstop with the remakes and kick leslie jones to the curb
movies,not_removed,i could watch kate kckinnons character weekly i will rewatch it this way thanks movie done with love justscattered cool to the touch nobody was brave enough to tell bill murray bad hat choice you dont throw bill murray out a window maybe it was just the abrupt edit but it stepped on a solid follow up joke theres a newer method of editing dialogue which puts listening actors reaction shots over opposite speakers dramatic conclusion or key points its distracting to me and gb masked the bland villain with it and i liked that actor on spaced clunky lines im a ghostbuster but fun great kids film great special effects needed a rewrite character definition better editing
movies,not_removed,i enjoyed the movie remove leslie jones and improve the movie by a lot
movies,not_removed,tell that to bladerunner
movies,not_removed,this guy gets it
movies,not_removed,tell that to dccinematic
movies,not_removed,extended edition much better just the opening with kristen wigs character adds so much more to her with the deleted scenes they really get to flesh her out and melissas character too
movies,not_removed,why would that bother you hes pretty funny
movies,not_removed,yes and i didnt mind it hemsworth has a lot of the funniest jokes in the film the scene where he discusses his pet made me laugh pretty damn hard
movies,not_removed,its true but they have a lot of fun with it and a nice plot development out of it in the end if you leave all the politics and expectations aside the extended cut plus the deleted scenes is a good movie
movies,not_removed,murray didnt want to be there neither did any of the original cast the sony leaks revealed they were basically blackmailed into this
movies,not_removed,kate mckinnons character was my least favorite part of the movie i think kate mckinnon is great but they kind of trumped her up to be the crazy one and then never give her much crazy to work with she was a walking reaction shot makes me wonder if the script had action lines like holtzmann makes a funny face
movies,not_removed,did you watch the deleted scenes afterwards
movies,not_removed,really from what ive heard jones was the breakout star
movies,not_removed,oh shitttttttt solobolo just dropped the mic
movies,not_removed,invalid blade runner was specifically taken from the director and forced into a format the theatrical edition could be called the studio cut the directors cut is what was made for the theaters same thing happened to ridley with kingdom of heaven these were also very public cases of studio battling a visionary director none of whats been released supports a hack like the guy who directed a remake of ghostbusters actually having some controversial vision like the original blade runner this is the studio trying to save what they can out of that dumpster fire
movies,not_removed,the execs made him cut those pivotal scenes not him thats what i meant that theres a good movie in there before sony screwed it up
movies,not_removed,how do you mean because while suicide squad has made money their films have been across the board embarrassing disasters
movies,not_removed,i assumed they were going for swapping out genders to do their new remake thing but the female secretary in the originals was anything but ditzy
movies,not_removed,sony was talking about trying to blackmail murray into doing ghostbusters when ramis was still alive and murray couldnt care less murray said the reason he did this when he refused to do ghostbusters was he wanted to support these actresses who had been shit on by everyone
movies,not_removed,not in my copy i liked the credit cutaway scenes kate sigourney were awesome
movies,not_removed,if breakout star means annoying and not funny
movies,not_removed,thank you thank you ill start working on my speech right now
movies,not_removed,invalid
movies,not_removed,none of that is supported by whats been released about the film feig was vocally supportive of the finished product hes just not a very good director in long form look at spy that too had an extended cut released of it are you saying that the studio messed with that too its not like were talking about terry gilliam here
movies,not_removed,there are users who keep insisting bvs ultimate cut is some sort of underrated masterpiece
movies,not_removed,none of the characters are analogous to the original its not a straight gender flip
movies,not_removed,nobody had shat on the ladies apart from a minor minor minor part of the comments less than a percentage of all comments on youtube for example everyone hated the movie that was true but the whole narrative with it being about the actresses was bogus and operated by sony
movies,not_removed,fam you dont a speech you dont have a mic to speak with
movies,not_removed,and there are users comparing justin bieber to john lennon
movies,not_removed,ah see i didnt get that from all the hate the movie was catching i myself didnt see it to pass any judgement but i might give it a go now with the extended
movies,not_removed,it had like star reviews on imdb before the movie was released and id say of the commentary i saw on any site was people bragging about how they were doing their part to trash the film specifically because of the female cast the actresses were shit on publicly from the moment it was announced it would be a female cast you cant be serious saying the backlash was minor minor minor it is the biggest backlash against a film before release ive ever seen in my entire life
movies,not_removed,then i guess you werent around for the initial reception of tim burtons batman it caused the studio to panic so bad they held extra events around the country to showcase a hastily put together trailer so people would stop badmouthing it or maybe you missed last temptation of christ where people firebombed theaters playing the film or really anything else except a crappy cashgrab that got hated on for being lazy edit heres also science man to explain it better
movies,not_removed,tim burtons batman that was called upon release the best movie o the decade i remember the release of it there was some initial backlash when it was first announced they were casting mr mom but it wasnt particularly bad i recall the protestors for last temptation of christ but literally didnt see any of them outside of any theaters that i can find omaha has the highest population of catholics per capita of any city in the us and there wasnt a single protester here i wasnt aware that a theater was attacked in paris over it
movies,not_removed,yes batman was called great upon release because it was notice how even the good reviews of ghostbusters are tepid and barely interested in giving it anything but brownie points for having women in it doesnt change the fact that batman featured immeasurable backlash when announced but instead of blaming the audiences for it the studio did the right thing and showed them the product they were working on was worth their time and money then again we can always look at batman and robin which features backlash to this day and it deserves it its an awful movie or hey maybe lets look at the backlash phantom menace gets you know whats the one connecting thing here no other studio but sony tried to spin the backlash as something that was the fault of the audience they were supposed to cater to

movies,not_removed,prisoners
movies,not_removed,amazing film also perfectly fits what op is looking for in most of these kind of films the generic formula is that the main character would be looking for the big bad but he needs to look for the hideout and kill a bunch of minions before the final boss fight in i saw the devil its just the main character and the antagonist chasing and outmaneuvering each other for the entire film
movies,not_removed,the dont know who the antagonist is in either of these both are great films though
movies,not_removed,both of them are protagonists
movies,not_removed,in that case httpsenwikipediaorgwikiusmarshalsfilm
movies,not_removed,un chien andalou is the first i can think of also check out the cremaster cycle and other work by matt barney drawing restraint etc holy mountain and santa sagre by jodowosky are worth seeing and the sets of the cell are pretty awesome horror films by dario argento can be quite surreal suspiria is one of his best
movies,not_removed,you might try valerie and her week of wonders or maya derens meshes of the afternoon or begotten usually that sort of imagery is a part of a film rather than the whole thing jacobs ladder comes to mind some david lynch jodorowsky etc
movies,not_removed,the most surreal fucked up movie ive seen to date is the japanese film
movies,not_removed,salvador dali made one as did several other surrealist artists during the peak of that movement i think some dadaist did as well and andy warhol also tried surrealist film or at least one
movies,not_removed,admittedly ive not seen it yet but you may be interested in
movies,not_removed,lynch films like lost highway and mulholland drive might interest you as might the japanese film gozu
movies,not_removed,try crispin glovers what is it films
movies,not_removed,awesome thanks so much ill look it up right now
movies,not_removed,i loved jacobs ladder and david lynch is really awesome ill have to look up the other stuff you suggested thanks
movies,not_removed,ill have to look into that thanks for the info
movies,not_removed,ive seen mulholland drive and really enjoyed it but i havent seen lost highway so ill definitely look into it ill also look up gozu thanks for all the info
movies,not_removed,thanks ill look into it i know he is an odd individual lol
movies,not_removed,i do not get why sony hired him in the first place
movies,not_removed,his antics at fox have been widely reported over the years this man managed to alienate plenty of talent and almost ran the studio to the ground this is hardly surprising sony should get rid of him as soon as possible
movies,not_removed,not gonna lie i had to look up obstreperous
movies,not_removed,some insiders defended rothman saying that the complaints are the result of his urgent push to make a sea change in the culture at the studio which has languished at or near the bottom of the box office standings for several years sony has sucked for several years now so its funny to hear their failed executives complain that the new guy is the problem he wont let us do business as usual which only led to failed movies in the past lol drainthesonyswamp
movies,not_removed,remember the it seems like everything sony has been doing is basically whats happening in that sketch theyre just shitting out ideas and making movies out of it with no thought i mean theres a fucking animated live action and spin off spiderman movie already in the works what the fuck
movies,not_removed,well im just glad hes gone from fox i remember lots of those production stories from back in the days talk about micro management
movies,not_removed,hes an overreaction to amy pascal who has a reputation for letting movies overrun their budget sony wanted a micromanager who could keep costs down and they went too far in getting one
movies,not_removed,wasnt he an emergency replacement for amy pasqual who got fired after the sony email hack leaked some of her mails where she was calling the president racist names
movies,not_removed,for the lazy noisy and difficult to control synonyms unruly unmanageable disorderly
movies,not_removed,understandable points on the spiderman gripe but to be fair that franchise is their cashcow it is the comic book property that they are trying to ride to the bank ala disneymarvel they just dont quite know how to jumpstart it back into profitability
movies,not_removed,they spent a few months working on a replacement and had a few other good people to choose from
movies,not_removed,i just want to warn against the extended cut which i think is substantially worse than the theatrical version
movies,not_removed,the ending always gets me and by gets me i mean makes me bawl like a little baby
movies,not_removed,fantastic movie
movies,not_removed,this is definitely my favorite movie of all time i think its because the characters feel so human and the setting feels so real its a picturesque view of what you would think it would be like to live in a small town in italy the score from ennio morricone is also my favorite movie score of all time the music capitalizes on the humor romance sadness and joyful moments in order to create an experience that really just overwhelms all of my emotions i dont think the extended cut is that bad but it really does lose a large amount of meaning and the lasting effect that makes the movie so powerful people have differing opinions of what is good and what isnt but i do think that anyone interested in foreign films would do themselves a favor by viewing this
movies,not_removed,i was lucky enough to see this in theaters it made me cry it still makes me cry
movies,not_removed,i cried so hard at the end of this movie love this one
movies,not_removed,great movie always make me feel like im cutting onions
movies,not_removed,it keeps on coming up in my suggestions on netflix ive almost started it a couple times but im never in the mood to read subtitles maybe this is a sign for me to check it out this weekend
movies,not_removed,this is one of my favorite movies of all time i saw it only once and it had such a profound impression on me that i dont want to see it again for fear of spoiling it the director made it as a piece of nostalgia for film lovers and in trying to pay homage to the classics he himself made a classic worthy of standing among them
movies,not_removed,top three movies of all time easily this movie like life is beautiful so poetically sums up humanity
movies,not_removed,i love the movie but this is a pretty low quality post
movies,not_removed,k thanks for the wiki link solid post
movies,not_removed,i may try to watch it again
movies,not_removed,ugh such a schmaltzy movie
movies,not_removed,i really disliked it beware that this is an artsy feely movie thats the best words i can come up with to explain it
movies,not_removed,this is so true the extended cut is a terrible movie the theatrical version is one of my all time favorites a world of difference between the two
movies,not_removed,ive heard it bombed in italy because it was released there in the extended version and miramax basically saved it by cutting it down
movies,not_removed,i watched the extended cut not realizing there was another version and couldnt understand why everyone else had such a different opinion of the ending from me the extra hour shows one of the main characters in a completely different light
movies,not_removed,so whos your herolemme guess michael bay or chris nolan
movies,not_removed,my hero
movies,not_removed,but then i got to thinking about peter sellers portrayal of multiple roles and i think with waltz multilingual background hed be incredible in a role like this not really imo i think waltz is immensely talented and has a very strong screen presence the kind of what you expect from a classic theater actor i cant see him in a character that doesnt actspeaks like waltz himself his portrayal of hans landa and dr schultz are very similar mostly because of how waltz plays them all his roles since then are also exactly the same he was in spectre as blofield playing waltz thats not a criticism thats just how i see theater actorsclassic actors playing themselves in most of their roles one most famous example will be of benedict cumberbatch he is exactly the same in every single role same with classic actors like steve mcqueen james stewart henry fonda harrison ford etc people want them to play themselves is an entirely different subject what peter seller had on all of the above was versatility and its rather difficult thing to find if i had to recast peter seller part of dr strangelove id go for some one like gary oldman or james mcavoy
movies,not_removed,i like spanish sloth hes way more giggly
movies,not_removed,hyperbole
movies,not_removed,you must have not seen many movies then its good but not that good
movies,not_removed,you should watch walk hard the dewey cox story
movies,not_removed,id really like to phoenix reprise the role in a film about the later part of his life
movies,not_removed,and the actors actually sing better than the carter and cash
movies,not_removed,i urge you to watch it again and then if it still fails you give suggestions on movies to watch im telling you reese and phoenix did an outstanding job on this one
movies,not_removed,the wrong kid died
movies,not_removed,i actually believe this after listening to these two past recordings
movies,not_removed,okay just watched that stones bio pic you mentioned youre telling me its better than this film ill have a good laugh sir if that its what you are trying to say waaay outdated
movies,not_removed,you watched a hour film in minutes
movies,not_removed,how does a film get outdated a film might be dated for instance by the fashion or technology shown in the film but thats not relevant for a period piece a movie set in the wont have that problem or is it just because you feel newer equals better
movies,not_removed,both are great films i think what op meant to say was that walk the line is one of his favorite films rather than one of the best of all time
movies,not_removed,if teens cant go it wont make money g if teens wont go it wont make money hence the stigma
movies,not_removed,if its rated theyre not allowed to advertise the film at certain times and in certain places so it essentially takes away a huge chunk of their marketing
movies,not_removed,i dont think theres any stigma towards g ratings as for many theaters just dont show them
movies,not_removed,the mpaa and theater owners associations also limit the amount and ways of advertising an movie at the theater
movies,not_removed,teenagers literally ruin everything
movies,not_removed,oh boy have you not seen any zack snyder movies
movies,not_removed,wait what when is batflecks bare ass shown in the extended cut
movies,not_removed,can you not handle a second of the batbutt this whole post because of a mere second out of a movie lol
movies,not_removed,the moment the story is equally as good as his visuals then that movie will be a sheer masterpiece i personally like most of his movies though im not an overly critical person and i can see why done dont like them but if someone truly says that his movies arent visually compelling even a little bit then i no longer trust that person because that is a lie
movies,not_removed,you should really see that movie itll make you more aware of his visual style and flaws that his style adds to the movie its a gorgeous and boring animated movie with some truly heartfelt moments
movies,not_removed,really i mean youre right but really its in the shadows the most i could make out is the outside of his right ass cheek watch a movie like carlos hell even cillian murphys split second nude shot in days later is more bothersome than pretty much everything snyders shown altogether spend more time in a gym or something try and get comfortable with your body and seeing other peoples
movies,not_removed,hows it dumb
movies,not_removed,i dont think theres anything wrong with having deadpool as your favorite i mean op clearly has no idea what they are talking about but i think it was a perfectly fun movie
movies,not_removed,hey i resemble that remark
movies,not_removed,it is worth a click though because it does have nice excerpts from williams widow which is more the point of the article than this so called terrorist in his brain
movies,not_removed,save you a click oh fuck you
movies,not_removed,its a thing now on reddit i dont entirely get it not reading articles is already a problem on reddit this isnt entirely helping

movies,not_removed,i gave it my best shot
movies,not_removed,wat
movies,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
movies,not_removed,i mean i agree that star trek shoulda won so many varied awesome designs but you chose one of the best from star trek why not with suicide squad like killer croc
movies,not_removed,ive never seen people get upset about a hair makeup oscar also why not use a picture croc or one of those shitty cthulu yokes the actual impressive makeup
movies,not_removed,academy voters didnt watch star trek unfortunately voters arent required to have seen all of the films for whichever category theyre voting on they tend to just core for what theyve seen on some of the more down ballot cats this it has been suggested is why disneypixar dominates animated academy voters dont watch anything else
movies,not_removed,comeoni hate suicide squad as much as anyone but this is ridiculous killer croc was amazing and the evolution of harleys makeup throughout the film was very well done
movies,not_removed,httpscreenrantcomwhysuicidesquadwonoscar aside from simply saying killer croc the makeup done to make most of these characters used a lot of different techniques were often nearly fullbody due to the amount of skin exposed and the makeup for harley and a couple others changed to reflect the battles and rain they had experienced they didnt design what the joker would like they just brought that design to life and did it appropriately they werent responsible for the script the story the editing or any of the things that were actually wrong with the movie
movies,not_removed,its so weird that suicide squad has more oscars than hell or high water
movies,not_removed,the alien should fuck harley quinn and have an alien baby and call it oscar win win
movies,not_removed,i got no dog in this fight but there was some done on that mess of a movie
movies,not_removed,in the movie suicide squad margot robbie play a great role deserve oscar for best bad ass girl in film history
movies,not_removed,but with which one would you rather have sex with
movies,not_removed,i like harley but i dont think she deserves oscar
movies,not_removed,i found my fetish
movies,not_removed,yes
movies,not_removed,it should be a prerequisite of getting a bloody vote in the first place since when was logic a part of the oscars
movies,not_removed,thats what she said
movies,not_removed,its in my hand
movies,not_removed,so much of it is specifically designed to be as inoffensive and safe as possible wouldnt want anyone to have their feelings hurt because they were barred from voting a category they couldnt be fucked to actually watch the pertinent films for smh
movies,not_removed,great example of this in with a lens the shot is in front of a plane landing and while the plane is over a mile away it looks like it is landing right on top of the actors
movies,not_removed,sydney lumet talks about using this to its maximum effect in angry men he started out with wide angle lenses to make the room look more open and then slowly increased the focal length throughout the movie to cause a claustrophobic and suffocating effect

movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,this video pairs with a textbook i used for a film class the book is called looking at movies and runs about bucks but is very thick and has pictures from newer movies like juno and harry potter as well as classics its really informative if you liked this video it may be worth snagging
movies,not_removed,i watched this for film really informative and useful information without it being too long and boring
movies,not_removed,maybe not original but at least its from earlier and has higher quality
movies,not_removed,this was done by a professor at the university of north carolina wilmington if im not mistaken this was actually made in the early and is titled looking at movies the narrator is now the head of the film department there and with whom i did several projects with

movies,not_removed,why the fuck does this post have more upvotes than the video has views
movies,not_removed,so different focal lengths are what give movies their movie look
movies,not_removed,uepiczombie
movies,not_removed,so would it also be different lenses that give different mediums and genres of entertainment their different look as in a soap opera has that one shotone perspective look that sets it apart from other shows but it also has different textures in comparison to an action movie or a nature documentary is this dependent on the quality of the camera or the lense being used
movies,not_removed,i sure hope cory got his drink
movies,not_removed,that focus breathing time to get more expensive glass for movie making
movies,not_removed,this is why i always recomend if someone is starting out photography to have at least one fixed lense i use a because it was my dads but is a bit better to have for day to day shooting kit zoom lenses are great for versatility generally but make it harder to really understand what effect the lens has on the image on top of this their relative apertures f stop often times do not get down as low as a fixed lense or if they do they cost a heck of a lot this is important for depth of field and letting in more light
movies,not_removed,clicked on this because shes hot no regrets
movies,not_removed,seems like a reupload with monetisation of this video
movies,not_removed,my understanding of lenses is a is more like the human eye than a i wonder why they dont use one of those
movies,not_removed,i think i found the
movies,not_removed,this is great to learn from
movies,not_removed,these lenses are making me thirstay
movies,not_removed,this explains what is happening when you use different focal length lenses but why is that happening whats the physics of the lens that makes this happen
movies,not_removed,original video here fake account stolen video
movies,not_removed,shellys pants look peed in
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,focal length you provide it no pay
movies,not_removed,i thought this shot was done by varying that but it turns out to be another trick apparently
movies,not_removed,the number of upvotes on this post is higher than the number of view the video have
movies,not_removed,this is actually pretty excellent for explaining the same concepts other than motion for still photographers my wife still gets upset at me for wanting to change lenses for certain shots i should let her watch this vid
movies,not_removed,hhfdd
movies,not_removed,shout out to the peeps over at rvideoediting its a very small sub but this is perfect for it
movies,not_removed,the narrator sounds like zefrank
movies,not_removed,initially read as fecal lengthwas quite confused
movies,not_removed,they say in the video that we know they are farther away because of our intuitive knowledge of relative size which we know isnt true anymore since they have been able to restore sight to blind people who didnt understand this concept
movies,not_removed,i want whatever drugs cory took before shooting this
movies,not_removed,this is fucking amazing and thank you because i wouldnt have realized otherwize i know this wont help me in my real life but i thank you much the same
movies,not_removed,i like how this bit covers some things specific to cinematographyvideography that involve action most info out there only covers how this works with photography which i know fairly well already however despite how useful it is for direction when it comes to traditional film i find it rather annoying and effectbreaking on films with the immersion there are times youre naturally wanting to focus on things that will never come into focus and if any changes in depth of field occur it can seem odd at times i guess thats a rather new topic but its why i prefer the oldschool over at the movies
movies,not_removed,you can get mind blowing results with the proper backgrounds such as
movies,not_removed,the depth of field is also a great tool for movies avatar is one of the few movies to handle it well
movies,not_removed,thats so
movies,not_removed,nice shout out to my alma mater and degree minor we watched this same video in a few different classes and there are other subjects as well
movies,not_removed,perspective
movies,not_removed,this video made me feel like today is monday and its not damn you shelly
movies,not_removed,teeny tiny cory back there you mean those pixels moving back there
movies,not_removed,oh shit thats corey from the superkiids
movies,not_removed,thank you for uploading this op this is very useful for noobs like myself who need primers in film techniques
movies,not_removed,would love this
movies,not_removed,hey unc wilmington represent
movies,not_removed,thanks for the video but the quality is very first two years of youtube very interesting nonetheless
movies,not_removed,this is seriously messing with me i get what theyre saying about perspective movement through depth and depth of field what i cant understand is how the fov for the plane where shelly is standing always has the same size ie how is shelly roughly the same size in and fl shots assuming a simple single lens assembly shouldnt the fov change for each shot shouldnt i be seeing up to her knees in the shot and up to her upper lip in the shot i havent thought about it for too long but all i can think of is that shellys relative position to the camera changes for each shot
movies,not_removed,hey i watched this in my elective film class
movies,not_removed,i wish people who played video games understood any of this they are always complaining that games dont allow them to set the field of view wide enough but game developers typically want to maintain a certain field of view for artistic and gameplay reasons i personally really dislike the super exaggerated look to things you get with a ultra wide field of view but setting your field of view extremely wide makes gameplay easier so if you allow people to increase the field of view most player will choose to play the game at a setting that looks like crap just because it gives them an advantage but if you restrict the field of view they complain and literally scoff at the idea that choosing field of view is an artistic choice
movies,not_removed,i still remember being downvoted for arguing about this sigh
movies,not_removed,ignores change of camera placement stars
movies,not_removed,nice video can anyone tell me if this looming forest scene in lotrfellowship after frodos line i think we should get off the road is lens trickery like the opvideo describes or a computer effect
movies,not_removed,classic corey
movies,not_removed,shelly is sexy
movies,not_removed,the standardbearer of cinematic tutorial excellence
movies,not_removed,even this little tutorial video has all those credited people this is the reason i gave up indy film making to produce anything of significant you need a large crew the term independent is a misnomer
movies,not_removed,i just really want to loan shelly a bobby pin
movies,not_removed,sorry but i say no to videos trying to show anything visually in friggin
movies,not_removed,scheli didnt like that coffee
movies,not_removed,this and low camera placement is how us game developers make racing game look faster than it is
movies,not_removed,cool
movies,not_removed,this is a great video
movies,not_removed,this doesnt really explain the effects on our perception only on the appearance of the scene and on movement is there a video explaining some common ways different focal lengths and while were at it different aperture settings different angles different ways of moving the camera contribute to our actual perception of a scene of our emotional perception of it
movies,not_removed,shelly needs to move her hair out of her eye or that eye is going to get messed up
movies,not_removed,neat
movies,not_removed,cool
movies,not_removed,another fine example
movies,not_removed,thats a pretty nice pixel they got there someone needs to reupload this video in hd
movies,not_removed,nice
movies,not_removed,the effect is not because of focal length but subject distance
movies,not_removed,if it was so far away how did they get both the actors and the plane in focus at the end of the shot serious question
movies,not_removed,i have to admit that i really didnt understand what was going on in this movie at all
movies,not_removed,here is another
movies,not_removed,it would seriously suck if that plane didnt stop and killed them confident actors
movies,not_removed,mmm now i want to watch that movie gary oldman is the fuckin man
movies,not_removed,gary oldman in his exact jim gordon costume
movies,not_removed,the end of has that amazing sunset that was shot with a very long lens even though the sun was over a mile away
movies,not_removed,the shot looks like bad green screen to me
movies,not_removed,someone in the comments of the video you linked says unfortunately it comes across as goofy comedy i agree he looks like a mime or a clown in front of a plane or like the guy in austin powers that gets run over by the steam roller
movies,not_removed,hnnnnnggggg
movies,not_removed,the plane is somewhat out of focus
movies,not_removed,gotta be honest im not a fan it just looks greenscreened
movies,not_removed,to be technical about it and while the plane is over a mile away it looks like it is landing right on top of the actors plane was not over a mile away in the description it says that the runway was a mile long planes often dont land in the first inch of runway go to the very last inch even if the plane only traveled a quarter mile on the run way the shot is still extremely impressive because the plane hardly changes in size as it travels a quarter mile
movies,not_removed,it has a green screen look initially when the plane is out of focus
movies,not_removed,but why it honestly just looks goofy
movies,not_removed,shelly max cory are all very names the narrators voice is spoton from the clothes could easily pass off as clothes and to top it off that being said i have no idea why as its made in but i liked it
movies,not_removed,its being filmed on stock and its got minimal color grading if any at all probably a light print from the stock and thats all it got done to it pretty similar to the workflows of a lot of the television shows you would see on in the
movies,not_removed,the fed is going to be lowering rates so get your money out of tbills and put it all into waffles tasty waffles with lots of syrup
movies,not_removed,stylistic choice maybe it feels way too not to have been on purpose
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,a lot of people are pointing out the picture quality but i think a big part of it is also the poor audio and slightly belowpar editing i mean the video isnt even scaled properly and the text at the top gets cut off a tiny bit reminds me of the days of converting from vhsminidv into imovie
movies,not_removed,its shot on film with a aspect ratio so that might be a big part of it
movies,not_removed,its like a health class video
movies,not_removed,is it possible to have a wide angle lens with a narrow depth of field or telephoto with wide depth of field
movies,not_removed,was this filmed in des moines iowa
movies,not_removed,i got that vibe too it also looked like they were using a film camera
movies,not_removed,interesting looks more like the early to me id personally guess edit are you kidding me you ripped your top comment off the previous post almost word for word the answer is or just prior it was posted before you should know check the top comment you made with relevant info went looking for an answer learned the top poster is thirsty for worthless internet points btws it never looked like the anyways
movies,not_removed,from his book making movies right that was a great book for beginners in the film industry
movies,not_removed,the thing that bugs me is that they really need to mention that you must change camera position too we know this from the video shelly is at max is at cory is at to keep shelly the same size in the frame for each shot we must move the camera to say from shelly for the wide lens for the normal lens for the telephoto now lets look at the ratios of the distance of the camera to shelly vs distance of shelly to max cory wide shelly to max is shelly to cory normal shelly to max shelly to cory telephoto shelly to max shelly to cory now go back telephoto cory is the same size as normal max and normal cory is the same size as wide max so its not just focal length its camera placement too and how the camera placement changes the relationship of comparative distance between your subjects edit formatting
movies,not_removed,this is the type of thing i was expecting from the video it was interesting to see the technical bits about how focal length and depth of field can be manipulated but the video didnt touch on when filmmakers would use those tools and in which situations not the videos fault but ops post title implied thered be more to it than just the mechanics
movies,not_removed,oooh i watched it recently and i noticed that but i wasnt sure how he achieved the effect thanks for pointing that out
movies,not_removed,love learning things like that especially when its from masterpieces like angry men thanks
movies,not_removed,love that guys enthusiasm
movies,not_removed,perspective
movies,not_removed,im thirsty
movies,not_removed,him spazzing out when it was his turn to be in focus made me spill my water lol
movies,not_removed,im thirsty
movies,not_removed,too much fuckin perspective
movies,not_removed,sea sick as a mf now
movies,not_removed,im freaking out watching this
movies,not_removed,im not seeing anyone else mention this but it isnt actually focal length its just the perspective of where youre placed you can use a lens and crop it to match the same fov of a and theyll look identical other than the resolution difference this is important because a lens on a larger sensorfilm will look different from on a smaller one the example in ops video used a lens on film if you want to replicate the fov on film youd need to use a lens a lens on film is going to look much wider then youve got how the film is actually placed on a stills camera the film moves horizontally on a motion picture camera the film moves vertically as a result the motion picture camera has a smaller frame about the size of a crop frame camera from the stills camera and so a lens on either will look different again this website demonstrates it perfectly httpswwwabelcinecomfov if you want to replicate the cropping theory yourself just use the digital zoom on your phones camera and move it back and forth as you zoom in and out youll see the perspective change even though the physical focal length is fixed
movies,not_removed,😵😵😵
movies,not_removed,this effect is the dolly zoom i believe used in horror films thrillers etc
movies,not_removed,thats inaccurate that gif demonstrates what happens when you change the perspective distance between camera and subject and at the same time change the focal length to keep the subject the same apparent size within the frame changing focal length is nothing more than zooming in or out it does not cause this distortion changing perspective does that
movies,not_removed,juno was almost a decade ago welcome to getting older from now on everything you think was recent was actually in another decade and there are going to be kids everywhere who have no idea what youre talking about
movies,not_removed,by richard barsam
movies,not_removed,where are you finding it for
movies,not_removed,this video and the juno and harry potter scenes were also used for another film textbook called voice vision
movies,not_removed,came here to say this the class was called film appreciation and it was awesome
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,theres also a small subplot corey in the back is really hungry and can be seen eating like an animal near the end when he finally gets pizza when shelly gets offered coffee in the beginning the two guys get jealous and starts it all
movies,not_removed,still
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,fuck the freebooters
movies,not_removed,yeah i just graduated from uncw this semester not with a film degree but i know it is pretty highly regarded
movies,not_removed,ẁere they changing just the focal lengths or also the physical distance between the camera and the scene subjects
movies,not_removed,came for the terminology stayed for shelly
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,hehe she produced and directed a short called help im horny in a world where horniness is a debilitating disease a young man and his friends struggle to find the cure
movies,not_removed,everything i suspected about film studies is true
movies,not_removed,her name in the credits is spelt scheli makes her even hotter
movies,not_removed,sheli can get it
movies,not_removed,the main effect comes from the physical distance to subject the focal length just changes the angle of view if they started in the same spot and went from wide to telephoto you would just see the actors nose and no difference in the relationship between subject and background
movies,not_removed,both
movies,not_removed,as others have said also the distance is being changed and this is actually really the key element the effect is most easily understood once you think about proportionate rather than absolute distances compare two cases of filming object a short focal length but camera closer to a and long focal length but with camera further away from a so that the size of a relative to the total frame is the same in both cases consider a second object of the same size b thats x feet behind object a in both filming cases b is x feet behind a but because the distance between the camera and a is larger in case the extra x feet to b represents a proportionally smaller distance in that case than in case as a result in case b is proportionally less out of focus and appears proportionally closer in size to a than in case
movies,not_removed,if cory never made it in hollywood its probably due to nepotism he will never be a tycoons offspring like say a julia louis dreyfuss ed norton or an armie hammer and he was not spawned by two actors like say a kate hudson angelina jolie or ben stiller cory would have had to work a lot of shit jobs to keep up and probably do lots and lots of extra work and sadly miss out on some great jobs that the directors best friends son just landed i do wonder what restaurant cory works at today
movies,not_removed,yeah same i was like wow ive never even heard of this school crazy world we live in
movies,not_removed,never ceases to amaze me how people bitch about the quality of free content
movies,not_removed,illumimati that or the fact that youtube view count updates like a day late
movies,not_removed,not really rather more the carefully selected focal lengths but more so the colour grading and even more so the professional lighting and insanely expensive quality optics
movies,not_removed,you can tag people on reddit
movies,not_removed,as the other comment says it definitely has to do with different film mediums ken levine a well known comedy writer has a blog and talked about when they were making cheers and almost ended up using magnetic tape instead of film
movies,not_removed,he found the cooler
movies,not_removed,youtube freezes their view counter on new videos that experience large numbers very quickly shame so many people are watching this monetised video instead of the original that was uploaded years previous
movies,not_removed,i believe in addition to focal length it isalso a function of sensorfilm size for instance on a full frame dslr a normal lens has a focal length while a crop sensor normal lens has a focal length thats because a crop sensor is i think about the size of a full frame so it sounds like for film a focal length is roughly normal
movies,not_removed,the focal length is nothing but an optical crop what actually changes perspective is the physical distance between the camera and its subject nobody ever seems to talk about that tho
movies,not_removed,it is literally the shape and size of the lens and the optical interfaces that effect it if you take the same lens and put it underwater the focal length will change etc lenses of this type work based on refraction when light hits a boundary of differential indices of refraction two materials in which the relative speed of light is different the light is refracted according to the laws of physics
movies,not_removed,oh id definitely pee in her pants
movies,not_removed,that is a httpsenwikipediaorgwikidollyzoom you move the camera inout as you zoom it keeps the subject the same size but distorts the background
movies,not_removed,youre gonna let her out of the basement and let her on the youtube sounds like youre youre getting a little lax
movies,not_removed,intuitive knowledge and innate knowledge are different you can gain intuition on a subject through experience
movies,not_removed,shellys relative position to the camera changes for each shot yup the camera backs way off to maintain composition between the shots
movies,not_removed,s
movies,not_removed,the plane gets closer to them as it lands the start of the landing was over a mile away
movies,not_removed,im sure this isnt it but it looks kinda shitty to me like the actors are just standing in front of a green screen that they superimposed the shot of the plane onto
movies,not_removed,because its bright and sunny out and they probably closed down the aperture a fair bit to get deep focus to keep the plane and actors in focus but with a lens you still get depth of field a mile out
movies,not_removed,how did they get both the actors and the plane in focus at the end of the shot possibly with one of httpsenwikipediaorgwikifrazierlens
movies,not_removed,i am not totally sure but i believe you can make two objects be more easily in focus by having them far from the camera and the actors here are far away
movies,not_removed,the iris was probably stopped down pretty low which would increase the depth of field so the plane could stop behind them still be in focus while keeping the line of trees a mile away out of focus
movies,not_removed,maybe gradually decreasing the aperture as the plane got closer and adjusting whatever exposure differences that created in post
movies,not_removed,i imagine they paired a take where the camera was focused on the plane with a take where the camera was focused on the men
movies,not_removed,i watched it at the cinema with a friend at the time we both enjoyed it and followed what was happening then we left and suddenly realised we had no idea what was going on in retrospect
movies,not_removed,this is basically me with every john le carré movie
movies,not_removed,i watched it on a plane having been awake for about hours and not being able to sleep on said plane i still have absolutely no idea what the movie was about even vaguely or even any of the characters names
movies,not_removed,i feel a little better now it was a difficult movie
movies,not_removed,it categorically helps to know whats going on prior to viewing the george smiley series of novels is pretty dense when it comes to plotilne and tinker tailor is about half way through the overarching story imagine theyd only made harry potter and the order of the phoenix or the middle section of the two towers its an incredible feat of film making to make the story even remotely accessible but even having listened to the whole series on the radio i found i had to go back after watching the film just to make sense of it
movies,not_removed,thanks that led me to httpsyoutubeddiwoggowqo which led me to more fun to watch and amazing pilots
movies,not_removed,its over a mile away
movies,not_removed,i would bet that plane was well under control before it stopped it was likely moving forward under the direction of the pilot and not because of the forward momentum of the landing it likely only got as close as it it did because they wanted it to not because thats the soonest it could be stopped and of course its hard to tell how close it actually is
movies,not_removed,i like all actors in the movie but personally i didnt understand the movie for shit you may like it though
movies,not_removed,have you seen the movie or are you just making this statement out of context
movies,not_removed,goofy it shows us that one of these men is infinitely more confident than the other
movies,not_removed,this is how people looked in
movies,not_removed,it looks already during the intro pan through the trees its the film stock its shot on that has a signature color dynamic range and sharpness or lack of
movies,not_removed,im going with the soft color grade the color correction looks very to me
movies,not_removed,it was spelt scheli according to the credits
movies,not_removed,hi everbody im huell howswer we are now at the college of university of north carolina wilmington with the students of the film studies department discussing focal length
movies,not_removed,the is killing it for me i kept trying to figure out who they were racking focus to who are you focusing on everyone is blurry gah
movies,not_removed,the narrator sounds like the guy who does the true facts animal videos on yt
movies,not_removed,thats a lot more than lenses arent what determine pixel ratio the type and setting of the camera do
movies,not_removed,this is the correct answer
movies,not_removed,colour grading or just colour response of film make a huge difference to the look of a piece of film modern productions are strongly colour graded and the contrast is punched up but then if you look at a colour movie from the vs one from the they again look very different
movies,not_removed,well thats just like your perspective man
movies,not_removed,but if this was the shes now at least years old
movies,not_removed,thats what i was thinking i felt like a larger resolution would allow one to see the differences more easily
movies,not_removed,probably footage is stolen from other channel and intentionally downgraded to deceive automatic copyright check just look at that channel only random clips all uploaded yesterday all ripped from somewhere else all in
movies,not_removed,seriously i switched it off immediately when youre trying to give me a visual lesson in films dont fucking give me a video any lower than
movies,not_removed,it tells you right in the video where it was filmed
movies,not_removed,north carolina i think
movies,not_removed,it literally says shot on so you just might be right
movies,not_removed,calm down well that was never my intention i just happend to still wonder why its so i dont know why such a short post got so much upvotes anyway i was just casually browsing during my train ride
movies,not_removed,yep i had a supervisor who kept throwing books at me at one point and he was basically putting me through film i think lol between making movies jaws memories from marthas vineyard spielberg truffaut me bob balabans journal from close encounters and youll never eat lunch in this town again by julia phillips
movies,not_removed,another interesting fact not quite focal based but aperture based stanley kubrick wanted to use completely natural candle light in some scenes of barry lyndon but could not get it to look right so he ended up using a lens from the apollo moon missions with an extremely wide aperture like iirc for comparison most lenses top out at around which let enough light in for the scene to be usable along with what i suspect was some pushpull work in post
movies,not_removed,anytime check out lumets book for more of that stuff his chapters on editing are fascinating too
movies,not_removed,what
movies,not_removed,i used to have nightmares as a kid that were kind of like that really fucking weird
movies,not_removed,the biggest part that i think everyone is missing is camera placement everyone always seems to scream look what happens when we change focal length but then never mentions that theyre changing the camera position too camera placement is just as important actually probably more than focal length edit comparative how telephoto cory is the same size as normal max and normal cory is the same size as wide max this is because of the how camera placement changes the distance
movies,not_removed,you can use a lens and crop it to match the same fov of a no you cant you can not crop the wider image from the gif no match the one with the longest focal length the object itself looks different and the background has nothing to to one with the other and no digital zoom does not simulate a focal length change its just cropping
movies,not_removed,its a pretty weird feeling i used to think that started at or something but considering im not quite and its already happening it seems i was wrong that band has a new album didnt the last one come out recently yeah it was so thats pretty recent and also ten years ago
movies,not_removed,yep thats the one
movies,not_removed,i think he meant to write
movies,not_removed,i quickly googled it and saw it on barnes and noble for that cheap this book comes with a dvd so make sure purchase accordingly to whet here you want it or not
movies,not_removed,true i just feel theres less blocking going on but it might just be me
movies,not_removed,asshole is raking in all the ad money i also thought the relatively low quality of the video the content and the date it was uploaded to youtube didnt add up
movies,not_removed,hi tim
movies,not_removed,or stayed for the terminology came for shelly
movies,not_removed,scheli
movies,not_removed,very fitting
movies,not_removed,given this video is the only post by op i assume it is another scam account
movies,not_removed,why are you being downvoted youre absolutely right
movies,not_removed,original comment here fake account stolen comment jk its spambots all the way down
movies,not_removed,its kinda weird that they left out the most important thing the distance out of the explanation
movies,not_removed,httpiimgurcomocwzacqjpg
movies,not_removed,dont forget dynamic range of the sensoror filmstock theres only so much you can do with lighting if you only have a stop range to work with and its very noticable compared to the professionally used arri with stops of dynamic range
movies,not_removed,birdemic ticks all the boxes then
movies,not_removed,ya
movies,not_removed,oh that makes sense thanks for the clarification
movies,not_removed,exactly the video is informative but leaves out a very important part of the equation telephoto lenses do not compress perspective they simply magnify the compression that is already there by virtue of how far the camera needs to be placed from the subject
movies,not_removed,wat
movies,not_removed,thanks seems too dramatic an effect for that but that seems to be the case seems there would be some elegant way to do it with the lens alone with a variable focal length
movies,not_removed,of course
movies,not_removed,til shots that i thought were chroma keyd were actually just telephoto lenses sometimes
movies,not_removed,this isnt even the fucking answer they used a smaller aperture high f stop to have more of the depth of field in focus
movies,not_removed,youre getting downvoted but i agree it looks more realistic at the end when the plane parks but the rest does look a little greenscreeny
movies,not_removed,im with you on this one the colorslighting are pretty much right on but you are dealing with a long sharp lens because of this the actors end up in a very sharp focal plane also since it is so long you cut out the surrounding area out including the ground so you lose the sense of space this leads to the actors not feeling like they are in the same shot as the planenot in the same space first time i had this happen to me i was filming a sit down interview i wanted to fit some cars behind my actor so i used a prime lens for some width well he was sharp focused as a razor the background was out of focus it was tight on him and the background had more tungsten light whereas his was daylight this was the first time i noticed this separation it killed me he looked so green screen some coloring helped but still it was a lesson in lenses lighting and shot geometry since then ive noticed this on various shoots ive been on and in various movies wanna see a bad example go watch all of the movie a million ways to die in the west at least half of that movie looks green screened i kept wondering if it was and it took me out of the whole story unfortunately this will only get more difficult to deal with lenses have only become sharper and digital cinema is all about resolutionsharpness and its a big deal for camera manufacturers to increase these things this means that your focus is sharper than ever and if you arent careful you can make a scene look very fake as for the shot in tinker tailor they did it for good reason and to good effect that plane is like a shark coming at them gives a sense of apprehension adding weight to the actors words unfortunately i just dont like it its entirely my opinion and personal though id have wanted their feet in there too to give more of a sense of they space they and the plane were sharing
movies,not_removed,by putting the actors right at the point where infinity focus begins everything behind them will be in focus regardless of aperture
movies,not_removed,i had the same experience i think it has to do with the non linear nature combined with the fact that youre never sure when things are happening relative to where the movie began
movies,not_removed,yeah like who was the bad guy i remember one guy was on house arrest at the end of the thing i think the problem about remembering the plot for me is that the only actor i knew was gary oldman so he is the only name i can remember but like in the departed you can be like matt damon did such n such while jack nicholas and alec baldwin and never have to say their characters names
movies,not_removed,i felt so great during the first half of primer was confident i knew what was happening then all of a sudden it was over and i felt like i completely missed the point of like plot twists
movies,not_removed,if youre into reading id suggest you pick up his novels its pretty typical to be confused for the first half or more but he ties the story together very well at the end
movies,not_removed,dont worry last summer i read the book and was left clueless
movies,not_removed,thatsthejokejpg
movies,not_removed,yes at the beginning of landing its probably like by the time it stops
movies,not_removed,im a big fan of john le carrés spy novels im on my or ive lost count if you liked the movie without fully understanding it id suggest the book and other books in the smiley series the spy who came in from the cold for one was excellent i love gary oldman and i he played a great george smiley although smiley is supposed to be short fat and a bad dresser
movies,not_removed,out of context based on some other comments and a comment from the vimeo page its just that some people say it adds tension to the scene but i think it looks comedic the way he pauses every couple seconds instead of ruhsing through his line to get out of the way
movies,not_removed,hey i dont look oh shit that was six years ago
movies,not_removed,actual or hipsters ahead of the curve you make the call
movies,not_removed,in north carolina
movies,not_removed,id love to watch a short video in this style that addressed the look of film throughout the decades
movies,not_removed,her real name is michelle apparently
movies,not_removed,true facts about the cuttlefeesh
movies,not_removed,the guy how short the internet memory is ze frank did youtube videos before youtube existed he created communities and inspired countless cool things among them the vlogbrothers sure hes not been very active these last few years but a show with zefrank is a milestone
movies,not_removed,wat the video on youtube that we are commenting has a max resolution of
movies,not_removed,from my perspective the jedi are evil
movies,not_removed,i was going to argue but if she were to graduate high school in and was in college in she could be close to i was in when i graduated high school im now hearing that a young college student in the would be now yikes really gives some perspective there
movies,not_removed,nah the human eye cant see past
movies,not_removed,has a much nicer bokeh
movies,not_removed,i didnt know resolution affected focal length
movies,not_removed,heres the i believe it has the same quality but is uploaded by the original person lets use theirs instead
movies,not_removed,you should also check out mamets on directing film like lumets book it dives into a bygone era of filmmaking but is still a great read for anyone in the industry
movies,not_removed,its called httpsenwikipediaorgwikidollyzoom
movies,not_removed,lol yeah me too it was about the bottom part of a door below the hinges where it touches the floor
movies,not_removed,does httpsenwikipediaorgwikialiceinwonderlandsyndrome sound familiar
movies,not_removed,im not saying crop the gif im saying take a pic on a lens and a lens using the same camera without moving then crop the to match the fov of the and the perspective will look identical i saw a good blog post somewhere demonstrating it but cant find it now in the gif the camera is moving back and forth alongside the focal length being changed which is where the perspective difference is coming from its not the focal length changing that the point about digital zoom just cropping is that a focal length essentially just crops the image it doesnt affect the perspective cropping gets the exact same effect as a different focal length it just means the resolution has to be lost
movies,not_removed,it starts the moment you get out of college next youll have a conversation youve had a thousand times before but now your references are outdated like who is the most beautiful actress obvious answer jennifer connelly who is now years old but she looks great right i mean i just saw her in uh a beautiful mind fifteen years ago when she was no wait i meant blood diamond ten years ago when she was
movies,not_removed,thanks i kinda figured after searching amazon but i remained hopeful
movies,not_removed,thanks for the heads up i didnt even think of barnes noble when i thought of book stores i used to go there a lot before amazon took over the entire shopping front
movies,not_removed,there is but its still a little too potato to demonstrate lenses
movies,not_removed,or came for the terminology came for shelly
movies,not_removed,must be a nickname
movies,not_removed,jokes on you they both are click this video no this is the original click this one double the clicks
movies,not_removed,gilbert is another spambot check some of the replies to its comment history
movies,not_removed,they used a similar trick with the lord of the rings films to have hobbits stood further away than gandalf etc so that they looked shorter rather than doing it digitally all the time
movies,not_removed,the whole movie got all kinds of critical praise and i am usually down with filmyavant garde stuff but i found it dull as dirt
movies,not_removed,hes getting downvoted because the entire point of the video is that its not greenscreen i agree that it looks kind of like that but thats supposed to be a byproduct of their technique not actual greenscreen
movies,not_removed,man ive watch it at least times and im just now beginning to feel like i understand it i think next time i watch it ill have the last few questions answered such a stellar film
movies,not_removed,i started reading the spy who came in from the cold but got bored with it to my shame ill give it another go sometime
movies,not_removed,i am working my way through his novels chronologically and they get longer and more complex the kindle is a godsend for scanning back to recall where and when a character using whichever workname first appeared
movies,not_removed,thatsthejokejpg im sorry the resolution is really low here is thatsthejokepng
movies,not_removed,i love gary oldman and i he played a great george smiley although smiley is supposed to be short fat and a bad dresser maybe one of the best looks for a spy completely average forgettable and therefore quickly dismissed andor underestimated by everyone
movies,not_removed,i would urge you to see the film in that case most film scenes that take big risks like this one often come across a bit silly outside the intended context
movies,not_removed,yupp those people are all long dead by now makes you think
movies,not_removed,so i have been having these moments crop a lot but i am also noticing that everyone else has been too is this another baadermeinhof phenomenon and i am noticing everyone realizing it isnt the year they think theyre in after noticing it myself or was everyone born in and we just all sorta experience these episodes at the same time
movies,not_removed,dont ask me man
movies,not_removed,mischeli
movies,not_removed,irrelevant since the human eye isnt capable of seeing beyond resolution
movies,not_removed,i dont like its course and gets everywhere
movies,not_removed,this is what happens when you perspective a stranger in the ass this is what happens when you perspective a stranger in the ass
movies,not_removed,i know right looks like years ago but its were gettin old mike
movies,not_removed,perspective
movies,not_removed,were you held back a couple years i only ask because i graduated in and im
movies,not_removed,or fps
movies,not_removed,underrated
movies,not_removed,it doesnt but particularly low resolutions affects how the significance of a particular focal length can be demonstrated
movies,not_removed,cool way to try this out is film while being the passenger of a car aim straight ahead down the road and zoom inout with the camera while the car is driving forward bonus effects if you have mountains and forests in view they look like popup planes cut outs placed in front of each other like on a stage
movies,not_removed,for me i was usually in the middle and everything else was moving further away but also closer growing in size while shrinking
movies,not_removed,damn it does thats exactly it
movies,not_removed,yall are complaining about nothing its not to demonstrate the sharpness of lenses its to demonstrate the characteristics of focal lengths the latter is still extremely clear in
movies,not_removed,or stayed for the terminology stayed for shelly ahh shit
movies,not_removed,haha that is an evil trick
movies,not_removed,lotr used a ton of techniques for this including scalable props especially cool are the dolly shots done to force perspective edit better link
movies,not_removed,which is an effect that totally falls apart in hence peter jackson doing for the hobbit much to ian mckellens dismay
movies,not_removed,i guess that forest scene where the wraight chases them on a horse the first time was something related they did a weird thing to make the forest road seem to shrink towards the camera
movies,not_removed,of course we know that its not a green screen because the op indicated that but if you were watching this movie without that context given you might mistake it for a green screen
movies,not_removed,i showed my partner it for the first time last night ive seen it about times too occasionally i would pause and explain a few things to her as the movie disposes of show dont tell and replaces it with dont show or tell fuck your audience let them suffer so i would watch some with her and when i felt a question building i would pause and explain what i now know after all my watches and i still get lost in the section where granger shows up and shit gets psychotic and dark and weird
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,yeah theyre tough i agree with popular opinion that thats the best one the action really does pick up so you might try it again
movies,not_removed,tracking characters is probably the hardest part most of them are regular looking joes eventually i just gave up on that the first time through for me it was much easier to track them the time
movies,not_removed,agree one of the things i really like about john le carrés books is that almost all of the events and characters seem plausiblerealistic which makes sense since he actually worked for and before becoming an author
movies,not_removed,i knew someone from you know what hes doing now
movies,not_removed,only the people who are experiencing it will talk about it otherwise people just skip through the uninteresting comment
movies,not_removed,i was born in can confirm
movies,not_removed,it could be related to the general aging of the crowd of people you associate with combined with your own recognition of a change in your perception of the passage of time the discussion of which you would previously have ignored or dismissed being the young puck you were but which now is relevant to your own experience
movies,not_removed,i dont get the reference but im guessing and hoping thats a joke lol
movies,not_removed,this perspective will not stand
movies,not_removed,perspective
movies,not_removed,i was held back in grade i should have graduated in at age plus i guess im for a couple more months august birthdate
movies,not_removed,im sorry i cant hear you over all the jpeg
movies,not_removed,i remember when i first saw all they did in lotr and wishing i hadnt seen it it is done incredibly well but if youre aware of what they did it often seems like a cant unsee moment makes it harder to get through some scenes
movies,not_removed,wow they really committed to making that shit look legitimate
movies,not_removed,acting these days seems like it would suck
movies,not_removed,good ol dolly zoom httpsenwikipediaorgwikidollyzoom tho in that case basically one in reverse
movies,not_removed,yeah that effect is called a dolly zoom httpsenmwikipediaorgwikidollyzoom
movies,not_removed,oh now i understand his comment he said im sure this isnt it in reference to what hes about to say it seemed to me that he was referencing what the video claimed that might be why hes getting a bad reaction
movies,not_removed,yeah thats a chunk thats still pretty fuzzy for me im starting to get it sorted in my head but not enough to explain it im also trying to sort out exactly who the viewer is as the narrator is speaking directly to you and explaining everything i think its a relevant detail that nobody seems to discuss that ive seen
movies,not_removed,thanks but personally the movie is a bit like my white whale i adore mind bending and puzzle movies and so far primer is the best at it and i have to deconstruct it and figure it out on my own to be fully satisfied
movies,not_removed,fps joke
movies,not_removed,nobody fucks with the perspective
movies,not_removed,august too birthday buddies edit also sorry to bring up the being held back thing but youre dont ever forget until august when youre
movies,not_removed,okay great
movies,not_removed,makes you wonder how peter jackson sees those movies
movies,not_removed,he actually had a mild break down on set and said something like this isnt why i became an actor during the filming of the hobbit from my understanding pretty much all of his scenes with the dwarveshobbits were him alone on a green screen sources httpsukmoviesyahoocomianmckellenbrokedownoverhobbitgreenscreensceneshtml
movies,not_removed,i liked it it really freaked me out at the time so much cool work went into lotr d
movies,not_removed,yeah probably could have worded it better but fuck it at this point
movies,not_removed,i think its implied that aaron is speaking a message to the aaron aaronabe that were drugged and kept from knowing the machines work by abe potentially thats how i see it in my head hes trying to ensure the idea propagates whereas abe seems to want to shut it down forever
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,sort of the reverse of the matrix quote with blonde redhead etc he just sees the lines of code the instructions to the actors
movies,not_removed,yeah i considered that but the ending narration doesnt really support it as i recall
movies,not_removed,id believe it hell id believe it was shot in one of the producers basements everything about that movie looked like something made for on demand or straight to dvd
movies,not_removed,there are probably many occasions when i havent noticed it because its been done so well on the other hand sometimes they use cgi for the weirdest things that could have easily been shot but now look completely out of place in cgi
movies,not_removed,cinema sins on youtube did a video on rise of an empire and there was something like over separate slow motion scenes edit
movies,not_removed,most watching movie on youtube
movies,not_removed,not remembering it correctly
movies,not_removed,i think youre remembering it wrong i thought the same thing but then i realized that ive seen so many movies with dead bodies in bath tubs that my brain was probably just associating them with each other
movies,not_removed,youre remembering it wrong
movies,not_removed,source from their official tweet
movies,not_removed,madha gaja rajamgr is an tamil action comedy movie direction by sundarc the movie has vishal krishnan varalakshmi anjali santhanam and arya doing guest appearance in this movie
movies,not_removed,god please dont new line just let it be great on its name and dont sully its name
movies,not_removed,you know they wont do the knife fight justice they also wont get that the girl actress carried a lot of weight in this movie as she reacted to her changing circumstances her performance was above the typical damsel in distress
movies,not_removed,omfg no that movie is great as it is dont make a whitewashed hollywood copy out of it
movies,not_removed,hollywood really doesnt respect its consumers
movies,not_removed,michael scott gif
movies,not_removed,did no one learn from old boy
movies,not_removed,i agree as much as i love those types of films hasnt the concept of the retired guy with a secret past forced to come out of retirement to save a girl or get revenge overdone by now man on fire taken the equalizer john wick
movies,not_removed,definitely the little girl was insanely good
movies,not_removed,see i dont even mind the plot rehash as long as its done well for example john wick is one of the best american action movies ive seen in quite some time my problem is that its obviously just a cash grab this american remake is not going to be as good as the korean film its just not studios are just seeing how well american audiences are taking to korean action movies so they think if they shit out a quick remake well go see it unfortunately they are correct too as i will more than likely pay to go see it lol
movies,not_removed,i can see what your saying about plot rehash john wick and a man from nowhere all had a simple story but the execution was awesome the selling point for this remake will probably be which director and actor they choose
movies,not_removed,very true thatll be everything
movies,not_removed,from bronsons wiki page on remand in woodhill he took a civilian librarian hostage and demanded an inflatable doll a helicopter and a cup of tea from police negotiators he released the hostage after being disgusted when he broke wind in front of him
movies,not_removed,transcript things bronson is being quoted as saying by hardy in italics my relationship with charlie grew from phone calls i remember when he first called me up he goes uh he used to leave message after message on my answerer this was about three years ago he goes god fuckin hell tom its easier to get a hold of fuckin santa claus than you son ah well everybody wants to ill call again and hed call and its like boop message and eventually it goes and i pickup the phone and its six oclock and he goes ah i gotcha i fuckin gotcha havent i and i said charlie and he goes hello mate how you doin im like oh im good he goes uh whats going on and i thought uhhh and id just split up with my girlfriend at the time and i thought oh well do you know what im not going to beat around the bush im just gonna tell him straight cause you know break the ice and im like oh im in a bit of a bad way at the moment and he goes oh yeah whats the matter i go yeah its you know im just not comfortable you know im saying goodbye to somebody that i really love and im not happy im not in a good space do you know what i mean i cant be with a woman cant be without one i realize that you know i probably have a relationship with my mother do you know what i mean that is infusing you know infiltrated all my relationships with women i always find myself stuck in a triangle that im trying to break this pattern and its really painful its like therapy with charlie bronson the first time i ever spoke to him i go i always find myself repeating the same pattern expecting a different outcome insanity and all and i just need releasing from this you know like i gotta release myself i gotta do the work on it i dont know how to blah blah blah and he goes right right tom yeah he goes did you uh do you remember the floods what in oxford yeah the floods do you remember the floods yeah he goes do you remember that boy who got his foot stuck in a grate and the river kept rising and it kept rising and it kept rising and eventually they tried to get him out and he drowned yeah well that wouldnt have happened to me right do you want to know why yeah yeah sure because id have said cut it off now tom what im trying to say is right what im trying to say is son sometimes youve gotta cut a little piece of yourself off yeah no matter how much it hurts in order to grow yeah in order to move on do you know what i mean what are you having for your tea oh im having a steak oooooh you cunt i fuckin love a steak mate whats going on right outside your window i was like fucking hell this guy is dope
movies,not_removed,fuckin ell this guy is dope great story
movies,not_removed,my relationship with charlie grew up calls she called me before he said he used to give about three years ago after leaving a message on my answer phone message he said fucking you than you are to get hold of tom ah this santa claus in hell well you know what everyone wants umwat
movies,not_removed,the video didnt want to load for me so if anyone else is having the same problem heres a copy of it
movies,not_removed,tip avoid the write up and watch the video
movies,not_removed,for anyone interested a phone interview with charles bronson in prison tom hardy nailed his voice
movies,not_removed,that is one of the best minutes of listening and visual pleasure i could have ever spent in my life
movies,not_removed,that article was written by someone in the midst of an aneurism i didnt get to the video it was an emergency i had to get the journalist help before it was too late
movies,not_removed,yet another botwritten article get better bots geez
movies,not_removed,sometimes youve gotta cut a little piece of yourself off yeah no matter how much it hurts in order to grow didnt one of the characters say that in legends as well
movies,not_removed,i either had an aneurysm this morning or that was the worst written article ever
movies,not_removed,i am confused isnt charles bronson an actor
movies,not_removed,what the fuck is going on with hardys accent only time he sounds normal is when hes doing his bronson voice
movies,not_removed,my relationship with charlie grew up calls is that even a sentence stopped reading
movies,not_removed,grammatical inconsistencies in this article is worse than reading helen kellers diary best part of the write up was in the comments
movies,not_removed,fookinell that was a great story
movies,not_removed,itt not the movie star
movies,not_removed,y
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i never get tired of this video
movies,not_removed,i thought i was having a stroke trying to read this shit
movies,not_removed,one thing i would say is that bronson is not a prolific criminal the reason he is famous in the uk is because he has been kept in prison and almost always solitary primarily for not following prison rules disorder his rap sheet does not match his time in nick theres a reason the film is a psychological drama and thats because bronsons known for his head and not actually his actions and its former which hes still in prison for and not the latter hence why there is periodical outcry over it hence why someone wrote a screenplay all about his mind
movies,not_removed,holy fuck does my brain hurt after reading that from the first comment on the articles page is worse than reading helen kellers diary
movies,not_removed,i didnt really get the draw of the movie i thought id love it but it ended up being just dull
movies,not_removed,whos charles bronson why is glorifying this criminal okay
movies,not_removed,that moment when your farts are so bad even your hostage taker is forced to let you go because of them
movies,not_removed,note to self fart if taken hostage
movies,not_removed,dont see the need for this transcript considering the stellar article that accompanies the video
movies,not_removed,thank you for this transcript on the video turned my volume all the way up still didnt understand a word
movies,not_removed,interesting that part about cutting a part of yourself off to grow was part of hardys dialogue as ronnie in legend too
movies,not_removed,that train wreck of an article is worth looking at simply because its so bad its like watching a grammatical accident happening in slow motion my favourite line i picked up the phone and its got your six oclock and he is going if you have not been fucking
movies,not_removed,i think the write up was written by charles bronson after he headbutted a few too many guards
movies,not_removed,thanks for this thought toms rendition was very cartoony until i listened to this its spot on the guy is out there suppose thats what happens when youre shut in a hole for and he wasnt in the best of places to start with
movies,not_removed,watched legend not too long ago and i knew i heard him say the same thing somewhere
movies,not_removed,im fairly certain that generated would be a better verb to describe how that article was created
movies,not_removed,charles bronson is also the name of this famous british criminal made a movie about it was toms first big role
movies,not_removed,must admit had to google
movies,not_removed,sounds like an irish kid from kilburn with a jamaican best mate which makes sense coz his muvvas irish and to the second half well that just happens in london sometimes melting pot does sound slightly affected though
movies,not_removed,he didnt murder people or rape them or anything just broke laws then broke the laws inside prisons hes served something like years for essentially an armed robbery something people get for
movies,not_removed,hes a bad one arguably britains hardest criminal ex bare knuckle boxer whos spent most of his time in prison the reason hes famous is his antics he once kept iranian terrorists hostage in his cell and forced them to tickle his feet
movies,not_removed,im guessing you dont like martin scorsese films
movies,not_removed,im chowing down on cabbage before i go to the bank in future
movies,not_removed,he might also be triggered the wrong way
movies,not_removed,i was worried i was having a stroke reading that
movies,not_removed,it read like a rsubredditsimulator article
movies,not_removed,hahahaha
movies,not_removed,i read it four fuckin times and was questioning my knowledge of the language until this
movies,not_removed,its like they played the tape recorded interview into shitty voice recognition software and didnt proof it just put it up as is
movies,not_removed,reads like something from rsubredditsimulator
movies,not_removed,looks like text to speech but i dont know why its better to have that than just the video
movies,not_removed,or by one of the guards after bronson had headbutted him too many times
movies,not_removed,youre welcome i thought so too the first time seeing the movie i had a hard time sitting through it until after researching for awhile and the whole movie seems pretty accurate to the real story i just couldnt fathom what being in that kind of isolation for so long would do to the mind
movies,not_removed,i think hes floating between accents from roles no way thats a london thing no one i know talks like that
movies,not_removed,broke laws violently
movies,not_removed,thats pretty weird
movies,not_removed,i thought it was floridas commissioner of the department of agriculture but this makes makes more sense
movies,not_removed,thank you
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i think it was written by headbutts directly from charles bronsons forehead to the keyboard
movies,not_removed,i dont talk like that but certainly could do it quite easily and have mates that do but youre probably right altho i cant think what film could ask for that accent
movies,not_removed,google him see what he did to his art teacher
movies,not_removed,texttospeech then google translate
movies,not_removed,thats pretty spot on actually
movies,not_removed,dont think i want too
movies,not_removed,what no this movie is a rerun the global surveillance subplot is at best a mcguffin to move the plot forward if youve seen the other bourne films youve seen this one just a little different motivation but otherwise the same sort of thing
movies,not_removed,amazing voice acting by holly hunter in this scene
movies,not_removed,i heard that originally they werent going to use the insert text here annotations but the director thought they added to the suspense
movies,not_removed,there a children aboard the plane my stomach drops every time she says it her desperation in calling off the strike is incredible and the save right at the moment of impact most movies even now would choose ramping right then but the execution is done amazingly in real time and our relief still doesnt come as the children fall and their mother is unconscious brad bird really knows how to reel us in
movies,not_removed,its a really great scene and sets the stakes for the rest of the movie surprisingly dark for a kids animated movie too
movies,not_removed,its crazy how much the film as aged it doesnt look bad by any means but man as a kid phew times have changed that being said this scene is still great holly hunter man kills it
movies,not_removed,india golf niner niner ive seen this movie so many times thats engrained in my head im so excited for the second movie
movies,not_removed,i feel the same everytime i watch that part of the movie its an incredible scene and the tension gets to me to the point that my eyes start watering as a matter of fact right now after watching it again they are
movies,not_removed,im still pissed off that were going to have cars movies before we get an incredibles
movies,not_removed,the only thing i didnt like as a kid was the lack of people or crowds running in the city in the last act they all disappear in a few minutes which makes sense they are protecting themselves i think disaster movies spoiled me
movies,not_removed,the way mr incredible acts throughout the rest of this movie after this is amazing all the different emotions that he goes through god i love this movie
movies,not_removed,what makes it so effective is the editing at around brad bird and team sure know how to keep you on the edge of your seat
movies,not_removed,question would a private jet or what appears to be a private jet be equipped with flares i know that she gets the plane from a military friend but are flares a standard feature on planes like this
movies,not_removed,looks like pixar does their research﻿
movies,not_removed,i loathe most animated movies but this one is just too good
movies,not_removed,this is my favorite scene of all time
movies,not_removed,really
movies,not_removed,i read that she spent time learning what the terms actually meant so that she could give weight where appropriate
movies,not_removed,imagine how incredible the sequel will look
movies,not_removed,the wethair physics are kind of shoddy and im almost sure there was clipping in elastigirls hair at the beginning of the movie
movies,not_removed,which if you arent aware is a reference to birds previous film iron giant released in
movies,not_removed,great movies dont need sequels
movies,not_removed,we got twilight and of its sequels we got shades grey and an upcoming sequel we got a transformers movie coming so cars isnt even the bottom of the barrel
movies,not_removed,and planes movies which came from the cars franchise
movies,not_removed,merchandising
movies,not_removed,cars is a cash cow
movies,not_removed,this is a world that about years ago was inhabited by superheroes and villians i can suspend my disbelief ebough that a plane like this would have one or two defensive capabilities as a result of those forces
movies,not_removed,i took it as if the old friend helped her in her superhero duties and had lots of gadgets and shit
movies,not_removed,no also not afterburners nor anywhere near that amount of maneuverability
movies,not_removed,are you one of those who always note that theres no sound in space whenever they watch star wars unless your question wasnt rhetorical in which case no they dont
movies,not_removed,interesting is there a particular reason you have such a strong reaction to animated movies im not asking as a way to try and change your mind im genuinely curious
movies,not_removed,really what
movies,not_removed,turn to the left
movies,not_removed,imagine how moleman will look
movies,not_removed,tony rydinger is related to syndrome and turns evil calling it now
movies,not_removed,the kinda stuff we will see fixed with the second film
movies,not_removed,incredibles is one of the only exceptions
movies,not_removed,i was just curious i dont think i noticed the flares or at least knew what they were supposed to be the last time i watched the movie
movies,not_removed,yes
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i am in a plane
movies,not_removed,imagine how moleman the underminer will look ftfy
movies,not_removed,isnt there an incredibles in the works
movies,not_removed,seriously there are tons of exceptions
movies,not_removed,turn to the right
movies,not_removed,yes i know that
movies,not_removed,there are trons of exceptions
movies,not_removed,when a character dies but not really because they were wearing a bullet proof vest or the poison they drank didnt kill them it only slowed their heart rate down to make them appear dead eg nick fury in the winter soldier wolverines wife in wolverine origins samuel l jacksons character in snakes on a plane sorry for using sam l jackson twice i dont mind if people survive sticky situations just please stop using only those examples get creative hollywood
movies,not_removed,cgi where they couldve used practical effects especially blood
movies,not_removed,when kids dont act like kids in movies
movies,not_removed,i can easily get into a movie no matter what if the dialogue is strong honestly i am in middle earth or fresno in rush hour with the characters involved if the screenplay is good if its not if the dialogue is poor or the motifs are noncongruent with the characters im done i just cant do it no matter the visuals or the acting and also people talking during a movie like guys you paid a tank of gas just to be here if you wanted to shoot the shit go the hell home
movies,not_removed,i agree with your military pet peeve why cant they just look online on how the collar is supposed to look just seconds on google
movies,not_removed,fake eyeglasses where they use flat pieces of glass instead of lenses the light reflects off them the wrong way and it just doesnt look real
movies,not_removed,when i can tell someone is acting i can tell someone is acting when i dont believe their behavior that and of course absurd blockbuster action films with way too much cgi i mean i know theyre just movies but i want them to make me believe not patronize me
movies,not_removed,the people talking next to me
movies,not_removed,when people dont say goodbye on the telephone
movies,not_removed,i dont have specific knowledge or expertise on any given area so im usually oblivious to the technical shit a movie might get wrong but the older i get and the more movies i see the more i grow to loathe tropes and throwaway lines every time i hear some variation of you just dont get it do you i die inside when the bleeding hero is hiding above someone elevator usually and im supposed to care about whether or not a drop of blood finds its way to the villains shoe im thinking ugh fuck this maybe it doesnt ruin the movie but it certainly taints it
movies,not_removed,i hate it when the fourth wall is broken personally with the exception of a narrator but as far as military and stuff goes they have gotten better with reloading
movies,not_removed,this doesnt necessarily ruin a film but it takes me out a bit when a film set in the has new cars in the background
movies,not_removed,its all a dream and inanimate objects trying to kill each other
movies,not_removed,people fucking talking
movies,not_removed,i can forgive most issues with movies and shows besides characters acting out of character or characters having crappy motivations for their actions
movies,not_removed,when there is a really simple solution that no one think of or attempts so the drama can continue also when characters are running out of time but stop to have a chat about how little time thy have
movies,not_removed,bad accents particularly when americans attempt a really bad british accent or british people do that terrible midatlantic thing
movies,not_removed,when movies try to trick you into thinking a main character is dead when they obviously arent it happens so much and it just pisses me off
movies,not_removed,peoples make noises or make any noticeable movements in cinema it distract my focus
movies,not_removed,if jesse eisenberg or kristen stewart are in the cast they are absolute charisma vacuums
movies,not_removed,spoilers if i see another film that goes with the killer is me or it was all a dream bull shit i will lose my mind id be fine with it if it was clever but it rarely is fight club cool secret window garbage the machinist garbage if that shit is too heavy handed it sucks figure it out in mins rots the plot
movies,not_removed,dont let autism keep you down bro
movies,not_removed,thats why unless i see a confirmed kill like a decapitation or a bullet in the head i tend to expect them to show up later also dramatic last words can substitute for the confirmed kill
movies,not_removed,the thing
movies,not_removed,i hate this one of the most annoying things imo i immediately lose interest
movies,not_removed,or just hire ex servicemen as extras
movies,not_removed,yeah i agree with the first part i can always tell bad acting if they seem like they are constantly lying as a good character
movies,not_removed,what about deadpool
movies,not_removed,eisenberg has been in some truly great movies
movies,not_removed,do you english
movies,not_removed,great comment you seem interesting want to meet up at the gathering this year
movies,not_removed,not a fan
movies,not_removed,no
movies,not_removed,thanks what did you find the most interesting about it ill be wearing a maga hat and open carrying at the meetup
movies,not_removed,umyes he has
movies,not_removed,lip it 😂 watched it days back
movies,not_removed,my wife always says this because of the movie hilarious
movies,not_removed,for a film so beloved ive never understood why more directors dont break conversational rules like in tokyo story ozu was a genius when it came to camera angles and breaking the reverse shot was spectacular his use of deep space and the for visual storytelling is bar none one of the greatest directors the walk the earth produced so many spectacular films but yet i never see people emulate his style as much as a kubrick or a fellini hell the only director who i think really took ozu to heart was kubrick love this list but its crazy to me looking at which directors were left off no renoir goddard truffaut bresson bergman antonioni kurosawa lang wiene fassbinder de palma herzog when you narrow it down to the best its just amazing how many prolific directors can be left off and still produce an astonishing list
movies,not_removed,if anyones interested heres the full top
movies,not_removed,tokyo story votes a space odyssey votes citizen kane votes votes taxi driver votes apocalypse now votes the godfather votes vertigo votes mirror votes bicycle thieves votes
movies,not_removed,francis ford coppola with films in the top ten best movies of all time voted by his peers that must feel so good
movies,not_removed,no sign of pulp fiction or a nolan film rmovies isnt going to like this one
movies,not_removed,im surprised no one has offered their own top ten in order to prove these directors wrong
movies,not_removed,the almao drafthouse by me is showing vertigo tonight i cant wait
movies,not_removed,if you guys are looking for a similar list of more recent films the site they shoot pictures dont they has a centurys most acclaimed films list here this still skips the and but frankly i cant think of a whole lot of films from that time period that stand up to ops list or the centurys list coincidentally the was the time that the summer blockbuster came around with jaws star wars etc it looks to be the time that studios saw that you didnt need to pour a lot of traditional filmmaking think hitchcock welles into a film in order to make money off it though jaws and star wars do have the and spots on the so thats interesting too
movies,not_removed,citizen kane should be on top and imo they picked the wrong ozu and tarkovsky movies my top list is better citizen kane an inn in tokyo ozu satantango godfather ii sancho the bailiff city lights seven chances andre rubelov tarkovsky the apu trilogy the shop around the corner
movies,not_removed,deleted
movies,not_removed,glad to see several movies on here that i havent seen yet and even a couple ive never heard of
movies,not_removed,i think the directors list is so much better than the critics one that is an absolutely gorgeous top
movies,not_removed,i would like to see a writers ranking
movies,not_removed,glad to see my favorite movie of alltime for over years now finally made it to the top spot
movies,not_removed,never really did anything for me not sure why maybe i just couldnt connect love bicycle thiefs though absolutely amazing movie
movies,not_removed,mirrors my favorite movie from this list what a
movies,not_removed,lustful sweaty gluttonous you have a way with words mr del toro
movies,not_removed,is there way to see the indiviual picks of the directors
movies,not_removed,nice i definitely prefer this list to the afi one
movies,not_removed,tokyo story and have been on my watchlist for years now gotta get round to watching them
movies,not_removed,makes sense all great movies and old movies interesting thing will be or years from now when theres a new crop of directors who may have favorites from this era will some century movies be higher than the godfather idk much about recent classics but will those be top i believe so tbh not taking anything away from these movies but many people today only like them because they are supposed to myself included as time goes on the film you are supposed to like shift too cant wait
movies,not_removed,the newest film was released years before i was born
movies,not_removed,this is their other top list of all time as chosen by critics and other academics definitely interesting to compare
movies,not_removed,is there a reason this list is mostly populated with old movies i see two from the and only from the is there an argument that old movies are inherently better or that movies need to sit awhile before they can be added to the list just want to make sure i am not sounding snarky genuinely curious if anyone knows
movies,not_removed,movie buffs and directors overrate older movies because of them being first to do things if the list was most innovative i could agree but i think writingactingcinematography has improved drastically over the last years and people put far too little value in it
movies,not_removed,vertigo is certainly not hitchcocks best film psycho is more influential the steps and north by northwest are a lot more fun rebecca and strangers on a train more dramatic
movies,not_removed,its like the music critics who say all the best songs came from the and
movies,not_removed,aaaaand i havent seen any of them
movies,not_removed,and what the fuck do they know
movies,not_removed,old movies are better and people know anything about movies agree
movies,not_removed,i guess all the best movies in history were made during the and whatever
movies,not_removed,and thats why i dont care what movies directors like
movies,not_removed,this comments section is so pretentious
movies,not_removed,i only like movies on this list seems like they really like old movies bw movies and really slow movies not a fan really though i must admit my top list also has godfather in it
movies,not_removed,yea i can see that
movies,not_removed,im disappointed that this is such a generic list
movies,not_removed,typical crap list so sick of seeing citizen kane on this list its like whats the best song ever and people say stairway to heaven
movies,not_removed,bicycle thief singular
movies,not_removed,random thoughts tokyo story is almost quaint if you watch it now the grandparents would have heart attacks if you could somehow pull them from the film show them what the equivalent generation of adults are like now i understand why is on there but i really got the impression watching it that only fellow directors could ever really understand it having said that ive only seen it once so maybe im off on that vertigo is straightup cheesy now particularly the ending which is undeniably comical i get that hitchcock paved the way for the thrillers and horror films we have today but looking back on them now theyre ironically neither thrilling nor scary with the possible exception of the birds ive never even heard of mirror
movies,not_removed,why all before seems a tad pretentious
movies,not_removed,bicycle thieves is a crappy movie the rest are good or excellent
movies,not_removed,pure nostalgia picks
movies,not_removed,they all suck except for the godfather and vertigo
movies,not_removed,obnoxious directors always choosing asian movies as a pinnacle of creation i completely despise most of the asian movie industry i just cant see past their pretentiousness have some more respect for yourself na and europe and yeah where are some of the latin america classics
movies,not_removed,kitano majidi and wes anderson were certainly inspired by ozu
movies,not_removed,if you look at the top godard is just bergman and truffaut theres so many talents in cinema history a top just doesnt do it justice
movies,not_removed,ozu was a genius when it came to camera angles and breaking the reverse shot was spectacular his use of deep space and the for visual storytelling is bar none are there any examples of this i have never even heard of this film but now im intrigued
movies,not_removed,i think ozu is the kind of artist who inspires people to be artists but his art was so singular that youd think well i cant create art like that whereas fellinis style seems much moreattainableif that makes sense only thing i disagree with is what de palma movie would come close to making this list i dont think he even cracked the top whats his best film blowout deer hunter barely even made the list i dont think he belongs in the conversation with those you listed hes on my most overrated filmmakers list theres a new doc out about him maybe i should check it out to try to figure out why hes so celebrated
movies,not_removed,ive seen most classic movies and tokyo story is one that i just hated i thought it was just painfully boring and im not the kind of person who can only sit through a film if theres constant explosions can you explain to me a little about why its so revered ill probably watch it again someday and would love to look at it from a different perspective
movies,not_removed,actually tokyo story isnt really breaking the rules the movie is more of a summit after years of shooting in a country that is not the united states earlier works from ozu are witnessing the same characteristics and deserved to be watched if ppl are interested in a way of shooting stories that is not from hollywood
movies,not_removed,whats wrong with the numbers
movies,not_removed,notice theres no shawshank redemption thats because the list was made by people who actually know what they are talking about take notes ledditors
movies,not_removed,im years old and none of the top films were released during my lifetime ive never even heard of most of them i think when ranking films they should be divided into ages or periods
movies,not_removed,wtf why is salo in the list isnt that one of the most disgusting movies of all time
movies,not_removed,the last years of filmmaking sucked apparently
movies,not_removed,but how could people forget the film classic jack
movies,not_removed,he could have had or at a stretch such a legendary director
movies,not_removed,godfather ii and the conversation are both nearly as good as the two that made the list its a shame the conversation isnt better known today a great creepy film nothing else quite like it overshadowed by the films that ffc made immediately before and after it
movies,not_removed,coppola is the undisputed master of either hitting it out of the park or fucking it up irredeemably the man has only the middle ground of godfather
movies,not_removed,i love quentins films much more than any of these but i still completely respect this list theyre the kind of films that can be seen as objectively the best of all time your own personal tastes dont have to be that way
movies,not_removed,guessing all the directors were on the older side and had their fav films picked out long before tarantino or nolan were operating
movies,not_removed,why do people like pulp fiction its like calling nirvana the best band of all time i get the significance and the cult status but one of the best or the best movie ever
movies,not_removed,the dark knight interstellar the prestige inception memento the dark knight rises mad max fury road nightcrawler john wick ex machina honorable mentions dredd pulp fiction tuck and dale vs evil the first minutes of up whiplash the mcu as a conglomeration suicide squad placeholder and of course memepool
movies,not_removed,to be honest i only have three films from on my top ten satantango shoah and do the right thing do the right thing is a common choice for both voters and film buffs the other two are more for the obsessive critics though id advise people who dislike long runtimes to just watch the longer films in parts
movies,not_removed,that rarely happens in these kind of threads usually there is just a lot of complaining about old movie bias without any substantive counter argument
movies,not_removed,a woman under the influence largent je taime je taime the tree of life sunrise double indemnity breaking the waves mullholland drive rear window i was born but and thats with arbitrary constraints of no more than one from the same decade or director although i generally agree with the ss top ten it is a bit predictable
movies,not_removed,mirror posession killer of sheep m the cranes are flying double indemnity the werkmeister harmonies paths of glory the passion of joan of arc the thin man
movies,not_removed,vertigo is supposed to be incredible on the big screen
movies,not_removed,i do like that list but its a really strange compilation of polls from the until now which could make it very difficult for modern films to break the list unlike with sight and sound its not a bad list but the spontaneity of sight and sounds director and critic polls i prefer tspdt does go on for films though which is really cool
movies,not_removed,there are many films that get a lot of respect from film academics critics directors etc just to name a handful blue velvet raging bull raiders of the lost ark fanny amp alexander a city of sadness fitzcarraldo once upon a time in america love streams blow out videodrome berlin alexanderplatz jaws was fyi
movies,not_removed,the bfi doesnt allow a series of movies to be voted as a single movie anymore theyve acknowledged that the apu trilogy would appear near the top of the list as well as kieslowski no choosing between movies in the dekalog or three colors trilogy nbsp i like that you have city lights above modern times as i feel the same way and thought it should have appeared further up
movies,not_removed,this is the main reason i like lists like these
movies,not_removed,isnt this kind of a typical lists i always sees these movies in top by critic producers or directors choice
movies,not_removed,all that jazz is like but with broadway theater its a masterpiece in my opinion no other film quite like it well except for of course and has a place in my top favorite films of all time
movies,not_removed,im actually not a bicycle thieves fan havent seen which is httpletterboxdcomobligatorylistlistofshame
movies,not_removed,watch it again i remember watching vertigo and not really liking it beyond the opening rooftop chase then i saw it again and i actually enjoyed itat least a year gap planning on seeing it again within the next years
movies,not_removed,i hated the first time i saw it hated hated hated but i liked the soundtrack and the ending was kinda fun so i watched it again and i started to understand what the movie was about and then i had to watch it again and i enjoyed it by the fourth viewing i thought it was a masterpiece it has to grow on you
movies,not_removed,watch it again in a couple years it took me a while to get it too but now i consider it a masterpiece
movies,not_removed,rewatch it until you love it or dont itll still be one of the best films ever made
movies,not_removed,for me the movie was like watching fellini jack himself off while screaming im such a good director look at me honestly i couldnt stand the movie i mean i can understand why other people like it especially other film makers but i just cant get into it at all
movies,not_removed,it sits with only mirror on that list with the feeling of an art movie i am with you in that it has never done anything for me too selfconscious and deliberately obscure and this is from someone whos favorite movie is last year at marienbad
movies,not_removed,its funny i love tarkovsky and think one of his films should be in the top ten but for whatever reason mirror doesnt do it for me
movies,not_removed,the afi list is godawful youd think itd be easier to make a best american films list since youre narrowing your choices but afis list cares more about reputation than anything the jazz singer was on the list at one point the first sound film ever made its not even that good
movies,not_removed,tokyo story is joyous and funny and charming all the way through it has a plot and characters and you care about about what happens is a selfconscious rather limited comment on the life of the director and the nature of film it is difficult to understand inward looking and has dated badly
movies,not_removed,i find it way to pretentious its like paul thomas anderson times but its great if you love style in movies and a lot of really lose talk and no clear story or storyline
movies,not_removed,will some century movies be higher than the godfather in the mood for love beau travail there will be blood satantango closeup the tree of life melancholia uncle boonmee the turin horse and walle all made the sight and sound top critic poll list so any one of those can certainly surpass the godfather hell in the mood for love is only a few spots away
movies,not_removed,i think there will be blood can go a lot higher on the list in next yearscurrently at
movies,not_removed,youre years old
movies,not_removed,old movies have shown that they can stand the test of time the classics are classics for a reason they were great years ago and they are still great today a new movie has only shown that it is great today but not that it will be great in years i cant say exactly why individual directors picked certain movies but some will value the influence that a movie has had on the movies that came afterwards that is partially why citizen kane is so well regarded because it changed how films are made for a movie to be influential it needs to have a lot of movies coming after it which are imitating it so it needs to be older for that to happen others will value movies that were formative for their own style and tastes in movies often some that they have watched in their teens since many of these directors are not exactly straight out of film school the movies that were formative for them are often older so there are several compound reasons why the list is mostly populated by older movies
movies,not_removed,i think influence takes years if not decades to fully appreciate i do wonder what the imdb top would look like if people were restricted from voting on a movie until a year after release
movies,not_removed,most of the directors they askedpolled were probably older and picked movies from their youthearly career its unlikely that a director like spielberg or cameron is going to pick a movie from the last years as his best of all time im sure if you adjusted the average age of director to somewhere in the mid you would get movies like jurassic park shawshank silence of the lambs etc be a lot higher on the list
movies,not_removed,i agree i think people who know about hitchcocks complicated personality and hangups and behavior towards women mix all that up into the film and end up thinking it has a lot more substance then it does ie a great film should be able to stand on its own without knowing anything about the filmmaker like you i think psycho is hitchcocks true masterpiece and had an immense historical influence of the portrayal of violence in film
movies,not_removed,watch them right now all of them
movies,not_removed,more than us theyve seen a lot of movies and made a lot of movies
movies,not_removed,feeling a bit inadequate eh well they make movies which means they know more than you
movies,not_removed,i love me some old movies but i disagree with you there simply because modern films have brought us some incredible achievements and with the easier access to filmmaking technology and free websites to host films on it may not be the best time for film so far but it may be the most adventurous and easiest which is certainly important
movies,not_removed,watch it with roger eberts audio commentarydoes a phenomenal job of illuminating why its so widely regarded as the bestmost influential film ever
movies,not_removed,its hard for some modern audiences to understand how revelatory the film was as you did not live the context of hollywood cinema in that era
movies,not_removed,learn about the technical side of cinema and the complexity in which its narrative unfolds it is a masterpiece
movies,not_removed,well first of all its spelled kane i think you watched something else
movies,not_removed,those just happen to be the easiest to agree on as the best its not like the films lower on the top are worse they just either have less agreement or arent as popular also the and were some of the greatest decades for film and it would be hard to get away with stuff like the japanese work of the or the french new wave of the nowadays with added studio restrictions thanks heavens gate my favorite film was made in the so i have reason to be angry but despite not being a huge fan of either bicycle thieves or apocalypse now i think its a great list maybe more modernity would be appropriate but we havent exactly agreed to which modern films are the best aside from a few exceptions in the mood for love beau travail satantango closeup the tree of life melancholia uncle boonmee the turin horse and walle all made the sight and sound top poll as voted by critics
movies,not_removed,well those movies inspire those directors to make your favorite films
movies,not_removed,bear in mind these are directors of a certain age who will have had their creative lives defined in certain years when these movies will have been popular younger directors would not pick these
movies,not_removed,we shouldnt be trusting those who have seen more films than us because theyre educated on the subject i get it some film school people are dicks but the people who voted arent just professors theyre active professionals who have seen thousands of films from many different countries what makes your opinion so much more worthy than theirs
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,have you seen all the movies they mentioned
movies,not_removed,i think its just that the truly great movies are justified in making those lists over and over again
movies,not_removed,you must be a nickleback fan
movies,not_removed,proper title is plural
movies,not_removed,have you even seen the movie there are thieves in the movie not only one
movies,not_removed,ladri di biciclette its been called both bicycle thieves and the bicycle thief in the us but the original title is in plural form
movies,not_removed,thats funny because the title being plural is actually pretty important to the meaning of the film when it was released as the bicycle thief they completely missed the point that the film is not about a single thief but a postwar culture full of thieves
movies,not_removed,your point about vertigo relies on it being on the list simply for being thrilling and scary
movies,not_removed,it takes time for films to build up best of alltime acclaim theres simply less consensus on what the best films of the and are and how high they should place though in the mood for love placed pretty high in the poll it has nothing to do with pretentniousness its a natural tendency to go with what is official acceptable to see as best of all time material and keep in mind that its a collective phenomenon im sure guillermo del toro had some recent film on there it just wasnt the same on that nuri bilge ceylan did probably
movies,not_removed,youre going to have to explain how a period of time can be pretentious
movies,not_removed,there were more movies made before than there were after its completely reasonable that an alltime greatest list will feature more movies made before that period than after it theres also the matter of filmmaking becoming increasingly commercialized somewhere around the time of jaws and star wars meaning theres a lot more crap being made now than in the past its incredibly silly and myopic to think the best films ever were made in your life time just because you happened to be around
movies,not_removed,classic bias lol
movies,not_removed,i mean come on no one cares about or bicycle thieves anymore outside film school im not a bicycle thieves fan either but theres a reason these people are experts and we arent theyve seen more films than well ever see in our lives saying no one cares about these films is ignorant of all the work and passion these people have and the problem with modern films is most directors probably had two or three on their list but since we havent universally decided what modern films are the best the voters probably just threw their favorites on their list and hoped others would agree citizen kane was a safe choice and you know itll make the list but something from the past few years is entirely unpredictable because other voters might decide on other modern films instead it takes a while for films to enter film canon so the only times modern films make the list right away is when theyre monumentally amazing the sight and sound top critic poll featured the likes of n the mood for love beau travail there will be blood satantango closeup the tree of life melancholia uncle boonmee the turin horse and walle and this poll was conducted in
movies,not_removed,youre obviously not cultured enough to get it
movies,not_removed,ive always thought of kitano and majidi but never considered wes how right you are
movies,not_removed,theres a top ohhhhh buddy thank u
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,it just means that in an interview or when two people are sitting across a table the camera stays on the same side of the table so one person is shot over the others left shoulder and the other person is shot over the firsts right shoulder if the camera was over the right shoulder on both sides it is considered to be confusing to the visitor
movies,not_removed,blow out is actually a film by antonioni arguably his best i dont count de palmas remake its actually pretty good but not my cup of tea his best would be scarface imo watch that documentary maybe listen to scorsese or tarantino talk about him scarface actually widely impacted the trajectory of cinema and both of those directors have gone on record saying that if taxi driver didnt exist we would put scarface in the same regard
movies,not_removed,it breaks the rule of the and uses the tatami shot id consider all of ozus work to break film convention hollywood isnt the only group that uses the
movies,not_removed,pmmeurur is right you might not see it as breaking the rules exactly but his techniques definitely went against convention ozu was definitely aware of sightline rules and the degree rule and he was aware of how much lower he kept his camera his peers have offered stories about how ozu explained and justified his style and that he thought his way of shooting worked just as well most of ozus contemporaries stuck more closely to what would be considered conventional blocking and editing even the masters who revolutionized other aspects of filming and broke convention in other ways
movies,not_removed,i understand that did you read my comment
movies,not_removed,some of them are equally placed eg joint place so they dont put place in
movies,not_removed,your name is very apt
movies,not_removed,that says more about you than the list maybe try learning more about film and broadening your horizons by watching more movies
movies,not_removed,eh cant really do that most of the great things we have in movies today were done first in these old movies
movies,not_removed,just because you havent heard of these films or they werent released in your lifetime doesnt mean they arent the goat im sure these accomplished filmmakers know a little bit more about cinema and its history than most people
movies,not_removed,a movie can be both disgusting and great
movies,not_removed,yes i watched it from start to finish and felt that it had nothing to offer its just some italian elites during wwii kidnapping a throng of teenagers and sexually abusing them in horrifying ways from what i remember i was neither entertained nor edified
movies,not_removed,or that it takes a long time for a work to be hailed as an alltime masterpiece its going to take a while for a universal consensus to emerge
movies,not_removed,well firstly the concept of the auteur kind of died out after heavens gate with no studio daring to give a director full control of a project secondly it takes a long time to see if a film grows dated or not so when choosing between equally good films you may go with the older one because its remained just as good despite being aged finally when films are recent its hard for critics and filmmakers decide a canon for new films sure you have the occasional in the mood for love beau travail etc but voting for a modern film is dangerous in polls like this as its much more likely there will be hundreds of films with one vote rather than one universal modern film everyone can agree on again in the mood for love took that role but until a universal canon is decided well have to wait and see which modern films left the most impact
movies,not_removed,you could make the argument if a work is truly going to deserve be in the canon of all time greats it should at least be able to stand the test of time first
movies,not_removed,weve been making films for years every year a few of them are excellent and most are forgettable if excellent films accrue at a rate of a few per year most of them were made in the past it isnt that old films are good just that good films are likely to be old plus a few more added each year
movies,not_removed,just old people romanticizing their time
movies,not_removed,i really enjoyed that film robin williams made that film anyone else might have made it shit though
movies,not_removed,how could you forget about the masterpiece that was twixt
movies,not_removed,but god damn he managed to make all of these in one decade thats impressive
movies,not_removed,yeah its almost weird how hes still alive making movies but theres really no reason to tune in
movies,not_removed,theyre the kind of films that can be seen as objectively the best of all time the best of all time isnt an objective category though so no you cant you realize that right
movies,not_removed,to be honest i really cant think of a film from either of them that could contend with these guys
movies,not_removed,most dont direct their first feature films until theyre in their at the earliest and have their favorite films picked out long before becoming active filmmakers i doubt there was anything newer than the getting more than a couple of votes that said id be hard pressed to swap out any of the titles mentioned here for anything tarantino or nolan has made as good as they may be stellar list this
movies,not_removed,really you think that these directors just decided on their favorites decades ago and closed their minds thereafter thats the most plausible reason that this list doesnt include the dark knight
movies,not_removed,people love pulp fiction because its an incredible film cult status has to do with that it is what it is you watch it and its judged on what you see and hear in that hrs not anything else and its my favorite movie so it is the best movie ever you do realize that favorite movie or song is a subjective choice dont you when you poll many people it becomes collectively subjective but still basically the same
movies,not_removed,i dont think you really understand the meaning of cult status pulp fiction made at the box office in money and was nominated for and won tons of awards nirvana was the biggest band in the world for years and sold records they arent cult art they are wildly successful and have stayed popular until now because of their lasting quality both of them changed their mediums music and movies wouldnt be the same today without them but they werent just significant or good for their time they were the best of their time
movies,not_removed,if this is a joke its pretty funny if this isnt a joke its pretty funny
movies,not_removed,httpiimgurcomkkehahxgif
movies,not_removed,i understand youre trying to being facetious and it worked i laughed
movies,not_removed,how dare you leave out moon
movies,not_removed,udanicalifornication would be proud rip
movies,not_removed,this is gold
movies,not_removed,im dead inside now thank you
movies,not_removed,the dark knight rises the dark knight rises the dark knight rises the dark knight rises the dark knight rises the dark knight rises the dark knight rises the dark knight rises the dark knight rises fight club
movies,not_removed,man from uncle
movies,not_removed,you really must be kidding there are a couple good movies on that list not one worth dwelling on years later that said the directors list was awful too
movies,not_removed,any chance you would be interested in sharing your top
movies,not_removed,i watched tarrs the turin horse and im not sure if i could endure another of his films tbh
movies,not_removed,really the fact that someone existed before someone else so they got to use a technique first makes their incredibly boring and shit movie eternally beloved cause that dude was simply born earlier these lists are objectively bad because its a bunch of directors circlerjerking each other about real cinema not the garbage they make today its a joke it was always the same garbage it was just more boring back in black and white
movies,not_removed,i agree it is predictable and the lack of modern movies nothing beyond the in the top ten is laughable
movies,not_removed,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz except
movies,not_removed,he even has an extended list somewhere on that site that goes on for nearly films the guy is dedicated to say the least but i agree with the sentiment on sight sound i like their poll that is taken every years makes the films that make it onto those lists seem even more important
movies,not_removed,i like that its not as america centric as a lot of lists are
movies,not_removed,the bfi doesnt allow a series of movies to be voted as a single movie anymore i knew i was possibly cheating but i have seen a screening of all the apu trilogy films all projected in one showing with intermissions and it works best that way
movies,not_removed,modern times is great too but just like city lights better and that final close up of charlie is just so amazing one of the most beautiful pieces of acting in a single shot in film history i had singin in the rain on my list too but then it got knocked off by andre rubelov
movies,not_removed,i assume they are talking about
movies,not_removed,not watching a masterpiece is your loss
movies,not_removed,if directors saying it is the best movie ever isnt enough to convince you than i dont know what will
movies,not_removed,oh boy ive only seen of these quite a few films on here that are on my own list of shame id suggest watching rashomon next by the way my favorite kurosawa just in front of seven samurai and ran
movies,not_removed,at uni yup film class i had to hide i didnt see space odyssey and i am huuge scifi fan i dont know why i think i am waiting to see it in cinema as i feel my humble laptop screen wont be able to contain it not bicycle thieves fan either umberto d is more my style
movies,not_removed,or maybe its not for everyone just because a film is great and i do love doesnt mean everyone absolutely has to love it fellini is a pretty divisive director and its not hard to see how could be hard to connect to as it seems so navelgazing on the surface
movies,not_removed,vertigo was difficult for me i liked the story arc but there are so many scenes of him tailing her where it seems like he is the only one around in car or on foot it seems so obvious that hes following her that it became difficult for me to accept that she was unaware of it or that he would believe she was unaware
movies,not_removed,definitely a movie that benefits a rewatch
movies,not_removed,the first time i watched it was in history of film class in high school it didnt do anything for me then when i got to college and discovered the criterion collectionwhich i adore i decided to try it out at again thinking that since i was more mature both in age and movie understanding again it did nothing for me not every great andor classic film is beloved by everyone thats just not ever going to happen it doesnt mean i dont get the movie or it went over my head or anything it just never affected me in anyway
movies,not_removed,this is how i felt about inherent vice
movies,not_removed,really good art is complex and requires the viewer to be altered by their exposure to it
movies,not_removed,im right there with you too mirror is my least favorite and the only one of his movies that didnt have a strong effect on me then again both sacrifice and nostalghia took me a second watch before they really hit me so this could be the same case stalker would be my favorite
movies,not_removed,and not even really sound to be fair a few songs and some ad libs but otherwise told through the same grammar and structure as generic american silent fare of the time
movies,not_removed,tokyo story is joyous and funny and charming all the way through i love this movie but
movies,not_removed,nothing about has dated badly fantastic timeless film still as beautiful as ever to look at
movies,not_removed,dated that is insane
movies,not_removed,just because something isnt what youre used to doesnt make it pretentious calling federico fellini pretentious is just completely ridiculous
movies,not_removed,that makes a lot of sense directors are probably going to be more influenced by the predecessors than their peers thanks for the reply
movies,not_removed,atleast a few years
movies,not_removed,you would get movies like jurassic park shawshank silence of the lambs etc be a lot higher on the list okay silence of the lambs and shawshank maybe but these votes are done by choosing your ten favorite films and no disrespect to jurassic park its a wonderful movie but not many critics or directors would honestly put it in their top ten over the top ten listed by op these people have seen thousands of films from dozens of countries and styles theyll often pick the most ambitious powerful heartwrenching films that left more impact than the really well made blockbuster
movies,not_removed,there will be recent movie on the listits quite safe a lot of those old directors picked it for their one of the best of all time
movies,not_removed,i think one reason for vertigos hallowed status was the fact that it was out of circulation for years so was able to build up a mythos but i think stewart is possibly miscast he usually plays down to earth guys not really the types whod have a monomania over a woman never mind ones whod be afraid of heights
movies,not_removed,vertigo is one of the richest deepest films ive ever seen and a great example of just how much it is possible to convey through purely visual cinematic means
movies,not_removed,but i am at work d
movies,not_removed,it was supposed to be a joke
movies,not_removed,thats my thought on kane it was technically groundbreaking in its day i dont think it has aged well though along the same lines i saw when it came out and thought it was really cool rewatched it a few years back and the wormhole sequence came across as mickeymouse graphics that go on too long
movies,not_removed,well you got me there
movies,not_removed,tokyo story was never popular in america the voters who chose these films likely did so because these films are both strikingly original sometimes groundbreaking approaches to cinematic form and because theyre still engaging films obviously youre free to dislike these films but a lot of filmgoers carry a certain obstinacyresistance to films not made in a more modern style as though all art must reach them with as little give and take as possible ie yes the bicycle thief is bw and italian but give the flick room adjust to its rhythms and stakes and it will crush your heart with its simple unfiltered drama
movies,not_removed,i have a hard time believing that young directors would not pick these movies all of them are huge parts of film history regardless of your age someone who aspires to be a director would certainly study film history and is just as likely to conclude that these movies have earned their place
movies,not_removed,good point it is also possibly mostly white old men from usa
movies,not_removed,no but nicklebacks a fan of me
movies,not_removed,yes i know the story never in all my life have i seen it pluralized though thats like if one day you woke up and saw albert camus famous book the strangers or who can forget jack kerouacs immortal on the roads were on listicles
movies,not_removed,im sure guillermo del toro had some recent film on there it just wasnt the same on that nuri bilge ceylan did probably actually not here is and here is im not writing this to point out that you were wrong but to point to the fact that we can actually access all the individual lists it would be very interesting to collect this data and check the distribution of production years among all the films that received votes but i completely agree with you it is only natural that works need time before we can pass judgement on them in particular it is impossible to say how influential a film will be until a couple of decades have passed
movies,not_removed,nah just keep spam downvoting fuck having opinions
movies,not_removed,its fortunate then i dont think that then
movies,not_removed,biased towards masterpieces
movies,not_removed,maybe it would go down easier for me if id seen it in the time it was released but scarface has aged really poorly in my opinion something like taxi driver is equally of the time id say but doesnt feel bogged down by being in its time period scarfaces synth montages stick out like a sore thumb and are just the tip of the iceberg for me the performances the pacing and script theres just a lot of issues i have with the film i think im going to go catch the doc this weekend because its always baffled me how much praise he gets when i cant even enjoy the direction in just about any of his films that ive seen besides blow out i really like the plots or the writing or the performances in a lot of his films but ive always found them to not work for me on the whole i wonder what it is that im not seeing
movies,not_removed,blowup is the antonioni and its among his best and blow out is the de palma blow out is a reimagining of blowup but blowups story is based on a book so they are both reinterpretations i remember the difference because a blowup is a photo enlargement and a blow out is an audio term
movies,not_removed,ah ok that makes sense
movies,not_removed,just because it was done first doesnt mean it was best this is a list of best not firsts not saying the list is bad but your logic defending it is
movies,not_removed,if modern films arent even up for consideration its not a list of the alltime best its a list of the best from years ago
movies,not_removed,not just that but we have auteur films coming out regularly they just dont always get mentioned its interesting to see how ignored they are when there are a lot of good ones
movies,not_removed,a lot of our favorite movies today take influence from the films on this list these movies are all amazingly crafted pieces of art
movies,not_removed,im guessing youre one of those anything made before is boring types
movies,not_removed,yep patton the conversation gfii apocalypse now was it john cazales hot streak or ffcs
movies,not_removed,well they seem to be the most agreeable for directors the people that keep the medium going
movies,not_removed,of course not
movies,not_removed,personally i like qt and nolan films in general more than i do of the films on this list gasp however a vast number of the films on this list are considered some of the best of all time because of their impact on the industry and art of filmmaking so i understand why the directors polled would prefer these films over great films made after the mid i respect essentially all the films on the list as well for example i dont like citizen kane very much but i absolutely can see the masterful craftsmanship with which it was made
movies,not_removed,why not because its too recent so it cannot possibly be as good
movies,not_removed,pulp fiction the prestige the dark knight not that hard to think of a few
movies,not_removed,well isnt that kind of the problem with these kind of lists you cant think of any that can contend with their but then again isnt this often the case when critics form a list is very different these arent the critics but the average people who watch movies which results in a far different movie and that sort of highlights why these lists are only that relevant sure the critics pick out great movies in their mind the best but they are not equal to the of the rest of the population so is that list then so meaningful i beg to differ this can of course have to do that especially older movies arent as accessible as the more modern movies literally in actually to see them but also taste wise they arent up to date and thats where even those great movies fall short they are great on itself in their genre in their time span but when you consider what present day directors like tarantino or nolan bring you can wonder if they really arent that good to me the oscars in general reflect this very feeling strongly a ton of movies that receive them to me are ok but certainly not the best what that year had to offer but obviously the critics think differently they can but that doesnt make their list better i would actually say more the opposite their list is less great then what the average joe considers
movies,not_removed,i doubt there was anything newer than the getting more than a couple of votes if you look at the top list there are indeed several films made after the goodfellas in the mood for love hidden there will be blood mulholland dr beau travail edit fixed rankings
movies,not_removed,critics just stop watching films after deciding their favorites back in thats why their favorites dont consist entirely of films from the s
movies,not_removed,you took my comment the wrong way i wasnt defending tarantino or nolan its more likely these filmmakers will cherish the films that got them into filmmaking rather than the ones they saw after they entered the industry i think the films on this list are incredible and far more significant than anything those two have made
movies,not_removed,yeah but like with nirvana it has a lot of fantastic marketing and part of that marketing is making the product weird unique and special its like making a movie all in red colors to be unique and that movie becomes the best movie of all time
movies,not_removed,its a joke you can tell by the first five minutes of up and the use of the word conglomeration only pretentious film critics use that word
movies,not_removed,satantango jeanne dielman citizen kane mon oncle antoine do the right thing shoah pourquoi israel i am cuba reconstruction the magnificent ambersons
movies,not_removed,thats an awful film to start out with bud try damnation or werckmeister harmonies
movies,not_removed,it was just more boring back in black and white you know color film was a thing back in the silent era right
movies,not_removed,you cant comment on movies from the past man you werent around when they were black and white
movies,not_removed,we are very fortunate to have been born during a time when so many movies are at our fingertips and at a time when there is so much focus on film restoration i really hope that the new restorations of the apu trilogy will turn people on to rajs work
movies,not_removed,sold
movies,not_removed,to be fair only of them thought it was the best
movies,not_removed,is a gorgeous film the bluray does it a lot of justice but if you can see it in theaters i imagine itd be a trip i cant think of many films that would be better suited for a theater
movies,not_removed,often familiarity with certain styles and themes can make for a more enjoyable experience especially with older movies i think a second watch can change things a lot
movies,not_removed,well the film isnt meant to be realistic so the best way to come to terms with those scenes is to see it as a stylised way of keeping the scene clear for the audience
movies,not_removed,did you finish the movie because she was being paid to pretend she didnt know who he was or that he was following her
movies,not_removed,i gotta rewatch vertigo because i think its maybe the most overrated film of all time
movies,not_removed,exactly first time for me was yeah its great but there are other films second time watched it and finally understood why its an amazing movie
movies,not_removed,ahhh i see what you did there
movies,not_removed,the themes covered in are very tokyo storys more universal family themes dont date
movies,not_removed,which modern films is it comparable in style to
movies,not_removed,the person you replied to also said that pulp fiction and nirvana is edgy and does not deserve the claim they received so ill take their opinion with a grain of salt
movies,not_removed,it is pretentious i think he would fully agree with that himself pretentious movies is a real thing and he clearly does see himself as incredible
movies,not_removed,im a baby boomer who watched a lot of old movies when they were a staple of broadcast tv vertigo was a film that was regularly shown on tv it didnt really have that kind of mystique actually its psycho that was held back longer than other hitchcock films because of the for its time graphic violence stewart is possibly miscast hmm maybe he sure is not a loser type like hitchcock but the worst jimmy stewart miscasting of all time was him in the man who shot liberty valence where the part called for someone around years old and he was around it was absolutely ridiculous and too bad because i like the idea of the film quite a bit and wayne was perfectly cast
movies,not_removed,it doesnt show up so much on a tv but on a big screen the frequently used rear screen projection is shockingly badly done which in and of itself kind of takes me out of the movie to an extent also that stewarts character is doing things like picking out dresses for kim novak is too weird to go unremarked on i mean this character is supposed to be a former cop not a tailor the film asks the audience to take too much for granted but modern day scholarly types fill a lot of these glaring gaps in with knowledge about hitchcocks life in which case yes a film director is responsible for picking out wardrobes for all the characters dont get me wrong i think the story is a great idea but think hitchcock didnt completely do it justice and it could be better
movies,not_removed,your boss will understand
movies,not_removed,hmm you gotta work on your keyboard sarcasm guy it doesnt come off as a joke at all
movies,not_removed,kane is still a technical marvel as is how have they not aged well this is typically code for paced differently than films today
movies,not_removed,you are misunderstanding my meaning of popular i mean popularacceptedhip among cinephiles of the not popular among the general public during that time i dont need you to explain to me that some bw films are good im just explaining to the poster why the films on this list are all old the directors on the list are mainly old
movies,not_removed,well im a younger film fan and my top ten has films ranging from to with most of those falling around the and so i feel if youve seen enough movies age is irrelevant yet so many people in this thread feel the films are old because the voters are old
movies,not_removed,sure they would appreciate them and understand their impact on film history but would they think they are the best i dont think so
movies,not_removed,its not that these films are bad its that theres nothing here past thats crazy
movies,not_removed,if you have a movie about more than one bicycle thief its thieves not thief it makes sense
movies,not_removed,del toros list is actually very interesting i havent seen all but those that i am familiar with it is easy to see how they shaped del toros style as a filmmaker same can also be said for ceylan its not hard to see antnoini tarkovsky bresson ozu and bergman in his movies
movies,not_removed,well you still havent explained your opinion i didnt downvote you and you could have defended your opinion but complaining about downvotes is certainly easier than backing up your first statement
movies,not_removed,only reason i got into antonioni was because i had to watch blow up for a darkroom class since its based on film and enlarges lol
movies,not_removed,first better doesnt matter originality and creativity are why most of the movies on the list are on there in the first place give me some examples of modern movies who have borrowed from movies off of this list and vastly improved on them so much so that it could justify crediting them rather than their predecessors
movies,not_removed,where does it say they werent
movies,not_removed,oh god yes every movie made before is in a league of its own if you jerk their dicks any harder theyre gonna splooge all over you dude
movies,not_removed,is that statement really so much more ignorant than every film made after is terrible i think its a fair criticism and likely due to a sense of nostalgia amongst the critics surveyed
movies,not_removed,not even close
movies,not_removed,man i miss john cazale great actor
movies,not_removed,what does that have to do with it being objective or subjective its a matter of opinion that means its not objective
movies,not_removed,nah the closest that i could get is reservoir dogs in like my top lol
movies,not_removed,or theyre so recent we cant yet rate how influential they are a space odyssey set the bar very high for scifi films it was cerebral and beautiful and it took over a decade before anything like it was made every detail was superb and it has aged very well with time a good movie is a fine and fun thing but a great movie makes you keep thinking and wondering about it long after the credits have rolled
movies,not_removed,no while i would consider that factor for sure i dont think they have a single film that could hold a candle to this top especially when you consider the guys left off it tarantino i might put reservoir dogs around but still unsure nolan i think its one of the worlds more overrated directors but i do have to give my respect however i just dont think of a film of his that could make top let alone top recency bias against their films does play a factor though
movies,not_removed,hahaha holy shit no
movies,not_removed,the dark knight are you yo or just have the mental development of someone that age prestige is a fine movie but thats also a major stretch we are talking top of all time pulp fiction is my so i obviously think it is deserving
movies,not_removed,for serious cinephiles these lists both the critics and directors are far far more relevant than the imdb lists learning to appreciate filmmaking as an artform takes watching a lot of movies from every era of filmmaking in order to develop taste for those that are just starting to get into the art of filmmaking that are learning about history and context and aesthetics lists like these are invaluable they let you know which works of art the artists themselves love which the critics love and how they compare no list is infallible and you can argue with the merits of all of the movies on the list kieslowski and tarantino for example werent included but you need to have a welldeveloped appreciation of film in order to be able to argue for or against any of these movies nbsp imdb top lists should not be mistaken for an average of all users that rate movies on imdb imdbs rating system though it has never been fully detailed gives more weight to the votes of the most active users look at the top and youre looking at the top movies for men aged there are many articles about imdb ratings but av club has a good primer for one of the best articles that ive read about the ratings system imdb may be a good list to go to when youre looking for an entertaining movie and there are many great films on the top but its far from being the consensus for the average filmgoer and its even further from being a list curated by serious cinephiles
movies,not_removed,this is like shitting on michelin starred restaurants because you think personally you prefer bjs deep dish pizza more than anything else of course in the end you should eat what you want to the argument can also be made that critics are snobs but i feel like ive experienced both sides and can give my perspective i do agree that tokyo story is one of the greatest movies ive ever seen it changed how i think about things even in many ways even if youre gonna not notice all the awesome details about it this movie is good but watching a movie like tokyo story is work you cant watch it with friends over pizza this movie demands your full attention subtitles notwithstanding watching tokyo story cannot be a leisure activity for most common folk its hard it also looks old so for someone who just wants to come home and relax after a long day especially if theyre not super passionate about movies then that is not a movie you should be watching so the question really boils down to this are you just looking at movies as an alternative to watching keeping up with the kardashians then yes a regular joe movie is what you should watch and probably imdb recommendations are best for you but if you really want to understand what a movie can really be as an art form not just as entertainment you owe it to yourself to at least watch all these movies once before you can fully shit on them i mean if youve watched them and still want to shit on them please go ahead but do go ahead remembering that there is still a very important place for movies like these critics who like movies like these and lists like these
movies,not_removed,well i get that film us the working mans artform but taste cannot be up to date just because the average joe considers dark knight to be a top ten of all time doesnt mean it is i think the list points out the bias against more recent films as standing the test of time is a big factor in their elevated status back in the day the working man loved the cabinet of dr caligrlari if the same film released today itd be a film for the critics and artists but when it first came out the art lovers and upper class thought it was purely entertainment this means that the lens we view film through changes but differentiating films based on whether or not the taste of the mainstream is concurrent with the artist is a ridiculous notion again it is the working mans artform but thats not because i should favor the working man its because the working man can afford it
movies,not_removed,in the mood for love is such a hypnotic movie i love it surprised chungking express isnt on this list though
movies,not_removed,thats right both the directors list and the critics list have many contemporary movies there might be fewer of them comparatively because the movies have to span years of cinema i think that like others mentioned it often takes some time for a consensus to be formed about a film i would have included the master and code unknown instead of there will be blood and hidden for example
movies,not_removed,its just the romanticized effect the older a movie is the more people forget about its flaws and the more it shines it happens with basically everything
movies,not_removed,well i stand corrected not sure id put some of those choices ahead of say pulp fiction but understandable choices nonetheless
movies,not_removed,films out of aint much also goodfellas is the only one of those six that got a good number of votes so the person you replied to is kind of right
movies,not_removed,theres less than films of the last years though and they are located well outside the top you can argue over which films from the more recent years should have gotten votes but the bias towards older works is undeniably there and it is very strong the top list is also significantly distorted by the way the polling was conducted at least if they use the method that they use for their other lists making a top list out of top lists does not work the further down you go the less representative it gets that is underlined by the huge clusters of draws once you get outside the top that is indicative of them getting only a very low number of points which in turn means a single ballot can shift a movie upward ranks or could potentially even elevate a film not on the list into the top on its own in the most extreme case
movies,not_removed,thats pretty dissapointing that i drink your milkshake is on there why should i give a shit what any of these guys think clearly their pretentious asses like different movies than i do
movies,not_removed,and yep when i worked as critic i could easily give to many films i criticised but still my top ever is still very similar to this i watch many films from all over the world but i havent found some films that managed to infiltrate my top not yet because i really was influenced and amazed by films in my top its not because critics are pretentious its because they truly believe those film deserve to be there as they were ground breaking and innovative there is reason why ozu always end up in top because he deserves to be there when i saw tokyo story for a first time i was amazed by it and it also hit me emotionally for example same with andrei rublev yes its slow and hard to watch when you dont have patience but last minutes itself made me more thrilled than anything i saw in a long time and this also comes for a person who shat brick of fangirl happiness during cap america civil war owns collector copy of dark knight and lord of the rings makes her cry all the time but tokyo story yojimbo blow up the general and dr strangelove are still my top
movies,not_removed,nirvana has a bunch of really great songs and it was more than just marketing that catapulted them into super stardom they completely changed the landscape of mainstream music seemingly overnight that is a huge feat
movies,not_removed,restored lawrence of arabia in on a big screen too i was told and i missed it because i had to take a train home still feel bad about it my friend wouldnt shut up about how amazing it was for a really long time but i believe i will see one day its one of those film thats get screened on festivals so one day
movies,not_removed,duuuuuuuude you have no idea how right you are i thought it was a great movie that wasnt near his best until i saw it on very recently i nearly melted in my seat and was completely drawn in for the entire thing i never fully understood the emptiness and length of some of of the scenes until i was completely immersed in them the greatest theatregoing experience ive ever had
movies,not_removed,yeah i got that it just seemed weird that she wouldnt have to play it off a bit more or that he would have done a better job an earlier comment on this thread dealt with the film being stylized that works i suppose i prefer a more natural style
movies,not_removed,synechdoche new york the great beauty birdman and yeah it is about a film director but the story is more about trying to find happiness and working with ones flaws ideas that arent exclusive to directors not to mention the story itself will be relevant for as long as there are not only directors but artists and creative people or heck even just people that have a lot of shit going on in their life
movies,not_removed,what is he pretending to be exactly
movies,not_removed,well i certainly think there are some intentional parallels with what stewarts character does and the actions of a director but at the same time in the story scotty is clearly going insane and imposing his will on the girl in order to transform her into the image of the girl that he loves and of course to do that would require him to change her wardrobe and hair and makeup and what not
movies,not_removed,im sorry i triptrapped across your bridge sir please dont eat me wait for my big brother billy for he is much bigger and tastier than i
movies,not_removed,yet so many people in this thread feel the films are old because the voters are old seriously it doesnt really make logistical sense anyways its not like the directors who made the list all grew up at the same time and the movies in the top ten are pretty diverse in terms of decade
movies,not_removed,well it does depend on your definition of best of course but do you think its ridiculous that a young director could see taxi driver the godfather tokyo story etc and conclude that they are in fact some of the best movies of all time not everyones taste in movies is limited to their own generation besides theres a reason these movies are always on these lists new generations keep seeing them and concluding that they are some of the best movies ever made theres no secret or conspiracy here these are just really fucking good movies
movies,not_removed,the full list of has a few from the and i think its reasonable that the top wouldnt have anything that recent
movies,not_removed,well really it has to do with how the list is formed it appears that the directors made their lists and then the films that got the most mentions were put into the top ten the ten chosen here are pretty universally loved so its not surprised that they made many of the lists
movies,not_removed,i am not debating its grammaticality i am saying that the title that i knew for years is singular never until this list have i seen it pluralized others have noted that it is known by both names but the original us release was singular not plural that is the name that i knew the name that i was taught and to me it seems odd that there are two naming conventions seeming for no reason
movies,not_removed,like i said i am not debating grammaticality i am stating the fact that the original us release was not pluralized
movies,not_removed,certain people seem to treat appreciating older movies like some mark of cultural distinction they call feel snobby about appreciating black and white movies that a mainstream audience now might reject are you telling me all of those movies are better than goodfellas or the fellowship of the ring or alien not a chance
movies,not_removed,you just said it takes a long time for a movie to be hailed as a masterpiece that would remove all recent movies from consideration
movies,not_removed,dude my favorite movie is pulp fiction but in a lot of ways it cant compare to the bicycle thieves it didnt capture a time or a city as well as taxi driver it isnt as iconic as i love the smell of napalm in the morning did you know that ill make him an offer he cant refuse started in the godfather i used that for years before finding out it wasnt just a saying the godfather is a movie that holds up as well today as it did when it came out you think christoph waltz was great in inglourious basterds with expressing a ton of emotion in a barely moving face watch al pacino go from conciliatory to murderous in godfather and tell me who is better there are movies i personally didnt enjoy i do feel that citizen kane is somewhat dated i didnt enjoy or for that matter most of the kubrick filmography ive seen but i cant deny their vast influence on the art of filmmaking you look at someone like tarantino with the massive ego he clearly displays hell tell you hes nothing compared to some of these masters of the craft they inspired him to create the movies ones which i personally enjoy more even with that enjoyment not appreciating the brilliance of these films says to me that you havent seen them im not saying you will like all of them i dont but try to appreciate some
movies,not_removed,learn some cinema dude
movies,not_removed,is that statement really so much more ignorant than every film made after is terrible no so its a good thing no one has said that i think its a fair criticism and likely due to a sense of nostalgia amongst the critics surveyed no it isnt and the first part of your comment shows why inclusion of many older movies isnt a condemnation of newer ones its a reflection of the simple fact that older films have had more time to be evaluated and prove themselves we need time to see the impact of a film and develop a consensus if were discussing and praising a film years after it came out its shown it has something that stands the test of time there are in fact movies from after in the top maybe as time wears on they will move up movies that are years old are just too new to tel how they stand up
movies,not_removed,sorry before then
movies,not_removed,its a subjective list but its a highly researched subjective list by professionals that certainly doesnt make it objective but its the closest we can get to an objective list thats why we have a film canon a list of films that are most often agreed on as the best its like if you asked a large number of experts a question about their field of interest it may be a subjective question but the most popular answer is still worth something or importance
movies,not_removed,to start a very tired conversation my problem with was that after all the thinking and wondering i did after investigating the commentary on it what i came to was immensely disappointing it had some stunning visuals but it just didnt really add up to a whole lot people still talk about the visual experience but you never really hear them talking about the ideas and that was a letdown for me having been assured that it was a rich deep and complex film as a point of contrast mulholland drive got better and better the more i thought about it just sort of melted away
movies,not_removed,if a film has to be over years old just for consideration they shouldnt call it an alltime list its excluding decades
movies,not_removed,thats sort of a weak argument since pulp fiction is proven to be influential to film
movies,not_removed,what is up with mulholland drive being anything more than a shitty movie from the late ive been seeing its name pop up everywhere saw that movie years ago it was absolute trash
movies,not_removed,the only thing those other movies have on nolans films is age give it a few decades and the dark knight will be held in the same high regard as and citizen kane some of the films in that list werent considered that great in their time either—vertigo was considered one of hitchcocks lesser works and was dismissed as pretentious and incomprehensible
movies,not_removed,well said
movies,not_removed,in all fairness it still makes no difference for what art is in the end a personal taste and one personals taste isnt perse better then the other heck if you look at the from imdb you do see quite some overlap but at the same time also a couple of more recent movies when you start compiling a list of all sorts without understanding the mechanics it means very little how were the questions asked who were invited how were the questions send it all influences the results so no its not really comparing a star michelin restaurant with pizza hut and figure out pizzahut is better because its more popular imdb compiles a list based on popularity and rating which results in a certain ranking which is rather transparent still containing a ton of classics but also more present day movies like pulp fiction as well fight club
movies,not_removed,thank you for reminding me that i havent watched any of his films in a few years time for a marathon
movies,not_removed,chungking express is firmly in my top of all time but i can see why filmmakers would like in the mood for love better its a perfectly crafted film but it doesnt have faye wong
movies,not_removed,i bought the criterion collection bluray for in the mood and watched it a few days ago for the first time so gorgeous
movies,not_removed,its not that it takes time for a consensus it takes time for everyone to start circlejerking about a couple films for the next year until theyre all dead and we never have to hear about how fucking amazing it is because it was a sled the whole fucking time
movies,not_removed,nonsense the real bias is the one in favor of recency youll see people here lobbying for current familar films they like in lieu of deep catalog theyve never seen more people alive today have seen the matrix than safety last for example so keanu will beat harold in a poll
movies,not_removed,i dont think the age of a movie is closely related to how long ago you saw it for most people it certainly isnt for me so why would you be more likely to forget the flaws of older movies
movies,not_removed,ive actually collected all the individual vote data for another project not just to prove you wrong and it turns out that out of the votes cast in total in the directors poll directors selected films each were for films made in or later and fully of those were for films made in or later so it seems like directors do vote for recent films but as someone else has pointed out theres not enough consensus yet on which recent films were the best so the votes get spread out more than for older films edit beau travail the recent movie that was lowest on the top received votes and goodfellas received
movies,not_removed,how does one ballot send the movie into the top from being outside the top a ballot gives one vote to each movie on the list
movies,not_removed,clearly their pretentious asses like different movies than i do maybe youre the pretentious one for feeling as if they should conform to your standard
movies,not_removed,totally my top ten consists of satantango jeanne dielman citizen kane mon oncle antoine do the right thing shoah pourquoi israel i am cuba reconstruction and the magnificent ambersons i had fun watching stuff like the blues brothers but often my favorite films are frighteningly fantastic and not just a fun time
movies,not_removed,its interesting pearl jam is still probably the bigger band as they had the longer career more sales more hits etc but nirvana is widely held as a more special or even the better band from what i can tell not by a large margin or anything nirvana just has that thing it was lightening in a bottle
movies,not_removed,yeah like pulp fiction still doesnt make them the best ever even coldplay is better
movies,not_removed,yes the film is definitely very stylized i thought the whole thing with the bright colors such as during the resurrection scene and having scenes that seemed to recur more than once made the film resemble a dream
movies,not_removed,i dont see them as stylistically similar i see them as similar in subject matter what modern movies are shot like that have a rhythm and shot length like that are black and white have outofsync dubbed dialogue with discrepancies between spoken lines and dubbed ones
movies,not_removed,an abstract artist
movies,not_removed,pretentious its a common saying someone who wants to make art for the sake of seeming cool
movies,not_removed,im not a troll i just think youre wrong
movies,not_removed,right but what about the
movies,not_removed,alien was before so does that make alien pretentious
movies,not_removed,i love fellowship alien and goodfellas but thinking that tokyo story citizen kane or apocalypse now are better films is not controversial or pretentious all of the listed movies pushed film forward and are still compelling and moving movies themselves youre basically asserting that people only like these films to sound smart which is absurd
movies,not_removed,exactly i actually dislike many of the films ive seen on this list but they are without a doubt the some of the most influential on the industry
movies,not_removed,my comment was obviously a bit of hyperbole but by ranking the new films all much lower you are condemning them compared to the older films not saying they are terrible but you are saying that theyre worse standing the test of time to me isnt what makes it a great film it being a great film is what makes it stand the test of time not including them here is essentially the directors saying that they cannot objectively rate the films without this in short i believe they are prejudiced against newer films but not maliciously so i think its a mix of nostalgia and indirect peer pressure these movies always show up on lists so more people vote for them next time
movies,not_removed,by the same token you cant just pick the newest movies because we havent had time to see how much theyve influenced other films yet
movies,not_removed,were not just talking about the influence of viewers were talking about how films have influenced other directors im not trying to take away from pulp fiction but i just dont think were finished setting how it has influenced other directors by contrast showed that scifi could be good instead of cheesy it showed that difficult shots were possible and worthwhile it showed that have abstract concepts in a film dont prevent success and it established a while genre apart from the kind youd expect on mystery science theater
movies,not_removed,dude
movies,not_removed,citizen kane isnt considered good because it had a good story citizen kane is considered one of the best movies of all time because it was groundbreaking so many new camera angles and shots that you see common now are from citizen kane the dark knight ultimately will most likely hold up as one of the best batman films nothing more
movies,not_removed,ok
movies,not_removed,i agree that the imdb list has an aorta of credibility which is why i compared it to bjs instead of pizza hut bjs does make decent pizzas nolan does make good movies but theyre not great movies i like dark knight a lot too but no it doesnt belong in any best movies of all time list maybe a best comic movie of all time contender
movies,not_removed,i understand where youre coming from but i think that there will always be people that love citizen kane and appreciate it for the great film that it is and there will always be people that dont get it or dont care people love beethovens symphonies too and those are hundreds of years old i wouldnt listen to them for fun because my appreciation of music doesnt go beyond rock music but i wont say that people going to an orchestra hall on weekends are just jerking each other off maybe some of them are but i wont waste my time worrying about who appreciates music and who is being pretentious
movies,not_removed,is still an awfully small amount in the grand scheme of things goodfellas being there makes me happy good work on collecting the info
movies,not_removed,yeah i drink your milkshake is totally deserving lol
movies,not_removed,pearl jam is still probably the bigger band as they had the longer career more sales more hits etc yeah that tends to happen when you dont swallow the end of a shotgun
movies,not_removed,nirvana died young so of course they seem more special
movies,not_removed,youre entitled to your own opinion but that one is bad
movies,not_removed,im pretty sure youre a troll but i also just want to point out that your pulp fiction and nirvana comparison is awful in no way did pulp fiction change the landscape of mainstream movies for years to come it didnt define a generation it introduced a lot of the mainstream public to tarantino and influenced a lot of filmmakers sure but it didnt even come close to the effect nirvana had culturally a better comparison would be comparing nirvana to the first scream movie as they both influenced the shape of their respected genres for years to come nirvana is a great band though with some awesome songs and pulp fiction is a great movie so if thats what you meant by the comparison then i can see that also coldplay has some good songs too
movies,not_removed,none that i know of but i also dont really see how that makes the movie dated either ive shown my friends the criterion collection blu ray for the film and they had absolutely no idea what year it came out until i told them
movies,not_removed,its a common saying which is why the word needs to die its become a word completely without meaning if your main criticism of a piece of art is that its pretentious you have nothing to offer to this conversation
movies,not_removed,i appreciate you thinking im wrong i certainly may be but saying code for paced differently strikes me as youre a kid with no attention span who cant deal with a camera shot of any duration im in my i understand and have the patience for good cinema honestly i havent seen kane in years so ill back off of that i could be full of shit but i watched again in the last few years i have patience for kubricks style i love the shining and a clockwork orange i stand by my wormhole statement cool in its day could be done on a cheap pc now what tripped out audiences then is too long now since the graphics seem lame by modern standards
movies,not_removed,theres films from the on the full list including one at i dont think theyre unfairly excluded especially from a decade that tends to be viewed as not that great for cinema
movies,not_removed,its not the list is missing years of film thats absurd but seeing as reddit is too bigoted to have an actual conversation with different viewpoints im gonna leave
movies,not_removed,standing the test of time to me isnt what makes it a great film it being a great film is what makes it stand the test of time yes that was my point it takes time to tell whether a film is great or not something that was praised in its day might lose esteem upon reexamination or vice versa older films have had the time to be reexamined over and over again they endure because they are great the crap ones fall to the wayside and are forgotten you simply cant know how a new work will shake out immediately
movies,not_removed,i also meant influence to directors pulp fiction was a huge influence to how timelines can be used in a movie
movies,not_removed,the dark knight will probably not even go down as the best nolan movie im guessing that distinction will go to memento
movies,not_removed,well its still percent of votes theres a lot of fun stuff i could do with this data ill try to get around to posting some of it soon doing top tens by decade would be interesting for example
movies,not_removed,im glad an entire film is only worth one quote
movies,not_removed,well the rolling stones are still second to the beatlesdespite jls murder and them never reuniting or putting out new albums since disbanding
movies,not_removed,in no way did pulp fiction change the landscape of mainstream movies for years to come it didnt define a generation it introduced a lot of the mainstream public to tarantino and influenced a lot of filmmakers sure but it didnt even come close to the effect nirvana had culturally i dont know how old you are but the effect pulp fiction had on film culture was for better or for worse immense after pulp fiction there was a new wave of films in american cinema that really hasnt been seen since every film student was trying to be the next tarantino some of the biggest breakout directors in the mid to late were total imitators it was near impossible to escape
movies,not_removed,nirvana is a great band though with some awesome songs and pulp fiction is a great movie so if thats what you meant by the comparison then i can see that not really both are cult things that teenagers love to brag about liking saying you like nirvana is by them seen as cool and edgy the same with pulp fiction a lot of people like it because of the marketing and coolness factor which is what i am talking about
movies,not_removed,its not my main criticism in any way
movies,not_removed,i stand by my wormhole statement cool in its day could be done on a cheap pc now then you probably lack a formal understanding of technical filmmaking which was my first reply to you because neither it nor citizen kane could be replicated on a cheap pc and if youre in your and stoop to proclaiming someone a troll that neither insulted nor flamed you but asked for clarification on your vague shallow criticisms you may still have some maturing to do as well
movies,not_removed,you have yet to present a real argument for why any of these movies should not be in the top the list not aligning with your tastes doesnt make it invalid or pretentious more recent movies were included in some directors lists but they werent universally selected like these ten were next time dont throw around a word like pretentious without understanding what the hell you are talking about
movies,not_removed,yeah definitely give it a shot
movies,not_removed,im you cant say pulp fiction had as near of an impact as nirvana did on pop culture i mentioned in my comment that it had an effect on filmmakers and obviously made a wave but if youre comparing pulp fiction to nirvana its like comparing a wave pool to a tsunami im not down playing the effect pulp fiction had on movies after it but nirvana was kind of a big fucking deal
movies,not_removed,youre generalising too much my friend i know a lot of people who enjoy watching pulp fiction because it is a very well made wrtten and directed movie that entertains from beginning to end this in itself proves that pulp fiction can at least be considered as one of the best you may not but im sure others will
movies,not_removed,then why is it the only criticism of the film youve been able to offer surely you wouldnt have to call it pretentious if you have any real criticisms
movies,not_removed,asked for clarification i guess i missed that i beg your pardon
movies,not_removed,if a list labelling itself greatest movies of all time skips about of the time films were being made and the period most films were probably made in then there is an omission isnt there i think snobbishly overlooking modern film is pretentious dont feel the need to reply i doubt youll have any kind of retort beyond a downvote and an insult
movies,not_removed,i did it post
movies,not_removed,i dont think any movie has ever or will ever have the same impact on pop culture as nirvana or any other band that defines a time period maybe star wars movies and music just arent on equal footing for influence over pop culture as a whole
movies,not_removed,youre dude you were fucking when kurt cobain died and pulp fiction came out what the fuck do you remember about
movies,not_removed,no doubt i also agree that nirvana is loved by many for what it is but i dont think thats why it is that popular it would have been big bit not huge if people didnt see it as cult no one would ever say outcast is one of the best bands ever but with nirvana it is a common saying
movies,not_removed,it would describe my main points boring story no point too much talk bw instead of colors pretentious actors really slow pace talking about movie making and all the things going on in film pretty women just there not doing much besides being attractive existential crisis in the lead actor there are a ton more things but all this can be described with one single word
movies,not_removed,pardoned
movies,not_removed,did you even attempt to look at the methodology in how the list was made many directors chose newer movies there will be blood in the mood for love and mulholland drive were on several lists the ten here were just selected by the highest number of directors meaning that they are more universal in their praise it makes sense that these movies are older as theyve had time to solidify their reputations and become essential viewing for fans of film they didnt snobbishly overlook newer films the consensus was that these ten are the best so again how the hell is that pretentious do you think all directors who submitted lists in this were acting in tandem to achieve maximum snobbiness do you know what pretentious means

movies,not_removed,most of yoda jedi quotes do or do not there is no trywhat trying is good master yoda only a sith deals in absolutes see above you must unlearn what you have learnedthat doesnt even make sense if no mistake have you made yet losing you are a different game you should playits possible to make no mistake and still loose thats not a weakness thats life
movies,not_removed,youve got to do whats right for you even if it hurts some people you love the notebook
movies,not_removed,ok steve harvey
movies,not_removed,it was a good line in novel when jenny says it it is cheesy but works for them classic case of words loosing their effect by overuse
movies,not_removed,i figured it was cause they are in the matrix like you are fighting their mind but yeah
movies,not_removed,this is because of the kung fu influence in their films but overall doesnt make sense because the movies in the series just fell apart
movies,not_removed,i think there is a point to which this is true physical violence brings out some pretty primal instincts and a weird level of intimacy between combatants think about when you were a kid you always seemed to become friends with a person you got into a fight with at least that was my experience same reason professional fighters who basically hate each other before a fight are all hugs and respect afterwards if it was a hard fight anyway im not saying we should go around fighting each other all the time but i see the point of the quote
movies,not_removed,i love your logic
movies,not_removed,do or do not there is no try this quote isnt about not needing to put in effort its about having confidence that your effort will succeed luke fails to lift his xwing out of the swamp because in his heart he doesnt believe its possible only a sith deals in absolutes obiwan kenobi said this not yoda and yeah its pretty much bullshit not least because its an absolute a much better version might be only a sith deals in those kinds of absolutes ie either with me or against me you must unlearn what you have learned luke is trying to harness the power of the force which allows for feats that fly in the face even of the rather loose physics of the star wars universe he has to learn to see and think of the universe in new ways after a lifetime of conditioning and habit this one makes perfect sense if no mistake you have made yet losing you are a different game you should play where is this one even from i dont remember it from any of the movies
movies,not_removed,i feel like you have no clue what the movies or characters were about
movies,not_removed,thats actually not a bad thing
movies,not_removed,if no mistake you have made yet losing you are a different game you should play where is this one even from i dont remember it from any of the movies star wars shatterpoint clone wars novel
movies,not_removed,i am sensing that you are wearing a underwear
movies,not_removed,counterpoint dont be a dick
movies,not_removed,alright then in that case id say it refers to the unpredictable vagaries of war if youre doing everything by the book and the enemy is kicking your ass then toss the book out and try something new again makes perfect sense
movies,not_removed,it is obvious that this thread cannot be decided by our knowledge of the force but by our skills with a lightsaber
movies,not_removed,good call the quote is referring to theory vs practice there are plenty of instances of conventional doctrine and strategy losing to unconventional tactics thats why guerrilla and insurgency warfare is so effective against superior conventional forces
movies,not_removed,maybe if by select theaters you mean whichever indie theater decides on its own to do this if there was some sort of organized effort thered definitely be something on the internet about it
movies,not_removed,ugh this is not a thing to celebrate
movies,not_removed,it might be a fathom event but normally those tend to be listed as fathom events in the system but still id expect to see some news about it i have a photograph that i dont mind sharing as soon as i can get it uploaded
movies,not_removed,come on and slam my man
movies,not_removed,space jam contains about of the comic invention that the looney tunes characters had in their original shorts
movies,not_removed,so thats just your opinion there are tons of people who love this movie more than you think apparently and the fact that it is coming back to theaters is a pretty big deal especially for those who saw it in theaters originally or only got to see it on vhs in the gives people a chance to see it on the big screen as well as introduce it to a neweryounger audience despite the fact that its out on vhsdvd and im sure soon if not already bluray i know for me as well as many others nothing beats seeing a movie on the big screen with a crowd of people especially a crowd of fans of the content up on screen its the reason rocky horror picture show shadow productions happen around the world and have a pretty good attendance people love celebrating the content they love with others who love it just as much as they do but i get it man space jam just isnt your shit but you dont have to go putting it down
movies,not_removed,not a movie but i think you all would really enjoy the zero gravity scenes in the show the expanse they are the most realistic given their context that ive seen yet
movies,not_removed,a space odyssey has some very cool zero gravity sequences
movies,not_removed,not a movie but this music video was pretty amazing
movies,not_removed,enders game
movies,not_removed,apollo mainly because theyre simulating actual events that took place in zero g by filming in what was effectively zero g
movies,not_removed,apollo they shot the movie in actual zero gravity
movies,not_removed,inception had a sort of zero gravity sequence
movies,not_removed,thanks any links i couldnt find it
movies,not_removed,yeah it was great turns out inceptions scene was heavily inspired by that
movies,not_removed,star trek also have some zero g moments even if it feels more like an adrenaline race
movies,not_removed,ive been avoiding seeing enders game this sealed it i cant
movies,not_removed,how did they film in zero g
movies,not_removed,oh nevermind i found out how
movies,not_removed,near zero g
movies,not_removed,thanks
movies,not_removed,thanks these are both awesome
movies,not_removed,by filming on a plane that would fly up at a steep angle then arc down again and plummet toward the ground at the apogee top of the arc objects and people inside the plane experience weightlessness that is effectively zero g this is the same sort of thing astronauts would go through during training to prepare them for the effective zero g in space there have been a number of such planes used by nasa all of them given the nickname vomit comet
movies,not_removed,everything we call zero g is near zero g astronauts and cosmonauts on the iss are falling toward earth but because of the curvature of earth its an infinite fall astronauts in deep space are still within the gravity of the sun and other bodies etc its not a question of if theres g but how strongly g is acting upon the person or object in question
movies,not_removed,yeah i learned about those types of planes when i went to space camp in huntsville i just didnt think the apollo production team would actually film with that technique because the zero g effect is so short lived
movies,not_removed,you say we but when its near zero g i say near zero g the only time i say zero g is when im talking theories
movies,not_removed,its exactly what they did they built an apollo capsule set inside a plane and ran many many many flights
movies,not_removed,which is pretty irrelevant to the topic and sub youre really reaching to be pedantic here bub
movies,not_removed,yeah cant put anything past hollywood
movies,not_removed,lol i know you are but what am i
movies,not_removed,the departed
movies,not_removed,dawn of the dead
movies,not_removed,i dont know if it counts but he thing is pretty great its loosely based on the film the thing from another world
movies,not_removed,the thing

movies,not_removed,cape fear
movies,not_removed,a lot of people will disagree but i prefer the newer amityville horror the old one im sure was great in its day but it shows its age and lumbers along at times
movies,not_removed,dont be mad but i quite enjoy the italian job remake with marky mark ive never seen the original but the new one is quite fun
movies,not_removed,dredd was basically one big apology for the first judge dredd movie would the fugitive count its based on an older tv show not a movie
movies,not_removed,scarface
movies,not_removed,quick question what exactly defines a remake ive been under the impression that if movies are based on the same book ie charlie and the chocolate factory its not a remake but just another adaptation that being said i loved manns heat the story is so close to manns made for tv movie la takedown that i consider it a remake
movies,not_removed,christopher nolans insomnia is solid
movies,not_removed,the fly the thing the invasion of the bodysnatchers dawn of the dead scarface fistful of dollars the departed the beat that my heart skipped cape fear the hills have eyes insomnia no way out ransom true lies
movies,not_removed,one of the obvious choices
movies,not_removed,definitely counts undisputed classic
movies,not_removed,definitely those are pretty good
movies,not_removed,im not big into westerns but this is a great movie
movies,not_removed,ill agree with true grit
movies,not_removed,when did the remake of a fistful of dollars come out i was unaware of it and cant seem to find it on imdb
movies,not_removed,wowie theres two of us
movies,not_removed,i did like the remake i remember it being pretty creepy
movies,not_removed,i guess its a grey area really most films that are linked to others like charlie and the chocolate factory are considered remakes because people just cant help but compare them but maybe itd be more accurate to say a remake is a film which derives its plot directly from another ie oldboy where as films like charlie and the chocolate factory had the book as well as the film to use as material
movies,not_removed,yeah like i dont consider spielbergs war of the worlds a remake just another adaptation
movies,not_removed,fistful of dollars is a remake of yojimbo
movies,not_removed,now if someone is nice enough to list all movies featured in the video
movies,not_removed,the stepford wives meets guess whos coming dinner what an original take youve got there reviewer
movies,not_removed,this is a good way to ruin your
movies,not_removed,check the forums at originaltrilogycom there are tons of fan edits there not just star wars
movies,not_removed,wow thanks never heard of them gonna have a lot of things to waste my summer on now
movies,not_removed,i found a complete version of uproar in heaven there some dude sat down and used so much of his time putting a complete version together from multiple sources color corrected it all and added a bunch of localized soundtracks harmys star wars despecialized editions also originated from there
movies,not_removed,the story was a jumbled stupid mess to me it seemed like a good example of what happens when too many studio execs demand changes to the screenplay but i dont know thats what happened
movies,not_removed,pretty disappointed we wont see tron after he started fighting for the user again
movies,not_removed,it was well received enough to have a sequel greenlit temporarily it was tomorrowlands failure that spooked disney away from highbudget middling audience scifi movies
movies,not_removed,pacing and story basically i just remember it being really boring at certain parts it received mediocre reactions from both critics and audiences and that was that
movies,not_removed,it had virtually the same story as the original movie
movies,not_removed,i think i saw it posted here recently that tron legacy was the greatest music video ever made which i think sums it up perfectly too much style over substance disney should hand the tron franchise to pixar its essential a live action cartoon and those guys know how to do a story right
movies,not_removed,you said it yourself the story
movies,not_removed,beyond the visuals and soundtrack the film had very little going for it im surprised it gets so much love on here
movies,not_removed,the music the soundtrack for the original was far superior to me daft punk only need the first half of their name
movies,not_removed,well that and disneys acquisition of lucasfilm and marvel tron and john carter were their attempts to appeal to young males a demographic theyd historically had a tough time appealing to once they had star wars and a successful comic book franchise in their stable they really didnt need to develop their own properties any more
movies,not_removed,the beast still doesnt feel beastlyhe looks like he should be modeling
movies,not_removed,i wonder how older he will be in this movie
movies,not_removed,cant help but feel there are too many comic book movies these days but i still watched this and came away quite satisfied cucumber face did well
movies,not_removed,mister doctor strange
movies,not_removed,i was starting to think we werent allowed to mention dr strange on here because it hadnt came out in the good old us of a anyway its a top notch film that deserves to be a success the visual representation of magic is amazingly well done and the set pieces are appropriately mind bending
movies,not_removed,i feel the first part was very rushed i liked that rich lifestyle bit mads mikkelsen was pretty disposable cgi was insane i could do with more mind bending new york when they stop for a second between skyscrapers it looks so nice
movies,not_removed,i watched this mainly for mads mikkelsen and tilda swinton and i wish i got more mads mikkelsen in fact i wish he was dr strange because i want to see his comedic skills in a hollywood film
movies,not_removed,i really enjoyed this i dont think a lot of the current generation avenger fans will i think his win is very dr strange a la comics and i dont think that meshes with what we have seen from the mcu so far i am very happy about it but dont think the masses will be
movies,not_removed,not surprising the film is a decent effort that follows the usual marvel formula give or take a little and benefits from great acting in the majority of lead roles and stunning visual effects i personally struggle with the marvel films at times as i find them repetitive and too long but came away pleased with dr strange and would recommend people go see it
movies,not_removed,the reviews are good too will definitely watch
movies,not_removed,benedoct strangepants strange edict doctor patch
movies,not_removed,i feel like this movie has been in your face with the advertisement so much that its made me not want to watch it im so torn
movies,not_removed,im hoping it bombs just so i can see articles titled dr strange or how i came to love the bomb
movies,not_removed,this looks like shit we wont have to put up with these lame comic book movies much longer once a few of them bomb in a row itll be back to original creative films again i cant wait
movies,not_removed,dont care bout that only important for me is the us numbers
movies,not_removed,its not a feeling there are a lot of comic book movies coming out now good for audience but it feels weird i hope we dont get burned out by these movies quick
movies,not_removed,we all know when every single one is coming out stop acting like this is a surprise
movies,not_removed,mister doctor strange
movies,not_removed,there was an initial and then a wide release review thread
movies,not_removed,top notch film yeah you got your godfather your pulp fiction your citizen kane and your doctor strange
movies,not_removed,as someone who doesnt know anything about comics i fucking loved it didnt like the avengers or avengers ii though felt they were incredibly average
movies,not_removed,i think it hits a similar area that the first thor movie did no forced laughsdialogue well paced story bit fantasyscifi i think strange pulls it off better and a world defined by the characters in it it should do well with a wide audience in my opinion
movies,not_removed,its good but nothing special because it lack any sort of depth everything else is kinda okay feels like the very watered down marvelized version of what could have been a batman begins
movies,not_removed,obviously its because you havent seen their
movies,not_removed,really i saw next to no advertising for this film where im from new zealand i saw it opening night and granted i live in a smaller city but the place was empty considering its marvel
movies,not_removed,i just watched it last night benadryl cumbersnatchs accent threw me off at first but he and the main cast were great and the special effects were really trippy in a good way story was predictable and boring but the action and acting were great
movies,not_removed,what
movies,not_removed,this just in opinions exist
movies,not_removed,well this one aint bombing so you gonna have to wait a little longer
movies,not_removed,you do understand that youre not getting comic book movies instead of original films are you marvel studios isnt going to be producing character dramas any time this millenium and even if comic book movies start bombing consecutively theres just going to be another slew of mindless blockbusters to take their place at least these ones are good fun
movies,not_removed,the goal is to get a great lakes avengers movie and then we can stop couple it with deadpool ii and well finally realize the whole thing has gone so far round its eating its own tail and the meta cycle is complete
movies,not_removed,honestly these days i just ignore every comic book movie not made by marvel studios exept deadpool even though their movies area bit formulaic theyre the only studio that seems to actually try to make good superhero movies
movies,not_removed,can you remember people were saying this in before the mcu even started it hasnt happened quick but im ready for it to burn out
movies,not_removed,mister doctor strange mantis toboggan
movies,not_removed,doesnt come out in the states until nov ill bet you on that day youll see a big old sticky post on here about it
movies,not_removed,why be so salty i didnt compare it to those films so why should you
movies,not_removed,i liked the villain as well hes no loki but hes got charisma and a reason for doing what hes doing beyond kill everyone
movies,not_removed,did that break into the dark knight music at the end
movies,not_removed,same in the uk all ive seen are fantastic beasts adverts and thats not out for a few more weeks
movies,not_removed,well advertising is a highly regionalized thing its not super surprising that a little place like new zealand wouldnt get a huge campaign
movies,not_removed,bad joke i guess
movies,not_removed,would it be crass to say that the marvel films are objectively better given the critical reception that they receive from hundreds of critics
movies,not_removed,even if it did bomb there are so many movies in the alone that had bombed but are now considered cult classics today im also getting somewhat tired of comic book movies but every so often we get great gems like iron man deadpool the dark knight xmen first class and guardians of the galaxy im hoping to add doctor strange to that list
movies,not_removed,its been years since xmen kicked off this stretch of comic book movies along the way weve had a lot of other successes like the raimi spiderman trilogy nolan batman etc superhero movies arent a fad but are a legit money making genre that audiences worldwide seem to like a lot
movies,not_removed,marvels upping their game to movies per year starting next year so if you thought there were a ton this year just wait for the next couple of years
movies,not_removed,an unbeatable squirrel girl comic had an entire section featuring sgs mom talking about how a doctor originally diagnosed her as having mutantlike powers but is specifically definitely not a mutant and never had been my thinking is thats there surgically specifically for film licensing reasons edit httpnerdistcommarvelssquirrelgirlisnolongeramutant
movies,not_removed,no no no mantis doesnt come out until guardians of the galaxy vol
movies,not_removed,lol it was just a joke about how people toss around things like top notch film alot
movies,not_removed,im waiting for mordo in the sequel honestly
movies,not_removed,not the opinion itself no just the dickish way you flaunt it
movies,not_removed,this people keep saying omg not moar superhero movies its a fucking genre just like how their are westerns and thrillers there are superhero movies and theyll be here for a long time
movies,not_removed,and if you want to count the batmansuperman movies from way long ago
movies,not_removed,i really appreciated north biting that bullet despite how awkward it was i feel sg needs to bring flatman mr i bertha and doorman to make it a better picture hopefully they can iron out any xmen licensing problems in their current series
movies,not_removed,its the most top notch film about a surgeon turned sorcerer supreme of earth that ive ever seen 🍻😉
movies,not_removed,theyre a subgenre theyre pretty much all action movies
movies,not_removed,ok im into comics but i feel like you just made those names up
movies,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikidrstrangefilm
movies,not_removed,you didnt give your opinion you condescendingly stated that other people still havent realized something you seem to have found out
movies,not_removed,the great lakes avengersdidnt want them xmenneither did they champions flatman won the hulks poker tournament are a fantastic series worth checking out
movies,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikigreatlakesavengers
movies,not_removed,i have though 😏 id honestly say that it was the best film about a surgeon becoming the sorcerer supreme of earth
movies,not_removed,that wasnt what you said you said you couldnt understand how others didnt see they were terrible thats because like your opinion they also have opinions that they are awesome probably the reason why they make billions
movies,not_removed,maybe just realize that maybe people like something you dont i love most of the marvel movies think they do comic book movies better than any other studio and are more faithful to the comics than dc sony and fox but hey you dont have to like them and i wont look down at you for it just go enjoy the movies you like well stick with these
movies,not_removed,yea see im done youre just a jerk off thats why youre getting downvoted respect other peoples opinions if you dont like the movies youre pretty much only here to troll im done feeding you
movies,not_removed,are you going to make me lmao this guy
movies,not_removed,xmen singer wasnt involved in origins
movies,not_removed,its not rare if it exists on the internet
movies,not_removed,rare footage eh how many little boys lost their lives for this information
movies,not_removed,this video is unavailable sorry about that i guess its rare again
movies,not_removed,its not rare any more i just download it times
movies,not_removed,or more importantly how many bothans
movies,not_removed,wilson cmon
movies,not_removed,i never cared that much about the reboot because the original never meant that much to me i saw it when it came out in i knew it popular and it was ok but it did not matter a lot to me when the sequel came out i didnt care that much either yet for being disinterested in it i am being called sexist by a bunch of people who i am sure never went to bad moms or absolutely fabulous amusing
movies,not_removed,read the article the writer gives a much better review than the title would first seem to indicate
movies,not_removed,i stand corrected
movies,not_removed,google even says it is directed by wes anderson
movies,not_removed,are you fucking serious ive heard more than i ever wanted to about steve jobs
movies,not_removed,in theatres october
movies,not_removed,boo bitches
movies,not_removed,this is a movie that will sell out opening night and then be gone from the theater in weeks because of poor ticket sales
movies,not_removed,i thought it was going to be a link to a joke trailer cut from scenes of other trailers even though its real thats what it looked like i dont mind tyler perry but i hate madea the female character played by a dude always confused the shit out of me whyyyy also daaaaaamn bella thorne looks fine as helll
movies,not_removed,best picture im calling it now
movies,not_removed,so the shitty version of ernest scared stupid
movies,not_removed,i saw the trailer for this i hate madea i hate the character the attitude everything about herbut that being said this movie looks pretty funny
movies,not_removed,hahathrewheroff she was sinkingi yelled for her to swim
movies,not_removed,yeah madea and ms hattie this movies gonna be epic﻿
movies,not_removed,why o why
movies,not_removed,sheeeees back
movies,not_removed,is boo bitches related to beau bitches
movies,not_removed,itll be on martin scorseses top madea films every film school student should watch
movies,not_removed,i think ernest scared stupid is the shitty version of ernest scared stupid
movies,not_removed,yaknowi threw natalie wood off a boat
movies,not_removed,the family moralizing in his films is blah to methis shows non of that and is a perfect match for medeas bigger than life unreality
movies,not_removed,looks like someone shouldve tried drag
movies,not_removed,i didnt think conan had such an impact on stop motion
movies,not_removed,if you like this theres a documentary sort of a documentary i guess im not sure what its called when its mostly just interviews with other people talking about him on netflix on ray harryhausen who is mentioned in this video as being inspired by obrien its pretty interestingentertaining
movies,not_removed,head writer for the simpsons famous talk show host pioneering stop motion animator is there anything conan obrien cant do
movies,not_removed,i cant find it are you sure its on there
movies,not_removed,damn thats where i saw it itd be a shame if they cycled it out
movies,not_removed,i think it only helps the relationship between people and special people
movies,not_removed,there is nothing wrong with that movie it had a good heart and showed that the mentally handicapped are no different than normal people with the ability to laugh at themselves also doesnt johnny knoxville still keep in touch with some of the disabled people he worked with on that movie
movies,not_removed,the gave the special olympics committee final say on the script
movies,not_removed,because it helped foster a good attitude about handicapped people apparently when you see them you assume that simply depicting them mocks them
movies,not_removed,it was made in a time years ago where people didnt take things to seriously yet
movies,not_removed,i feel like of you have this attitude you probably havent seen the movie
movies,not_removed,that apostrophe is killing me
movies,not_removed,point break one of the greatest action movies of all time is directed by a woman
movies,not_removed,a league of their own penny marshall
movies,not_removed,im extremely skeptical of that
movies,not_removed,hes the executive producer so his opinion matters little show us what bill murray has to say about it
movies,not_removed,httpiimgurcomsteeetejpg
movies,not_removed,i fear that it will turn out to have much forced humor in it and the story will get lost imo beeing funny is not the main point of a ghostbuster movie
movies,not_removed,newscom saying what the administration tells us
movies,not_removed,this article is funnier for sure i fell out of my chair
movies,not_removed,dan is telling fibs he has to though sony is notorious for these kinds of pr contractsahem fantastic four got everybody in the cast and whatnot praising heavily beforehand it will be up soon enough and everyone involved will be honest we already know how bad it is so attempts to hide it are futile
movies,not_removed,dan is either insane or being payed off
movies,not_removed,i sure hope so otherwise there is no point in making it i have hope
movies,not_removed,see this is what ive noticed the main point of ghostbusters varies from person to person for me it was always a comedy first there seems to be no real consensus of what ghostbusters should be classified as
movies,not_removed,you wouldnt classify ghostbusters as a comedy primarily
movies,not_removed,what is the point of it thats what i got from the first one
movies,not_removed,fear your fear is reality
movies,not_removed,it was funny but i have the feeling at least from the trailer got to see the full movie ofc that now its just way to much forced and focused on humor nearly adam sandlerish
movies,not_removed,will wait till its out and see what others say but this doesnt sound good im probably better off expecting nothing
movies,not_removed,what would you say the main point of ghostbusters is
movies,not_removed,what do you think is the main point of a movie
movies,not_removed,depends on the movie laughs are generally the main point of a comedy
movies,not_removed,i agree op the fact that theyd even consider not having the crawl is absolutely ridiculous i have no idea why people on here think that its okay to not have a crawl in a fucking star wars movie
movies,not_removed,this a thousand times over it has opened almost every video game animated series etc for years it is ridiculous to even consider rogue one shouldnt have it on the argument that it needs to drop it to stand apart from the trilogy
movies,not_removed,i wouldnt worry too much about it man that opening crawl is a distinguishing narrative feature it would be a foolish reason to leave it out just because its not part of the main series
movies,not_removed,i know its just a video game but i think itd be interesting if rogue one were to take the route that star wars republic commando did for those who arent familiar with it republic commando did away with the opening crawl and delivered its expository text via a series of title cards during which a variation of the emperors theme played as a means of introducing each of its three missions it was a very effective means of setting the tone for one of the darker chapters of the star wars expanded universe and could work for rogue one as well ps before anyone gets the wrong idea im only suggesting that the filmmakers could do this as a substitute for the opening crawl not at any point within the main body of the film edit
movies,not_removed,i totally agree for me it doesnt count as star wars if you dont have that beginning its what makes me go hell yeah star wars time
movies,not_removed,you make good points i agree
movies,not_removed,they should keep everything that makes star wars star wars
movies,not_removed,i think removing it is like removing the gun barrel from the new james bond movies its just straight disrespect to the originals and the creator
movies,not_removed,if they have it they have it if they dont they dont maybe they should throw episode crawl in at the end
movies,not_removed,i agree that it would feel off without the crawl but that may be a desired effect i am okay with seeing how the anthology films plays out with trying different things maybe they wont stray from the formula too much but id like them to have the freedom to do so and if that includes the music the crawl and the title screen so be it if gareth edwards wants the crawl it should be there if not then it shouldnt that being said i expect that it will be there simply because the film directly ties into the original trilogy
movies,not_removed,i doubt the crawl will be there as the theme wont be there
movies,not_removed,as a nonstar wars fan i would disagree and say no it doesnt need the crawl its just a star wars story just the advertising for it feels very different from a traditional star wars film thus far given that its not an episode there likely wont even be those two magnificent words at least not as we traditionally know them rogue one will be on the screen first and i cant see the star wars theme fitting into the tone of the film in any way so that probably wont be there either the crawl should stay within the episodes on the bigscreen
movies,not_removed,i dont think we need it in the film that crawl should always be accompanied by the star wars theme and i dont think we really need that in rogue one either
movies,not_removed,id be ok if they left it out besides they already ditched the century fox logo that came before it so why not skip the crawl
movies,not_removed,i understand the nostalgic appeal but i think at this point in a larger likely the largest film franchise you almost have to abandon some of the superficially memorable parts of the original or risk getting stale
movies,not_removed,meh a crawl isnt gonna make or break the movie
movies,not_removed,so the two options are rogue one or perhaps different star wars movies down the line dont have the crawl literally every single star wars movie one per year until end of time has the the crawl obviously its option a and this conundrum is pointless
movies,not_removed,itt op making a post regarding his opinion as the be all and end all and refuting all others regardless
movies,not_removed,i would be fine with them changing the color of the font for the stand alone films
movies,not_removed,i think you need to think what do you want in that crawleven the first movie had things to set up for the moviecrawl makes sense rogue one really is a short story just before the first onei dont think characters are that important themselves before this adventureyou cant make a title crawl for these characters saying things about empire and rebellion war can be a thingbut what else can they include in it afaikmovie is about a rogue group of rebellion fighters that accidentally get their hands on death star plans dont be all we need it in a star wars moviewhat would you include in rogue one title crawl
movies,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised if they just twisted the opening slightly say have a cold opening scene and then cut to black star wars zooms silently to a star field eerie an iconic moment made dark
movies,not_removed,there are plenty of valid reasons to not include a crawl in these spinoff films the crawl is perfect for two things instantly establishing an epic space opera mood the music obviously helps and familiarizing the audience with the current state of affairs in the galaxy obviously the saga films benefit from these two things but it could feel totally out of place if disney experiments with other types of genre films set in the star wars universe a lot of movies benefit from having the audience know absolutely nothing at the start of the film imagine if memento had the equivalent of a crawl imagine if pulp fiction had a crawl what if the han solo movie turns out to be han getting into hijinks at corellia high school wouldnt a crawl feel unnecessarily epic
movies,not_removed,i think if you arent the artist and you arent creating it you should probably butt out really doesnt affect anything in your life at all
movies,not_removed,but if were going to get a standalone film every other year this will establish a precident i dont think theyre all going to need the crawl
movies,not_removed,what would you put into rogue one crawl
movies,not_removed,thats a really good point the way that i see it is that if you have the intro on all the movies except one it looks sloppy and disrespectful so do it right and have it on all of them
movies,not_removed,did you see the part in my post where i included links to many star wars stories that arent episodes in the main skywalker saga each of those contain a crawl before the start of the story and that was just a handful many others do as well another star wars story — quite literally its a book it came out recently since the new canon was released and it has nothing to do with the skywalkers or the episodes whatsoever but its still star wars and like all star wars adventures it begins with a crawl that sets the scene and the tone and rogue one should be no exception
movies,not_removed,that crawl should always be accompanied by the star wars theme and i dont think we really need that in rogue one either you do realize that this movie is a star wars story right the classic star wars theme is not the same as binary sunset the latter of which more so identifies with the skywalkers as i mentioned in the post look how many star wars stories have used the crawl — and thats just a handful sure there are some that have not but rogue one is our first sidestory film — why should we break tradition now when the vast majority of star wars media including recent media like books comics and video games have included the crawl it almost sounds like you dont even want this movie to be affiliated with the star wars franchise at all
movies,not_removed,thats not really a reason
movies,not_removed,because the century fox logo was a branding logo and did not directly impact the content of the film if tomorrow they removed the crawl from a new hope would you be okay with that of course not because the crawl is iconic as it is with all star wars media the century fox logo while iconic and has some history with star wars stands on its own the crawl is integrated into the content of star wars itself which is why it would be jarring to have it removed
movies,not_removed,but it makes it inconsistent i like one of the other analogies i read itd be like the classic james bond intros where he shoots down the barrel of the gun and suddenly they skip that for just one movie it would be sloppy the same applies here
movies,not_removed,i would prefer option b every movie has the crawl
movies,not_removed,neither episode i nor episode iv really said anything about the characters themselves its absolutely possible to set up the movie even if the characters arent as memorable for the movie but you get the idea its absolutely doable and it should be
movies,not_removed,and completely missing the point of internet forums
movies,not_removed,the tradition has been established since new hope they have been doing opening crawls for cartoons too
movies,not_removed,a long time ago in a galaxy far far away star wars rogue one the once prosperous republic has crumbled under the sinister rule of the galactic empire suffering countless losses a brave rebellion faces a battle at every turn unbeknownst to the rebels an unseen threat looms over the galaxy once revealed this new evil will strike fear in all that oppose the empire with little time to spare mon mothma leader of the rebellion pleads her cause to the imperial senate in the hope that more star systems will join in their fight for freedom i literally just wrote that
movies,not_removed,no i somehow managed to miss what is a large part of your argument because apparently i cant read not just because i happen to disagree with you i think rogue one should be the exception thats my opinion no need to be so dismissive
movies,not_removed,the classic star wars theme is not the same as binary sunset the latter of which more so identifies with the skywalkers actually the star wars is theme is lukes theme while binary sunset is based upon the forcebens theme
movies,not_removed,i obviously know star wars and i know this is a star wars story i still think the creative on future movies shouldnt be held to those parts of the formula because its unneccessary for a lot of the stories they want to tell what makes you think i dont want this to be part of the franchise im really excited for rogue one and i said nothing bad about it
movies,not_removed,like you think rogue one needs the theme or you think the crawl hasnt always had it
movies,not_removed,i dont know i was really disappointed when i didnt hear the century fox music over the lucasfilms logo in front of force awakens it felt wrong to me its that music going into the silence when it says a long time ago in a galaxy far far away that makes the star wars opening so iconic
movies,not_removed,meh its already inconsistent its not an episode which is a first for a star wars movie itd be like skipping the james bond intro on a james bond spinoff movie that didnt have james bond in it differentiate its not a regular star wars movie so regular star wars conventions need not necessarily apply
movies,not_removed,obviously i know star wars but they have a chance to establish a new norm for the standalone films do the soundtracks always have to sound like john williams too i think they should be able to play with the style if it suits the film
movies,not_removed,well thats not bad for a quick stab at it but i doubt mon mothma would openly call for rebellion in the imperial senate maybe with individual senators in private but in any case theres little chance they open any star wars film for a long time with a political scene
movies,not_removed,with little time to spare mon mothma leader of the rebellion pleads her cause to the imperial senate in the hope that more star systems will join in their fight for freedom what do you think the title rogue one means in the story is it a shipor a rogue fighter
movies,not_removed,i think theme should be in thereits iconic and can ne used in the moviecreatively title crawl is there to give some basic info and starting context to the movie i really cant make a case for things to put into crawl its a very small adventure compared to glalactic war
movies,not_removed,why are you talking to me about the soundtrack are you replying to the right person also why are you telling me that opening crawl must be accompanied by a soundtrack i dont care about that the purpose of opening crawl isnt to showcase a soundtrack its suppose to create narrative context for the film
movies,not_removed,i got the idea about mon mothma appealing to the senate based on a line from a new hope during the conference room scene with the imperial generals they are bickering about the death star and one of them mentions that the rebels are continuing to gain sympathy in the senate so if she isnt pleading their case in front of the entire senate maybe shes doing it in backwater channels then maybe the wording is changed so that the crawl says that shes en route to those meetings rather than opening up with the meetings directly
movies,not_removed,theyve played the same theme for all films so it has as much precident as the crawl itself does do you always downvote people who disagree with you
movies,not_removed,if anything i imagine back channnels like the story arc in ep deleted scenes where shes meeting with senators but to do it openly in a totalitarian society like the empire is a surefire way to get yourself killed quickly i have a feeling the film will open with the empire maybe mads mikkelsens character overseeing a weapons test or something like that
movies,not_removed,again are you replying to the right person
movies,not_removed,thats a nice tactic just come up with some shitty thing to keep repeating so you dont have to form any real argument
movies,not_removed,i love that bill paxton is the reason why hudson is so fondly remembered his final scene was all adlibed he was originally written to just get ganked without him going out guns blazing his character would have just been a braggart and a coward not the badass we remember him as
movies,not_removed,awesome thanx for sharing this
movies,not_removed,they represented mans inhumanity to man eithercthat of waffles

movies,not_removed,if you liked krampus you may want to check out
movies,not_removed,poultrygeist night of the chicken dead really anything by lloyd kaufman or from the tromaville universe its all incredibly ridiculous
movies,not_removed,sleepaway camp everytime avoid researching or watching clips of this movie
movies,not_removed,are these real i cant find them anywhere
movies,not_removed,i thought krampus was pretty mediocre in terms of unintended humor i mostly saw it for the heck of the krampusness
movies,not_removed,could you at least give me a short rundown
movies,not_removed,your mistake was not realizing krampus is a good film
movies,not_removed,cinematography is one of those things that if its done well you shouldnt notice if its effective and compelling enough to convey the story then it should be the story that grabs your attention if youre instead noticing camera tricks and blocking and lighting then theyve been too blatant and stolen focus
movies,not_removed,c i n e m a t o g r a p h y
movies,not_removed,thats definitely not always the case
movies,not_removed,some people consume films differently im sure individuals who have taken a film class began to process their experiences with a more watchful eye
movies,not_removed,utter nonsense cinema is a visual art when i watch a movie i want to see beautiful and striking photography yes sometimes it can get too over the top but even that is preferable to bland realistic imagery
movies,not_removed,like i said ive seen it at least or times so i wasnt focused on the plot or the jokes etc
movies,not_removed,sorry whats that
movies,not_removed,la haine is one of the most rewatchable french films imo and the films message still resonate today
movies,not_removed,incredible film one of those that you never forget so far so good
movies,not_removed,such an amazing shot love that movie
movies,not_removed,i think they would have used a crane in this instance but still a cool scene regardless
movies,not_removed,if la haine were released last week it would be the most timely and talkedabout movie of the year
movies,not_removed,actually op is right though its not a drone as we think of it today it was shot on something called flyingcam it was a remote controlled toy sized helicopter with an unmovable camera attached to it a crane would have much smoother movements and couldnt go through trees and tight spaces like this could
movies,not_removed,cant help but wonder if the keks mean this is trolling
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,ok im not trolling gonna remove the keks
movies,not_removed,why post this again you enjoy down votes
movies,not_removed,weve already had this thread today
movies,not_removed,fuck off you just posted this
movies,not_removed,my remake is called the detour that way ill be free to rip off the entire original movie and the we hate remakes crowd will be oblivious to my efforts they were quiet when an affair to remember was remade as autumn in new york they did not care when sons of katie elder was remade as brothers they wont care about the detour either
movies,not_removed,zidanezidane theres nobody else just zidane
movies,not_removed,is one of the strings named kubo
movies,not_removed,its most likely a shamisen more of a banjo than a guitar the top is made of skin rather than wood
movies,not_removed,maybe its supposed to have five and the movie is about him looking for the missing two
movies,not_removed,its abstract but makes more sense after youve seen the movie i dont want to give away too much also its a shamisen not a guitar so it has strings
movies,not_removed,i dont think its a guitar i thought it was a sanxian a chinese stringed instrument with only strings httpsenmwikipediaorgwikisanxian
movies,not_removed,why does the guitar in kubo and the two strings have three strings
movies,not_removed,that list has some pretty bad movies on it some good ones but a lot of bad ones youd be forcing yourself ot watch or ones probably targeted at a different demographic im not into horror or kids films for example so im not gonna force myself to sit through alvin the chipmunks your list also doesnt seem to adjust for inflation youll miss out on a lot of classics your list is going to end up being too usfocused if its going by box office numbers some of the best classic films came from france japan italy germany persia spain and sweden that werent big at the us box office or globally
movies,not_removed,why bother why not actually go through a good list instead of going through a list that i guarantee you is mediocre or shit
movies,not_removed,where do you find time to watch so many movies and where do you get these movies from netflix
movies,not_removed,maybe he realized that he needs to move on neil helps get him a job at his company he gets his life together finds a nice apartment finds a nice woman who works in accounting ya know that nice woman janet they embark on a multi year long relationship and del realizes its what his dead wife would have wanted and he sets down his emotional baggage they decide to tie the knot and they lived happily ever after but of course they spend every thanksgiving and christmas with the page family
movies,not_removed,id imagine the pages would help del out for a bit that thanksgiving would end off with neal and del recanting their entirely crazy trip to the mrs i dont see del staying in the page household long maybe just a few days perhaps neal sets him up with some cash but i could see del actually having some money to his name but reluctant to acquire as it could be inheritance or a life insurance policy from his late wife neal could help del cope with his wifes death and confront his fear of going home cue the if only dream sequel seeing neal and del travel across the country back to the griffith homestead each mile closer brings del closer to breaking down neal has trouble trying to comfort his friend as hes never had to endure his struggles tears may flow like in the i like me my wife likes me scene but hilarity could ensue thats just an idea an afterthought but id like to think neal and del become closer friends and del was able to fully cope with the loss of his wife and find his way home
movies,not_removed,and maybe neals boss would finally decide which ad he wants to publish
movies,not_removed,the pianist forgotten good one
movies,not_removed,its been speculated brody wrecked his career because after he won the oscar in for his performance in this film he fashioned himself as a leading man despite his offbeat looks offers for those roles werent exactly rolling in so he started accepting a lot of crap productions and hes in a bit of a brendan fraser predicament at present because hes picked so many bad projects
movies,not_removed,the fact that adrian brody broke up wish his girlfriend to better portray sadness for this movie is one of the funnieststupidest things ive ever heard haha still a great movie though
movies,not_removed,probably my favorite role of his
movies,not_removed,i just fucking ruined this movie for myself i was watching the opening scene and it made me curious whether brody spoiler boom thats it beginning and ending of movie ruined fuck
movies,not_removed,yeah man and one of those things that reflects in the performance due to the commitment
movies,not_removed,a great actor doesnt need reallife sadness to portray a sad character
movies,not_removed,obviously there are death starshaped clouds on this planet cunning place to disguise a real death star
movies,not_removed,you have great taste my good man
movies,not_removed,why thank you
movies,not_removed,i think this is the xfactor of the bourne movies his improvisation and situational awareness hes not as hokey as macgyver or as superhuman as bond hes more like sherlock holmes on the run and hell fuck a guy up with just a towel or something
movies,not_removed,if i were that agent id have said sorry maam no can do bourne disarmed me knocked me out and locked me in my own interrogation room before i could blink lock that perimeter down yourself i quit
movies,not_removed,i know its not in this film but i love the scene where he tells noah that if he was really in his office theyd be having that conversation face to face you can feel the cold ice run down noahs spine as the realisation of how fucked he is hits him beautiful
movies,not_removed,if you notice any time he goes into action mode he has the same sense of calm this is meant to show the training hes had under the doctor and neil daniels and how it automatically kicks in when he has to take action hes programmed to do this and its subconscious at this point a good example is in the first movie when the cops wake him up when hes sleeping on the park bench you can see it kick in when he first grabs the cops nightstick
movies,not_removed,i love that ambient sound in scenes when bourne is about to do something awesome its that really soft slightly unnerving hum dont know how else to describe it but i think it works brilliantly its a shame the latest movie was so poor
movies,not_removed,looks like im watching the trilogy today
movies,not_removed,best thing about bourne he doesnt need to make a witty one liner like how bond does
movies,not_removed,that music is so good
movies,not_removed,all that shit landy gives him afterwards about how dangerous he is yeah they should have been telling him that during the first phone call
movies,not_removed,the jason bourne movies are so good the fighting is good and its matt damon brilliant actor
movies,not_removed,fun fact matt damon broke that actors tim griffin nose during filming they practiced in a larger rehearsal space and when they filmed in the much more confined room damon went too hard and knocked him out for real
movies,not_removed,i love these movies so much in who would have thought the kid from good will hunting could be such a badass
movies,not_removed,remember when small phones were the thing
movies,not_removed,this is still my favorite bourne movie i think it has the best pacing and some of the best action in the series
movies,not_removed,if i believe he cloned cards so he hears the exchange between them without risk of someone at the agency recognizing his voice this way he gets to hear the conversation with no fear of suspicion he also has a different phone so it might also be a way of not being tracked if it when the guy revealed his phone had been taken it wouldnt have mattered if hed been detained by way of carrying around fake plates his goal was to send the message of him coming for them his plan was to be detained in the first place
movies,not_removed,i still think supremacy is the best of the trilogy theres only real bourne movies i like how dark it is and how much more control he has of the situation compared the first movie ultimatums plot just kinda felt nonsensical but the action was still good
movies,not_removed,wow whole years and it still holds up
movies,not_removed,love scene so much more though spine chilling for real
movies,not_removed,this is one chilling scene your post makes me want to watch the whole trilogy again but for me the goosebumps come when he says she is standing right next to you fuck
movies,not_removed,that music just makes you wanted to become like jason bourne
movies,not_removed,why does it matter that this movie is years old
movies,not_removed,of course hes calm hes read the script he knows how it turns out
movies,not_removed,shake cam
movies,not_removed,for the upcoming movie trailer i wish they just had that scene with him shirtless and onehitting that guy to the ground and then only showing the text you know his name would have been the best second trailer ever
movies,not_removed,this was a genuinely amazing trilogy truly remarkable
movies,not_removed,the new movie has none of the charisma of this clip
movies,not_removed,ok im not crazy the shaky cam in the new one is not even close to how they use shaky cam in this movie
movies,not_removed,he indeed is a very great actor
movies,not_removed,for some reason i love brian cox in this film hes such a shit especially to landy you say this stuff like you read it in a book
movies,not_removed,shame the new one sucks
movies,not_removed,really good i think my fav was the embassy in the first one where he doesnt even know what hes doing as it happens and now i need to go watch these again
movies,not_removed,i need to watch this movie looks awesome
movies,not_removed,the thing i hate about this scene and these types of movies is the shaky cam i cant watch these scenes very long before i get motion sick
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,that filing cabinet was very conviniently sized to fit under the handle so snuggly like that
movies,not_removed,the sound is ever so slightly off from the lips and it annoys me
movies,not_removed,its a whole twelve years old and it still holds up what the fuck mind blown
movies,not_removed,great movie but this clip just reminded me of how much i hate shaky cam i dont mind it so much during some chaoic sequences but i cant stand the camera shaking when someone is just having a fucking conversation
movies,not_removed,real quick
movies,not_removed,i dont recall the fake license plate on the stolen bmw from earlier viewings i get its a work of fiction but seriously where did he come up with an italian license plate in that time he had it ready to go in his bag
movies,not_removed,i love his characterthats why i am so obsessed with the bourne movies
movies,not_removed,love the bourne trilogy and am so happy the new one came at
movies,not_removed,isnt a langley area code
movies,not_removed,the camera work gave me motion sickness
movies,not_removed,well thats a prefect chest of drawers
movies,not_removed,from bourne identity when hes being chased by the marines in the embassy and grabs the fire escape plan off the wall to make his way out of the building simple but ingenious
movies,not_removed,i love that he never speaks
movies,not_removed,this scene makes the movie for me its so well done
movies,not_removed,sweet he did that thing where he punches someone with a gun knocks them out while disarming them and then points the gun at them at the end but then doesnt shoot them because he doesnt need to saw jason bourne on friday and i nearly cheered when he did the same thing think he does it twice in that one
movies,not_removed,how do you like them apples
movies,not_removed,chills down your spine you should get out more
movies,not_removed,you know what bothers the absolute fuck out of me about this scene is how shakey the fucking camera is it has bothered me about the last born movies not the first one its even kind of made fun of in shawn of the dead why is this still a camera style for movies
movies,not_removed,i am so glad both matt damon and paul greengrass are returning to this franchise﻿
movies,not_removed,and later its still pretty impossible to watch im on the verge of a seizure watching borne movies to many fucking camera cuts there were at least for him plugging in a usb cord
movies,not_removed,watched it last night honestly the shakey cam was never much of an issue and my parents could follow the plot fine without really remembering much about identity
movies,not_removed,man i would have loved the bourne movies if it wasnt for all the shaky cameras always makes me nauseous
movies,not_removed,yeah he is working well there you see his attention change twice once just slightly when the phone rings and a second time during the conversation with langley when his name is mentioned there is no real reason to clone the sim card he could have just taken the phone and impersonated the cia guy when landy called the outcome would have been the same its not clear to me why he had a fake german registration plate in his luggage though its a liability carrying a thing like that across a border what if the italians had gone through his stuff first they would have been certain they had a spook on their hands
movies,not_removed,well he is acting its not real guys
movies,not_removed,maaatt damon
movies,not_removed,what does the movie being years old have anything to do with matt damons performance i hate these posts
movies,not_removed,the scene still gives me motion sickness good ol shaky cam
movies,not_removed,why do people keep upvoting shitty titles it is like every fucking post on this sub follows the same shitty formula
movies,not_removed,that light cabinet isnt stopping anyone
movies,not_removed,just because hes an actor doesnt mean hes not a real lunatic
movies,not_removed,hail corporate
movies,not_removed,its a movie why wouldnt he be calm
movies,not_removed,i wouldnt know i couldnt watch it because of shakeycam bullshit
movies,not_removed,this was the one where the camera men all had parkinsons unwatchable for me
movies,not_removed,yeah i typically sit like that when seated in front of an asshole boss
movies,not_removed,this scene was dumb as fuck im sorry this whole bourne series is overrated as fuck
movies,not_removed,or a pen that fight scene in the first one still makes my skin crawl
movies,not_removed,guys got a knife better roll up this magazine
movies,not_removed,or a book from bourne
movies,not_removed,situational awareness the one scene early in this one i think in the mall how he knew exactly what path to take to avoid being seen lesson one in that scene do what jason bourne tells you
movies,not_removed,toe to toe bourne would absolutely destroy bond
movies,not_removed,theres that one bourne scene where he takes the guy out with a magazinethen uses the magazine to start a fire that blows up his house lol
movies,not_removed,bourne wasnt improving there he was exactly where he wanted to be he needed to find out whos been after him
movies,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqyjucsrrdbk
movies,not_removed,also he was unconscious for a number of minutes thats brain damage territory
movies,not_removed,then the agency has you killed because theyre dickbags
movies,not_removed,i love how he says they down lock down in italy right as he realizes he got locked in
movies,not_removed,or the easy shes standing right next to you classic
movies,not_removed,which latest one the newest one or renner
movies,not_removed,i saw it last night i left feeling like i felt after the latest star wars its like a rehash of the first movie i knew exactly what was going to happen the whole time
movies,not_removed,wow i didnt even notice it until you pointed it out very subtle
movies,not_removed,that helicopterspinning fan sound in ultimatum
movies,not_removed,same thing happens to me i see one clip now i have to see it all
movies,not_removed,i watched the four previous entries in the hours preceding the cinema viewing
movies,not_removed,extreme ways might be the best song to start the credits to in recent memory
movies,not_removed,i didnt realize how culturally impactful they were until i was watching tv with my grandmother and she said oh theyre making another bourne movie i was baffled
movies,not_removed,ben affleck was the bomb in phantoms
movies,not_removed,the fighting wouldve been more enjoyable it they didnt constantly use fast cuts and shaky cams the new one was annoying to watch because of those
movies,not_removed,looks like he just knocked him out no mention of a broken nose the scene where bourne punches the two men at the airport saw him accidentally connect with the actor playing agent nevins tim griffin and actually lay him out when he came around he said did you get in on camera i thought hed of broken his nose or something because it was a hell of a whack but it works made the scene look real
movies,not_removed,i remember people made fun of this movie when the trailers came out i was one of them we all shut up when it opened hell of a movie
movies,not_removed,check him out in courage under fire total different dude
movies,not_removed,but thats pretty much what made the first movie so good at the time you dont expect matt damon to be in that kind of role
movies,not_removed,you mean cell phones
movies,not_removed,new one
movies,not_removed,movies arent video games you know a decade or so wont make it look like it was from a different era altogether besides bourne isnt the kind of film that ages quickly because it doesnt rely too heavily on cgi and nonpractical effects
movies,not_removed,in those years we got youtube fb twitter smarthpones etc a lot has changed since
movies,not_removed,le classic cinema gem
movies,not_removed,there are films from years ago that dont hold up
movies,not_removed,this is the music i put on when i need to write an essay the night before its due
movies,not_removed,to an year old they would have known this movie for as long as they can remember which translates to forever
movies,not_removed,yeah its not like it has a lot of special effects which can appear dated after a decade or so the special effects are the fight and stunt choreography stuff that tends to age better than special effects
movies,not_removed,because i was when i first saw it in theaters with my dad and i was absolutely fucking blown away by how cool it was as a badass spy movie and now as a young adult i still have the same love for the movie but with a totally different type of appreciation
movies,not_removed,not only that but the amounts of cuts for simple scenes around cuts just to change the plate and get inside jesus
movies,not_removed,almost unwatchable in the theater
movies,not_removed,youre in a big puddle of shit pamela and you dont have the shoes for it
movies,not_removed,and the bourne movies are based off books so that line always made me laugh
movies,not_removed,agreed too many drawn out scenes of made up hackertech wumbojumbo
movies,not_removed,dont watch the new one then its disgusting how badly the camera shakes during fight sequences
movies,not_removed,yeah but thats years in time
movies,not_removed,what about the prefix
movies,not_removed,he also steals one of the walkie talkies
movies,not_removed,bourne geez its literally everywhere in this thread
movies,not_removed,id say it was on par with which was a step down from and in my opinion a solid enjoyable action film with a straightforward plot and cool fight scenes the shaky cam was a bit distracting but not nearly as terrible as it was in star trek beyond
movies,not_removed,its like it was edited by a youtube vlogger heyguysimgoingtothemusicfestivalandillbethere
movies,not_removed,hah for some reason i love shaky cams love the frenetic pace it creates
movies,not_removed,the outcome would have been the same no it wouldnt this way they dont know he knows
movies,not_removed,spoilers he got caught intentionally to figure out who was after him this time he also used his old jason bourne passport and was armed knowing it would flag the cia thats why he cloned the sim card as well this was all right after marie got killed and he was looking for revenge
movies,not_removed,i wasnt sure how they managed to cut that many times when just showing a guy putting a plate on
movies,not_removed,not german plate the id clearly says i eu code for italy
movies,not_removed,i feel stupid i thought that about the phone but didnt even blink an eye when he pulled out a fake plate that is mighty strange
movies,not_removed,maybe he just tore it off someone elses car
movies,not_removed,inconsistencies and troubling details in all three damon flicks no blood on victims faces after theyve been thrashed removing the fire escape map off the wall during the us embassy escape scene in identity it was like it simple let taped to the wall and he just lifts it off the wall but i love those movies for their realism and they do it better than almost any other hollywood flicks
movies,not_removed,thats not the pnevermind
movies,not_removed,yeah nah dumb tired old joke for a superb actor
movies,not_removed,it has to do with the fact that even though its years later it still sends chills down ops spine
movies,not_removed,obvious film that everyones grandmother recognizes is so good please upvote me
movies,not_removed,its meant to stop the handle from being turned which would stop the door from being opened
movies,not_removed,the cabinet is to keep the door handle from turning doesnt matter how big it is its just that its the exact height to keep the handle from turning nice planning there cia very considerate
movies,not_removed,it is tall enough that it stops the door handle from being turned
movies,not_removed,its stopping the door handle from going down
movies,not_removed,it turns the stop door from being enough tall
movies,not_removed,these movies are so good with their details that most people dont even see them on first viewing its lost on people like you but im glad a large percentage of people get it so they can keep making movies though the handleturning is a pretty noticeable one try not to think too hard
movies,not_removed,this isnt from identity
movies,not_removed,no it isnt this is after gets killed and he is coming back to find out why they did it in the process he finds out somebody was doing work and linking it to him the first bourne movie is entirely him on the run being attacked by treadstone people
movies,not_removed,uhhave you even seen the movie it pretty much explains why he is that way
movies,not_removed,why is it dumb explain please
movies,not_removed,is my favorite fight scene where someone gets messed up with a pen
movies,not_removed,the fight for those interested
movies,not_removed,the magazine fight was better
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i think youre thinking of the train station in ultimatum i just watched that again and i loved that the cia guys had completely lost the reporter as long as he followed bourne and the second the reporter acts on his own he pops up on their screens again like if he had listened to instructions he would have been fine but he acted on his own and it got him killed
movies,not_removed,not only that you can see that he constantly remembers and applies his training lesser people would be more arrogant trust their intelligence and improvise more but he is constantly prepared for a situation he enters into and you can see that he almost follows a script in this clip its copy field agents simcard to get to know whos following him take his keys to get a getaway car and his gun for emergencies make sure the agent can leave the room and then be patient he is great at improvising but when he chooses to enter a situation hes almost untouchable as he constantly is four steps ahead of everyone else
movies,not_removed,bourne would be a great dota teammate
movies,not_removed,speaking of bond i read somewhere that the bourne movies heavily influence the franchise to make bond more realistic and gritty hence casino royale i do recall early reviews of bourne identity praising it for being a realistic bond movie
movies,not_removed,now i want a bond vs bourne movie with matt damon and daniel craig
movies,not_removed,not even bourne can penetrate bonds plot armor
movies,not_removed,the new jb movie sucks the hacking scenes are lazy and unrealistic jb relies too much on help and hes more emotional the whole movie is hokey and lazy its sad the only real glimpse of who jb is was at the last scene
movies,not_removed,i just love how shane black plays with cliches and tropes like that
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,no its not if there is one thing that movies and tv have taught me it is that you can easily knock someone out and when they wake up they will be sleepy but ultimately fine
movies,not_removed,its like super bad for you
movies,not_removed,naah in the movies a swift chop to the back of the head results in minutes of deep sleep followed by seconds of grogginess followed by a complete recovery and functionality
movies,not_removed,honestly just the action of being knocked out is brain damage territory
movies,not_removed,get some rest pam you look tired
movies,not_removed,then this plays
movies,not_removed,thew newest one
movies,not_removed,i would have settled for a rehash this latest one felt like poor imitation i never felt tension anywhere close to this scene there was none of the subtlety or the slow careful buildup to a crescendo of action
movies,not_removed,can you point it out in the video i feel like im missing something
movies,not_removed,which part
movies,not_removed,the latest version is on spotify and is brilliant
movies,not_removed,my grandma used to watch tmz so she had a surprising amount of hidden pop culture knowledge
movies,not_removed,be thankful shes still on the ball instead of calling you by the wrong name and the owner of that name died before you were born and asking if those are new slacks ten times
movies,not_removed,kewl
movies,not_removed,snoogins
movies,not_removed,yeah i wanted to say this to my friends after the showing but didnt want to sound like an old man i get that theyre trying to go for a certain feeling but this is an action film right shouldnt the action be fun to watch and not nauseating now ill take my heart medicine and take a nap
movies,not_removed,awh shit thats what i didnt like about supremacy it baffles me why they went that way usually thats reserved for actors who cant fight but damon fights really well on screen as evidences by the other bourne movies
movies,not_removed,anyone downvoting you hasnt seen the movie the cuts make it practically unwatchable combined with the shaky cam every time there is a cut youre so disoriented it takes you a moment to figure out where you are theres one part in the movie where the camera is showing you what is on bournes phone except its swaying all over the place and blurry it only comes into focus for a quarter of a second before it cuts away do you want us to read whats on the phone or not
movies,not_removed,i stand corrected thanks for pointing it out
movies,not_removed,yeah both ben and matt caused outrage for roles they ended up being perfect for
movies,not_removed,because httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcduqreiwek was absolutely awful
movies,not_removed,more recently larger cell phone designs have been trendy see every major manufacturer made a phone
movies,not_removed,heard its not good too much generic action movie and he relies on others which is way out of character for bourne
movies,not_removed,bruv im quite sure he was being sarcastic
movies,not_removed,not really sure why this got downvoted seems like a relatively descriptive response
movies,not_removed,i find that assaulting the professor with rolled up course materials and stabbing him with a pen may have detrimental effects on your grade
movies,not_removed,yeah im reflecting back on jason bourne and lack of the asskicking bourne theme or whatever is playing during this scene for most of the film didnt help the kind of ultimate crescendo of the bourne music to me is its ratcheting intensity in the rooftop chase in bourne ultimatum then you notice it stops completely as soon as bourne breaks through the window to save nicki has a real visceral effect on processing the intensity of that scene possibly the best chase in the franchise
movies,not_removed,thats not real either
movies,not_removed,this i cant stand the shaky camera and fast editing when hes fighting compare it to and tell me whats more fun to watch
movies,not_removed,i agree it adds to the experience but i physically cant watch it for more than five minutes at a time i guess im just really sensitive
movies,not_removed,yes thats a fair point
movies,not_removed,yep that whole scene and his motivation was about him get inside their communications without them realizing he didnt screw up he got caught at a small border crossing with just some novice cia point guy on a saturday night he set them up
movies,not_removed,and was armed i had the impression he stole the field agents gun he was looking for revenge though he could have hunted down kirill in goa but then it would have been a really short movie
movies,not_removed,yes i realized my mistake a minute ago thanks for pointing that out
movies,not_removed,even though the shining is years old it still sends shivers down my spine do you see how completely irrelevant that is if its a good movie its a good movie it doesnt matter how long ago it came out this sub is littered with these bullshit posts
movies,not_removed,shouldnt he be able to turn the handle the other way upwards instead of down most doorhandles allow for both directions
movies,not_removed,nothing special
movies,not_removed,is that benny the jet
movies,not_removed,is mine its a pencil but still p
movies,not_removed,spoon and butter knife
movies,not_removed,it really bothers me that they both just ignore the gun on the floor
movies,not_removed,this war on drugs is getting out of hand
movies,not_removed,yeah but there it practically just the coup de gras in bourne he ducks the dude up six ways from sunday with that thing
movies,not_removed,we talking pens one spring to mind for me
movies,not_removed,it really bothers me that they both just ignore the gun on the floor
movies,not_removed,it really bothers me that they both just ignore the gun on the floor
movies,not_removed,im glad hollywood punches have a changed sound for hits and such these seem obviously forced in retrospection
movies,not_removed,i loved this scene when i first saw it but watching it now the combat foley is hilariously bad
movies,not_removed,thats the one been a while since seeing it
movies,not_removed,not only that you can see that he constantly remembers and applies his training heh this was the coolest thing to me for a guy with severe amnesia he sure remembered his training extremely well the whole amnesia plot device was not just the point of the movie it doubled as a way to let you know just how well trained jb is
movies,not_removed,i do recall early reviews of bourne identity praising it for being a realistic bond movie which honestly i sorta see when you compare it to cheesy bond movies prior to when that movie was released but identity is honestly a lot less realistic than the second and third bourne films the fights are a bit more hokey and then at the end bourne falls from the top of an apartment riding a dead body headshots a guy on the way down and lands and survives
movies,not_removed,even more influential on modern bond were the austin powers movies they did such a good job parodying the campiness of the old bond flicks that the new ones had to be on the complete opposite end of the spectrum – serious dramatic gritty
movies,not_removed,quantum of solace definitely took cues from bourne feels like something straight out of a greengrass movie thematically the whole track his movements freeze all passports thing was also definitely popularized by bourne and later brought into bond before bourne i dont remember many movies that had a government agent on the run from the government
movies,not_removed,at the end of the day bond is supposed to be a spy and even though craigs bond fights a lot more its not his job bourne is a trained assassin who shits on other trained assassins regularly
movies,not_removed,yeah i was pretty disappointed too had a friend that was interested in seeing it and i suggested he wait until its out on video the camera zoom thing was really overdone and i found i started noticing it and it took me out of the movie the fight scenes easily the best part of the bourne series imo were really badly done the improvisation wasnt there it seemed to go out of its way to set up a mystery in the beginning to try to get the audience to care about what was going on like it felt like amateur writing it was just meh overall
movies,not_removed,i dont get why people complain about unrealistic hacking in movies do you really want to sit there forever or pause the flow of action in a movie while the character uses a program or whatever to try and hack a computer if it was realistic then it would take too long and just make no sense meanwhile bourne and many others can knock someone unconcious with one punch and that is somehow realistic
movies,not_removed,im glad i read this thats now how i want to remember jason
movies,not_removed,not to mention an even more robotic performance from vikander in this film than she ever did in ex machina seriously she was more human as a robot in that film than in this one heather lee hack this thing beep boop yes sir hacking beep boop
movies,not_removed,its hours of nonstop shakycam the camera doesnt even stay still in dialogue scenes
movies,not_removed,i thought jb meant james bond i was trying to figure out how you went from bourne to iron man to james bond whoosh sad to hear this though i have fond memories of damon as bourne
movies,not_removed,i read this as james bond
movies,not_removed,and hes more emotional hes got a really good reason to be so emotional in this movie though so it doesnt bother me
movies,not_removed,hes more emotional ive not watched it yet but isnt the point that he is discovering who he was before becoming a tredstone agent so undoing his programming it makes sense that he is more emotional than in the first couple
movies,not_removed,is it out already
movies,not_removed,personally speaking i thought it was a good movie remember bourne said himself that hes been off the grid his latest movie is set years after his previous movie and hes been out of touch
movies,not_removed,this comes up in the jack reacher novels a few times reacher explains after knocking someone out cold to buddy of ko guy that theyre going to feel like shit for a few days not like movies where they pop back up after they wake up
movies,not_removed,i like your username
movies,not_removed,no you get like freebies
movies,not_removed,judo chop
movies,not_removed,extreme ways begins playing
movies,not_removed,thats after the get some rest pam you look tired
movies,not_removed,is it worse than the renner one
movies,not_removed,its bad thats a shame
movies,not_removed,theres a very subtle build hum that builds up when the agent is talking to pamela if listen during the quiet moments before borne acts its not completely silent theres a hum
movies,not_removed,neal daniels office humming fan then helicopter rotors
movies,not_removed,what til that exists awesome
movies,not_removed,haha my grandmother calls everyone all the names she knows has been for all my life
movies,not_removed,smoochie bootchie
movies,not_removed,the get everyone to the basement scene in identity shows how calm he is under pressure looking for the shotgun after finding the shells perfect
movies,not_removed,fight scenes were imho in the top of all films ever fight scenes were imho shaky unclear hard to follow and sloppy i just cant agree and fight scenes got so much more brutal and almost grownup that fights come off really hokey to me i mean come on assassin needs to kill bourne so he rappels down smashing through a window while wildly firing an automatic submachine gun the pen thing was cool and the punches landed but it wasnt as good i do prefer less shaky camerawork but supremacy and ultimatums fights are great
movies,not_removed,i get it everyone is now a fan of greengrass but doug limans editing is better nope i love the bourne identity and i wish i could even like the other two movies because i love the whole superspy genre even the shittiest bond movies are enjoyable but i find the greengrass bourne movies just impossible to rewatch i get the shakycam is supposed to show the tension and whatever but its just distracting and when action occursit just makes me think of all those shitty youtube videos filmed vertically where you cant clearly see anything going on you just get glimpses of whats happening i thought people hated that style of filming
movies,not_removed,the new jb movie makes me hate greengrass
movies,not_removed,totally agree with you i really dislike the fight scenes in
movies,not_removed,sure but its also a thriller the whole trilogy is about finding who he is its supposed to be nauseating for instance id be more inclined to agree if the expendables employed a whole bunch of shaky cam
movies,not_removed,its basically because thats paul greengrass style its just his thing
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,its even in this clip look how goddamn ridiculous the editing is while hes grabbing the sim card and all that
movies,not_removed,im not a huge fan of shaky cam or quick cuts myselfbut i think its done to sort of add to the chaos in the moment factor and to add that extra element of confusion as he tries to piece things together all the time thats my best guess but i agree with you i enjoy the movies but hate those techniques alternative theory michael jay fox is their cameraman
movies,not_removed,oh wow that is really bad
movies,not_removed,jesus its worse than i remember it couldnt get any cornier
movies,not_removed,dont think ive ever seen that quite a few bits werent in the released film too
movies,not_removed,i dont think people even use cell phones anymore cell phone smartphone
movies,not_removed,its not as good as supremacy but its still light years ahead of every other action movie out there
movies,not_removed,dang jason bourne sounds worse and worse by the minute
movies,not_removed,if she had just left the table after exchanging the phone with desh there wouldnt have been a need to save her that gets me yelling every time i see that scene
movies,not_removed,i like this scene because of the music and the chase
movies,not_removed,my attempt at a joke
movies,not_removed,and thats the real point in general bourne always has a way out a new way to obtain information if he can do something properly he always does what if there was a duress code check or something or if local called before langley and knew the agent personally bourne didnt know who would be calling or specifically why he put himself in the best position to gain information no matter what and to add to this many times he gains information without anyone knowing what he gained like calling the hotel room the same time he asked the hotel person to call the room he got the room number and pam didnt know some mysterious person was inquiring it allows him to stay one step ahead this was underrated in jason bourne that because of technology he cant use all of his old tricks as well as he used to they knew he was viewing the files but he couldnt understand how and thats why things went to shit more often in jb people have been criticizing it for being less bourne but hes struggling to keep up with the times i think the notfacebook storyline is going to be huge if they make a new trilogy they were just testing the waters to see if people would watch a new trilogy and i hope ticket sales are encouraging them to if you look at the original trilogy the first one was moreorless standalone and then the next had the same russian baddie same cox story same many things whereas coopers character was killed off at the end of the first one if they make a and my bet is that it will be a huge returntoform with gilroy returning and the focus will be on privacy and how bad it is for the people and how hard it makes life for bourne hell have his own reason to stop heather who you notice is cyber security but it will also benefit the people kalloors riz ahmed is becoming a big actor with nightcrawler and the night of being critically acclaimed theyre not going to waste him tldr theyre going to make more awesome bournes and technology and privacy will be the focus
movies,not_removed,no problem and for everybody else that blue space on the left on euro plates gives country code so you can tell where its from
movies,not_removed,im not sure how to help
movies,not_removed,actually it depends most residential handles will retract the strike mechanism either way although many handles have specific functions depending upon which direction they are turned for some an upward turn will actually engage the locking mechanism
movies,not_removed,yes and no benny the jet reference is complete without his epic jackie chan fight from wheels on meals
movies,not_removed,thought you were talking about the character from the sandlot until i saw uthecandelabras post
movies,not_removed,i love this movie
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,did did jason statham just block a punch with a headbutt edit and then he blocks two more with his face
movies,not_removed,for real his hand even knocks into it at one point
movies,not_removed,definitely the whole wooshcrack takes away from the fight
movies,not_removed,i couldnt take the scene seriously with those sound effects
movies,not_removed,i actually thought the fighting was pretty good just the generic punchingwoosh sound takes away from it edit i dont know what foley is in filmmaking
movies,not_removed,i think the idea of jb not knowing who he is is a reference to the cold war ideas about depatterning and psychic driving see mk ultra and ewen cameron the idea is that you would then be training an empty vessel that it allows for no moral compunctions a mind that is only training and purpose
movies,not_removed,more like the opposite end of the spectreum
movies,not_removed,very true i think bourne would win although craig is much better at fighting than brosnans bond ever was
movies,not_removed,i could see bourne winning the fights but bond winning the war either way id watch the hell out of that movie
movies,not_removed,i found the movie to be exactly what i would expect a bourne movie to be set years after his last one it had the same feel the same intrigue and the same type of action as his other movies remember this jason bourne is older and has been off the grid for years i think the movie did a good job of displaying a government agent that has been out of touch for years the suddenly thrown back into the thick of things
movies,not_removed,i thought the fight scenes were ok but ffs the car chase scenes were so fucking over the top when you go back and watch the car chase scene in the first bourne and compare it to the cheese in this last one you just want to politely ask for your money back and walk away like bourne does after kicking ass
movies,not_removed,i was also disappointed by the lack of improvisation and general situational awareness from bourne that had pretty much been a staple of the franchise and something that elevated it above other action films there were a few times where i got some classic bourne vibes like the whole scene in london or when he nicks a rioters molotov as hes about to throw it in order to create an obstacle but overall there was nothing that came even close to what weve seen in other films like the waterloo scene in ultimatum where you actually get to see his ability to think on his feet and improvise when the plan falls apart or even the sequence in supremacy where he tracks down pam by using his wits in jason bourne however it felt as if the people behind the fillm couldnt figure out how to portray this in a satisfying way and instead came up with lazy solutions the worst offender for this was the vegas scene where he literally has every gadget he needs conveniently lined up on a table
movies,not_removed,i understand that actual hacking is let anything like what weve seen in movies and shows but the disappointment comes from the fact that they chose hollywoodhacking in the first place why not advance the plot in pretty much any other way and not make the entire thing silly one of the aspects of jb movies in the past has been how real they try to make these sub government agencies their programs tactics precision seem like they could exist they undo all of that with enhance and use sql to corrupt the database pseudo hacks
movies,not_removed,they actually used a real hack in matrix reloaded in a blink and youll miss it sort of way there isnt a need to even go into details really just make the dialog not be stupid boss can you hack into their system hacker guy it looks like theyre running and older version of boss can you get in hacker guy give me a second ok im in thats all you need you dont even need to say what software theyre running no details are better than wrong details corrupt their database using sql gives a wrong detail where no details are needed
movies,not_removed,people that complain about unrealistic hacking have no fucking clue how boring hacking actually is and glorify it to some extreme level its like how action movies often make automatic guns fire bullets when they only actually have a round mag that empties in a few seconds and then need to be reloadednobody wants that representation in a movie they want the entertaining representation
movies,not_removed,nah man they want realistic hacking like
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,there are literally hundreds of videos of people dropping unconscious after being hit on the head once
movies,not_removed,jason bourne is americas james bond
movies,not_removed,breeeeee breeeeeee
movies,not_removed,supremacys was always my favorite instance of this ending its done so well
movies,not_removed,extreme ways are back again extreme places i dont know♫
movies,not_removed,moby has some sick tracks for sure that gone in seconds sountrack called flower is a classic too
movies,not_removed,here you go
movies,not_removed,it might just be legacy at least innovated a little on the theme the newest is almost a direct clone of supremacy
movies,not_removed,definitely not i actually enjoyed the new one not as good as the first but certainly better than the renner one the new ones story was lacking you didnt really feel as engaged to the story so it felt like you were watching a movie unlike the first trilogy which really immersed you but bourne still does badass things and the action scenes are terrific too many movie cliches came up in the film but at least they pulled them off entertainingly all in all a fun summer flick but not exactly a memorable bourne film like the first movies but definitely worth a watch
movies,not_removed,id say legacy is better in terms of story but having matt damon in this one obviously skews some of the perception despite having an awful story
movies,not_removed,i saw it yesterday and while its definitely not up to par of the previous it still delivered the actionthrills and suspense aside from one death you knew was coming from a mile away in the beginning of the movie you expect from a bourne movie if youre a fan of the franchise you should enjoy it if its going to be your first bourne movie i wouldnt recommend it
movies,not_removed,wouldnt say its bad from an action movie perspective but from what the trilogy put forth yeah its not really like it theres really no plot or narrative in the new moviethat really follows from the trilogy that has that much precedence dont want to spoil anything you get very little details about jason bourne the whole movie is just action and some car chases i came out going well it wasnt terrible but it wasnt good either
movies,not_removed,its not as good as the first three but still good
movies,not_removed,same here
movies,not_removed,people hate that style of filmmaking except if the name paul greengrass is attached to the film seriously taken action scenes were more coherent than the action in greengrass bourne movies and im not exaggerating
movies,not_removed,extremely overdramatic while i would say maybe of just the action scenes might have shots that are a bit too wild in an unnecessary way but in the majority of the shots you have a clear understanding of whats going on
movies,not_removed,i would say its like squares and rectangles all squares are rectangles not all rectangles are squares all smartphones are cell phones not all cell phones are smart phones
movies,not_removed,youre wrong
movies,not_removed,christ its really not that bad at all really good action flick not perfect but well worth seeing
movies,not_removed,i think youve done enough hes too far gone i understand what youre saying if that makes you feel better
movies,not_removed,he iswas john cusacks friendtrainer for years prior to the making of grosse pointe blank cusack even name drops him in say anything when his character his talking about wanting to be a kickboxer
movies,not_removed,or reading about his actual real lift accomplishments dude was a monster in the ring
movies,not_removed,and the swink sounds as a blade is swung through the air wut
movies,not_removed,it sounded like someone redubbed it and uploaded it to make it funny
movies,not_removed,he was pretty good in goldeneye odd thing goldeneye is one of the best bond films but the later brosnan ones especially the last are the worst of the bunch
movies,not_removed,if you lose a fight to bourne youre dead he wouldnt let someone like bond escape if he already had him beat
movies,not_removed,completely agree it was nice to see a return to a true bourne feeling after legacy but it obviously has flaws and i definitely understand some of the complaints that i see in this thread i still loved it though and will no doubt get the bluray once it comes out
movies,not_removed,if the first car scenes had a guy in an armored car like this one did im pretty sure they wouldnt worry about dodging cars too
movies,not_removed,the worst offender for this was the vegas scene where he literally has every gadget he needs conveniently lined up on a table at least now we finally know who agent is
movies,not_removed,yea i suppose that is true the original trilogy you could expect good writing but this is the movie so chances are they couldnt get as good a screenwriter not sure on that just a guess its clearly a cash grab with less quality then the original trilogy
movies,not_removed,corrupt their database using sql i heard that line too and flinched some writer somewhere went what are words that geeks use ahhhh perfect
movies,not_removed,tell that to the movie heat val kilmers mag change was amazing
movies,not_removed,the problem isnt just that the hacking was bad but it was like ncislevel bad
movies,not_removed,yea mostly drunk teenagers who barely know how to fight not trained guards my point is the fights and gunplay are not super realistic so the rest isnt that much of a stretch like the hacking
movies,not_removed,just started my bourne marathon to prepare for the new one forgot how much i love that ending to every movie
movies,not_removed,dont worry seen these films enough time to recite most of it
movies,not_removed,it actually came from a number of miles away but i loved that setup it gave you a number of reasons showing that his character was on bourne level i dont get the hate for that movie why not have a few rogues running around it shows that these govt agencies are fallible i think renner did a great job fulfilling the role i also like how they sort of mirrored the first movie but yet the plot wasnt the same really just the flow
movies,not_removed,actually id say the reverse for someone who really enjoyed the original this one disappointed i wouldnt recommend it to bourne fans as a general action movie for someone who doesnt care it was fine
movies,not_removed,if you are at all a fan of the original the new one will disappoint it was closer to bourne guest starring on ncis than a good spy flick
movies,not_removed,hows it overdramatic if its my opinion i find the shakycam incredibly distracting and it massively takes away my ability to enjoy the film not for motion sickness or anything it just annoys the shit out of me because every time the cameras going apeshit i just think boy itd be real nice to just be able to tell whats going on here
movies,not_removed,have you seen the moon even though it came out years ago sam rockwell still fuck my mind
movies,not_removed,his fight record on wikipedia is basically a wall of green and a single red line for a muay thai fight that is shrouded in controversy
movies,not_removed,that one is great too possibly better i fucking love the way yuen wah hams it up with the cigar
movies,not_removed,early action movies man
movies,not_removed,whoops i completely misread that thanks i wouldnt have even known i was in the wrong
movies,not_removed,i dont think the late brosnan ones are worse than some of the shite that went down in the moore era
movies,not_removed,none of them compare to the shit show that was live and let die with roger moore holy crap that movie was horrible
movies,not_removed,not so odd really if you watch any set of bond films under a specific actor they get more hokey as they go even the craig ones got hokier ending with spectre feeling too much like the same old hokeyness we thought wed finally gotten away from the first bond film with a new lead always needs to deliver an impact to get people over the hump of but i really loved the last guy pierce brosnan was a fantastic bond it was the scripts that were shit then of course theres timothy dalton who played an angry vicious gritty bond long before craig came along but people back then werent ready for it it was late early and a lot of the movies and television back then were testing the limits of the audience to tolerate more violence and grit people decided they werent ready for a dark brooding bond just yet personally i love the dalton bond movies and wish there were more of them
movies,not_removed,theres more than one way to lose a fight outmaneuvering a stronger better opponent to a place where you can escape is a loss just as getting killed by him is
movies,not_removed,the big bad got killed by brian cox in both identity and supremacy after bourne walked away when he already had them beat
movies,not_removed,enhance that
movies,not_removed,its a movie mate
movies,not_removed,do yourself a favor and read the novels someday completely different but good stuff all the same one of the few bookmovies that i can say both were good
movies,not_removed,one thing i loved about the old movies was that the ending of the second film actually took place midway through the third
movies,not_removed,they changed it up a significant amount in the new movie but it is still recognizable
movies,not_removed,i dislike the move fir the sheer amount of deus ex machina involved at every stage everything just falls into bournes lap the motorcycle fight was bad ass tho
movies,not_removed,hows this for a stupid response
movies,not_removed,yuen biao sir unless wah is some nickname hes got that im unfamiliar with
movies,not_removed,i dont care how campy moores movies were brosnan ended up fighting a korean who somehow had himself genetically modified into a pasty white british man who came out of nowhere and managed to build a giant laser canon in space without anyone blinking an eye his henchman was an albino with tiny diamonds embedded in his skin who refused to have them removed for some reason bond drove an invisible car and surfed a tidal wave
movies,not_removed,i love the dalton bond movies and wish there were more of them amen brother he was really good better than brosnan
movies,not_removed,its a movie mate exactly it shouldnt take its hacking from ncis
movies,not_removed,it always bothered me a bit that they reshot the you look tired scene and didnt keep it consistent
movies,not_removed,ah reread it im so used to complaints about legacy that i read it that way havent seen the new one yet
movies,not_removed,yuen biao is the other good guy the one who gets his throat kicked in by benny yuen wah is the criminal mastermind running the drug empire this guy
movies,not_removed,different flavours of bad i suppose
movies,not_removed,ahhhhhh deepest apologies mate
movies,not_removed,honestly i got mine at target or walmart i dont have any i prefer and for variety but all of those have worked well for me i also he purchased frames off amazon for other posters that have worked really well
movies,not_removed,michaels sells onesheet sized frames that are in the range just basic black plastic nothing fancy but they look fine and work pretty well with everything sometimes theyll do off sales at which point theyre super reasonable ive got like frames and a bunch of old posters i just rotate out from time to time
movies,not_removed,i honestly grab all mine for all the unique posters i buy at shows from walmart i have a signed one from the band moe that i put in one and it cost me for a and they have bigger ones of decent quality
movies,not_removed,httpwwwdickblickcomcategoriesposterframes has great frames
movies,not_removed,ive had trouble with the cheaper frames like youve posted their dimensions arent always exact and the standard onesheet dimensions are not and id wind up with ripples in the poster as a result you can mount the poster on backing board to prevent that but i have no experience with mounting so cant say how easyhard it is for all of my posters i like the httpwwwframeusacommetalframesuframekitipictureframes reasonably priced and they have archival options for glass and backing acidfree backing uv plexiglass and the posters always fit great
movies,not_removed,i would probably just buy something online i feel like is an odd size i am still hunting around frame for a print that i bought
movies,not_removed,cool
movies,not_removed,i see
movies,not_removed,not a bad thought to carry
movies,not_removed,oh yeah i forgot about this site
movies,not_removed,sounds interesting i should look at these
movies,not_removed,is not an odd size it is the standard sized theatrical movie poster for decades upon decades and as such you can find them just about anywhere that deals in frames theyre not cheap but i have dozens of them theyre not hard to find or in any way unusual
movies,not_removed,true
movies,not_removed,ah i thought was the standard theatrical size
movies,not_removed,green room zootopia finding dory star trek beyond looking forward to lbj morgan girl on the train
movies,not_removed,the best movies of the year so far imo are cloverfield lane the jungle book the nice guys xmen apocalypse civil war and jason bourne the movies im looking forward to are la la land rogue one the accountant the founder moana assassins creed morgan and the girl on the train
movies,not_removed,it hurts me how unknown swiss army man is that movie was not what i expected at all and yet it was better than anything i could have imagined my absolute favourite for the year
movies,not_removed,deadpool and zootopia were the best so far looking forward to rogue one
movies,not_removed,here are my top ten favorite movies of the year so far in alphabetical order cloverfield lane captain america civil war deadpool finding dory green room hail caesar the jungle book star trek beyond the witch zootopia here are some movies that im looking forward to a monster calls the accountant assassins creed doctor strange fantastic beasts and where to find them the magnificent seven miss peregines home for peculiar children rogue one snowden suicide squad
movies,not_removed,so far cloverfield lane zootopia the fundamentals of caring the nice guys looking forward to hacksaw ridge snowden silence rogue one the birth of a nation the founder
movies,not_removed,i agree the stakes were quite low but the action was so awesome that i could forgive the low stakes also i just like watching matt damon beating people up
movies,not_removed,i watched sing street last night probably the best film ive seen this year
movies,not_removed,the lobster was so amazing and i really cant wait for american honey
movies,not_removed,green room is a beast of a movie
movies,not_removed,i need to see the green room thought it came out last year
movies,not_removed,i second green room
movies,not_removed,honestly was disappointed with jason borne the action was great but they story did not make me care
movies,not_removed,ive been waiting to see this captain fantastic and hunter for the wilderpeople for a while now they all have gotten amazing reviews and people are saying they are some of the best movies in their genres cant wait to see all
movies,not_removed,wish i couldve found a theater playing it tension was present throughout the whole thing looking forward to the directors future projects blue ruin from him is great too
movies,not_removed,came out in the us at least its at redbox i believe
movies,not_removed,when it was revealed what the whole story was about i felt that was it the stakes felt so low i didnt care
movies,not_removed,i totally agree i feel like his emotions and the plotstory line didnt quite finish i was waiting for more but the action was awesome
movies,not_removed,i agree blue ruin comes to amazon prime august too
movies,not_removed,i didnt realize this was the same guy that made murder party until yesterday this guy is fantastic
movies,not_removed,ive heard great things about that one too
movies,not_removed,my friend just stumbled on it at a blockbuster a few years ago and it was damn good
movies,not_removed,one of my favorites from childhood i still love it
movies,not_removed,this is everything
movies,not_removed,side note thrice covered this song and it is amazazing
movies,not_removed,i think it could be the best movie everi dont like the last part because logan is not the part but only for minutes which i dont like and i think it could be the end of xmen series
movies,not_removed,no do not take the kids it is one of the worst xmen movies dont start them off with this one also its the bloodiest xmen movie so far
movies,not_removed,kind of yeah you will miss out on getting nearly all of the arcs between characters though which makes up a good portion of the movie thats not related to apocalypse my suggestion make a family deal out of the whole thing watch xmen first class and xmen days of future past on dvdbluraynetflix or something on fridaysaturday night then xmen apocalypse at the cinema it will also mean you can save a ticket if your kids are shit and dont like the first two p
movies,not_removed,i havent seen it yet so im not the best judge but based on the mediocre reviews and the weird time jumps from movie to movie i wouldnt start them on this one
movies,not_removed,i prefer xmen and xmen over any of these prequel movies you would be better off starting with these imo also apocalypse was pretty violent almost surprising it got level of violence but it only had one f bomb so its okay
movies,not_removed,worst comment ever
movies,not_removed,hope you enjoyed your weekend
movies,not_removed,did you see the sequel cry wolf cry
movies,not_removed,i will have a small amount of hatred for sony for the rest of my life due to the way they handled this franchise after the second one i just still cant believe after the second they felt a need to step in there was no need the second one was better and made more money but they felt they had to step in
movies,not_removed,i wonder if he sneaks into theaters to watch the new spiderman movies
movies,not_removed,wow havent seen many tobey interviews but he seems really nice
movies,not_removed,having heard what he said about working with sam raimi id love to see them partner up again
movies,not_removed,tobey was the best spiderman
movies,not_removed,i still think spiderman and spiderman are easily the best out of all of the films they have come out with so far rami basically templated the origin story with his first spidey film many other films had attempted to get that across but none were as successful as spiderman you can see many superhero films used this idea in a vast majority of their films post spiderman the reason i like rami and maguires spidermanpeter parker so much is because he is the one with the most to lose as another poster put it garfield and now holland really have everything going for them in a sense while maguires parker could have lost everything based on the reveal of him being spiderman which is why im not a big fan of spidey in civil war mcu hes a kid and really has nothing to lose at this point thats what made spideyparker such a pivotal point in the comics he had the most to lose from the superhero registration act i just wish civil war had the unmasking scene from the comic and it was revealed that spidey was in fact still maguire an older peter parker with very established enemies who would jump at the chance to hurt him where it hurts most
movies,not_removed,if anyone is remotely interested in a download link below is a pdf of spiderman treatment by raimi super condensed scene byscene breakdown i havent indulged in it myself but if any of you are interested bon appétit
movies,not_removed,i think its funny how with all of the miscasting and changes in archetype all the adaptailtions fans lose their shit over and the all actors the prematurely shit on the one consistency is spider man tobey andrew and tom are all great as the character
movies,not_removed,flaws and all the third film nonetheless suggested that there were still lots of things that you could do with the franchise so its a damn shame they didnt continue
movies,not_removed,tobey sounds like jeff from american dad
movies,not_removed,am i the only one that likes spiderman and for some reason bores the hell out of me idk why
movies,not_removed,i grew up with the og spidey movies so it makes sense that i have an emotional attachment to them dont get me wrong marvel is doing well in its own respect and i know this has been said a million times but their films lack a certain factor that makes for a satisfying movie experience ie they are not very surprising and feel too much of the same too linear thats why i enjoyed bvs and the newer xmen flicks so much because the plot goes in new directions and the film explores certain areas that marvel flicks fail to do even the og spidey trilogy did that offered a huge world and explored many areas in a rather unpredictable fashion or maybe i was just a kid and everything was unpredictable to me in any case tobey is the og
movies,not_removed,kids these days wont know who the real spiderman is﻿
movies,not_removed,it would be very cool if in the new spiderman movie tobey and andrew make a cameo in a scene together﻿
movies,not_removed,is that the real toby maguire in the youtube comments
movies,not_removed,spiderman had so much promise john malkovich as the vulture wouldve been perfect
movies,not_removed,original spiderman movies are so amazing sad we couldnt have seen more
movies,not_removed,lol the person who uploaded this is impersonating tobey maguire
movies,not_removed,man he really doesnt want to be talking about spiderman
movies,not_removed,he already knew it was over
movies,not_removed,i remember waiting and waiting for a spiderman trailer everyone was talking about how carnage will be in it
movies,not_removed,wow to be honest toby and tom holland sound similar just natural speaking
movies,not_removed,hed make a good cousin kelly on always sunny
movies,not_removed,good ol tugboat maguire
movies,not_removed,he knew
movies,not_removed,best peter worst spider
movies,not_removed,i skipped to random points in this video and in each snippet tobey said fun at least once i bet spiderman would have been super fun
movies,not_removed,and tldw for those of us who dont want to hear tobey talk
movies,not_removed,tobey was horrible in these movies and the movies themselves have not aged well edit bring on the downvotes you are all losers for liking raimi sm and mcguire
movies,not_removed,shit actor
movies,not_removed,and we got goddamn eric foreman as eddie brock fuck right off that shit made me so mad however we did get the pie scene out of it i was absolutely floored when i saw that in the theater loved it immensely
movies,not_removed,the first and second were good films but the third one damn pure shite
movies,not_removed,i think its funny that sony tried to take creative control away from raimi but marvel studios entire business is built around his approach to spiderman the visual style the action the tone even the music and now marvel is making spiderman movies itd be poetic justice if marvel actually acknowledged that their films owe everything to raimi and they just copied his success
movies,not_removed,and thats like the hollywood version of facebook stalking your ex
movies,not_removed,he complimented the recent spiderman in civil war so i think he has no hard feelings
movies,not_removed,i hope so i sure as hell regret paying money for the amazing spiderman
movies,not_removed,if you like tobey watch the spoils of babylon like right now heres a httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvvkmbopgvom
movies,not_removed,i remember jason mewes saying that tobey and his entourage used to be quite a rowdy bunch in la i wonder what that was about
movies,not_removed,this has been my favorite interview of his cant help but laugh along with him
movies,not_removed,ive heard mixed things about him though
movies,not_removed,other actors directors and such speak well of him
movies,not_removed,i was thinking the same seems like an incredibly rational and realistic person
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,thats not what these fuckers say httpwwwpajibacomcelebritiesarebetterthanyoutobeymaguiremaybeapsychoticdouchephp edit here is the story so you dont have to click you have to cut jamie off you know i know i said counting tobeys chips he held a thousanddollar chip in his hand he flipped it over a couple times in his fingers this is yours he said holding it out thanks tobey i said reaching my hand out he yanked the chip back at the last second if he said if you do something to earn these thousand dollars his voice was loud enough that some of the guys looked up to see what was happening i laughed trying not to show my nerves what do i want you to do he said as if he were pondering the whole table was watching us now i know he said get up on that desk and bark like a seal i looked at him his face was lit up like it was christmas eve bark like a seal who wants a fish he said i laughed again stalling hoping he would play the joke out by himself and leave im not kidding whats wrong youre too rich now you wont bark for a thousand dollars wowwww you must be really rich my face was burning the room was silent cmon he said holding the chip above my head bark no i said quietly no he asked tobey i said im not going to bark like a seal keep your chip my face was on fire i knew he would be angry especially because he had now engaged the whole audience and i wasnt playing his game i was embarrassed but i was also angry after all i had done to accommodate this guy i was also shocked i had made sure i ran every detail of every game by him changed the stakes for him structured tournaments around him memorized every ingredient in every vegan dish in town for him he had won millions and millions of dollars at my table and i had catered to his every need along the way—and now he seemed to want to humiliate me he kept pushing it his voice growing louder and louder the other guys were starting to look uncomfortable no i said again willing him to drop it he gave me an icy look dropped the chip on the table and tried to laugh it off but he was visibly angry
movies,not_removed,i always thought hed be a cool guy to be friends with he seems very easygoing and isnt arrogantpretentious unlike some actors
movies,not_removed,sam bruce and tobey
movies,not_removed,he needs a cameo in the second season of ash vs evil dead
movies,not_removed,whoa that could be amazing bring back andrew tobey and even emma stone could play gwen spidey would also be a great way to introduce miles into the mcu along with the multiverse
movies,not_removed,i know you have given quite a time line of years but this is super unlikely the sole reason you now have to build multiverses in every single marvel character that we have onscreen it would get out of control way to quickly and confusing
movies,not_removed,i cannot wait for mcu spidey to interact with japanese spidey
movies,not_removed,i really think people are undervaluing just how important the sam raimi spiderman films were after batman killed the superhero genre film spiderman proved you could still make a successful comic book movie even if you streamline certain elements of the original story they laid the groundwork for the golden age of superhero movies were experiencing right now
movies,not_removed,i think tom holland has potential to be better than both i think he was better than garfield in just his small role in civil war than garfield was in both of his movies
movies,not_removed,punch me ill bleed
movies,not_removed,best peter garfield was the best spidey
movies,not_removed,then that new guy came around in civil war
movies,not_removed,i actually think he was the worst spiderman just in the best spiderman movies i liked garfield the best so far even though his movies sucked
movies,not_removed,william dafoe was best foe so many quotes i dont even remember what lizards portrayal left behind wanted to turn the whole world into lizards i remember that but not much else didnt see amazing
movies,not_removed,dont let nostalgia cloud your impression of the movies he was like a whiny man child the only thing good about those movies was the villains
movies,not_removed,blah tobey is so cringeinducing for me i cant rewatch the films or anything else hes in for that matter
movies,not_removed,he was a boring whiny spiderman that was nothing like the comics nostalgia helps him alot edit rewatch the movies dumbfucks theyve aged badly
movies,not_removed,not a high bar to clear holland seems like he could blow all of the others away
movies,not_removed,top kek
movies,not_removed,they certainly set the standardtone for the mcu a redditor pointed that out to me a couple months back and i was like holy cow youre right i however would argue raimi only remade that template from the foundation of the protocomic film richard donners superman
movies,not_removed,he had to be young and with newly gained powers to explain his absence from avengers
movies,not_removed,im gonna go into details of the civil war movie so if you havent watched spoilers of course well to be fair civil war seemed to not have like anything to do with the registration acts and was more about the tonycap beat down it was to the point that i thought there were going to be two civil war movies cause it felt unfinished i guess like you start strong with the accords but then the whole civil war was iron man getting mad at cap for not telling him bucky killed mr and ms stark really i understand tony was angry at the time but cmon he has to realize that bucky literally had no choice it felt weird to have such an emotional outburst from tony iunno it just felt like the movie was missing half its content
movies,not_removed,the unmasking scene should come later
movies,not_removed,that wouldve been horrible tom holland is a far better spiderman im glad we are getting films about when hes in high school finally rather than having minutes where he graduates and looks like hes
movies,not_removed,given how the plot of the civil war movie had very little to do with the comics arc of the same nameas there are only a handful of superhumans in the mcu and maybe one or two of them even have secret identities i think its totally possible they could do an mcu civil war ii movie in five or ten years once all the defenders have been established peters in his mid twenties however many other superhumans have popped up etc this one would actually be about the identity registration act from the comics peters secret identity would be longengrained and have gravity to it etc etc totally agree about the rest in terms of the current billionairebefriended kid spidey having none of the weight of maguires penniless alienated lone superhero having to make it entirely on his own steam and how desperately i wanted them to bringbacktobey for civil war
movies,not_removed,why do people get upset that they didnt follow the comics exactly its not the same civil war story at all just give it a rest
movies,not_removed,not sure if its because its super condensed but that is really bad
movies,not_removed,agreed theyve all played a different aspect of spidey pretty well
movies,not_removed,there were two other spiderman movies before this trilogy not so og now are you
movies,not_removed,rlewrongspiderman
movies,not_removed,spiderman too many spidermen
movies,not_removed,well they have the better spiderman now
movies,not_removed,thats like the actor version of being in your exs wedding party
movies,not_removed,literally copy and pasted from the youtube comments right down to the use of two full stops at the end of the sentence
movies,not_removed,they did this with the hulk lou ferrigno appears in the eric bana and edward norton movies as a random character
movies,not_removed,i know when they were talking about the lego batman movie early on one idea was to have lego batman interact with all the previous batman actors i really hope that is still a go i need lego keaton clooney kilmer west and bale all hanging out with lego arnett batman actually they should probably throw in conroy and the dude who voices lego batman in the games too for good measure and stuff
movies,not_removed,ive said it before but if they ever establish the multiverse in the mcu then the spiderverse and spidermen storylines would be cool to see on screen with bruce campbell as mysterio of course
movies,not_removed,and nicholas hammond
movies,not_removed,have them sitting with stan lee
movies,not_removed,multi dimension spiderman movie i would totally be down for that
movies,not_removed,they should do something like doctor who
movies,not_removed,no the pages description says its a fan page
movies,not_removed,you havent aged well either
movies,not_removed,cant remember the pie scene but i will forever be haunted by that dance scene
movies,not_removed,gotta love raimi
movies,not_removed,why were you so floored by that scene aha just curious
movies,not_removed,um i dont see anything interesting about the pie scene
movies,not_removed,i like to be think of it as a satire similar to raimis evil dead movies at least it made perfect sense that way seeing it for the first time yesterday and evil dead the week before i can safely say that while it was terrible as a serious movie its excellent as a series of spiderman and angsty teen jokes
movies,not_removed,and if you also like kristin wiig then watch the spoils before dying
movies,not_removed,this will not staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaandd
movies,not_removed,pussy posse counting money fuckin bitches
movies,not_removed,how can jason mewes accuse people of being rowdy
movies,not_removed,he was the nice guy in the pussy posse
movies,not_removed,this comment belongs on rthathappened
movies,not_removed,i like that they are laughing and the news ticker is going all out to make this as strange as possible
movies,not_removed,christ that is hilarious talk about contagious laughter
movies,not_removed,warning adinfested site that kills the back button
movies,not_removed,youd think a journalist would know the meaning of psychotic
movies,not_removed,god i hate toby
movies,not_removed,i really enjoyed the first season an absolute torrent of blood and oneliners it almost always gave me what i wanted
movies,not_removed,was that any good i never got around to watching it
movies,not_removed,miles could be introduced naturally though as the current spiderman gets older
movies,not_removed,would it be too cheesy to rotoscope in some of the animated spideys roger rabbit style
movies,not_removed,i think my dream casting for that film would be tom andrew and tobey reprising their roles emma stone as spidergwen bryan cranston as reign spidey and donald glover as miles oh and dev patel as spiderman india
movies,not_removed,sounds cool but much to confusing
movies,not_removed,it would be very easy for them to only show au versions of spidey characters maybe some cameos like samantha wilson or a version of frank castle i think they could rely on the stuff they set up before that and the audiences knowledge of the characters
movies,not_removed,or yes thats morgan freeman that was also written by tom whedon
movies,not_removed,spiderman stills stands as my favourite superhero film
movies,not_removed,youre forgetting about xmen which came out two years prior
movies,not_removed,if you listen to tobeys nerdist interview chris hardwick shares the same opinion as you the spiderman movies are essentially the quintessential modern superhero films of our time i believe
movies,not_removed,xmen was released two years earlier and imo set more of a tone and having patrick stewart attached added more credibility to the genre it didnt bring in as much money but it generated enough to allow other studios to take a couple of risks
movies,not_removed,i still remember seeing the first spiderman movie i was apprehensive but when toby was on screen he nailed it he was a great peter parker and they handled the source material with such care i was so happy that it was as amazing as it was
movies,not_removed,thank you for this people take for granted just how bold going to straight to the source material was for a film at the time no one thought spidermans suit would work on screen and needed to be watered down kudos to raimi for not compromising and going straight primary red and blue spidey the film was fun and more than anything had heart
movies,not_removed,look at the bro who forgot about xmen
movies,not_removed,while most of what youre saying is true i would strain to say were currently in the proverbial golden age of superhero movies id say that came with the dark knight iron man and the avengers nowadays people are getting more bored with these movies and there is a definitely drop in quality with recent releases bvs apocalypse dofp civil war etc i think were oversaturated with tentpole blockbusters that are superhero movies at the moment
movies,not_removed,spiderman proved you could still make a successful comic book movie even if you streamline certain elements of the original story that wasnt all just spiderman the xmen movies had a hand in all of that as well
movies,not_removed,maguire was a better peter parker garfield was a better spiderman tom holland so far has proven himself to get the best of both and bring a lot more from the comics and cartoon translations it just up to whoever writes and directs homecoming
movies,not_removed,i disagree he encapsulated some of the aspects of spiderman his suited personality is good but i didnt get any good vibes from peter parker so far none of the actors have been able to capture both sides of spiderman
movies,not_removed,it might be the dumbest complaint and i can concede that but i cant stand hollands voice its way too high pitched and makes him sound like a year old which is too young to be spiderman its some weird block that i had when watching cw i thought the dialogue was okay but his voice drove me insane also marisa tomei is not aunt may i cant believe out of all the things people complain about in these movies nobody has a problem with that casting aunt may is an elderly woman not a year old woman who looks
movies,not_removed,cough tom holland cough
movies,not_removed,i have to agree he just had the misfortune of being one of the few bright spots in two disappointing spiderman movies
movies,not_removed,guess you have read the civil war threads
movies,not_removed,i only really rewatch those movies for jk simmons as jj jameson perfectly cast
movies,not_removed,he was like a whiny man child no thats what most people get wrong i read the old comics not this new garbage and can ensure sure that peter was for the most time fucked tobeys peter is a more mature one hes dealing with problems in hes whole life work studies financial and family problems romantic problems friend problems all of that on top of his hero life hes posture is a very mature one when you reach certain age and see all the problems piling up im very sorry for people that cant aprecciate how great the first two movies are just because peter is not smiling and happy all the time doing tricks with his skateboard
movies,not_removed,the only thing good about those movies was the villains your movie is only as good as your villain so yeah
movies,not_removed,the first trilogy got the best villains so tas had it a bit harder in that matter
movies,not_removed,edgy
movies,not_removed,thank you raimis spiderman films were essentially the same plots as the first three superman films was the origin loses powers battles evil version of themself
movies,not_removed,oh he totally did rami adapted that properly unlike other films that attempted to but never really stuck the landing
movies,not_removed,not really maguires last spidey film was one year before iron man first mcu film they couldve easily just said peter and mj moved safely out of manhattan after that so spidey has been superretired or keeping a low profile during the events of the mcuverseit would only really be an issue with avengers and incredible hulk both of which took place in a localized part of manhattan over the course of an hour or two so its plausible peter wouldnt have been able to get there in time nay they reason they went with a younger spidey is so they can make a fresh set of teenage spidey solo adventure movies worth a billion apiece
movies,not_removed,i agree with you it never was about the registration act which is why the holland spiderman works in the film and is not pivotal as he was in the comics where you are dealing with a married peter parker who has been spiderman for a long time i agree on the content part it jumped from one thing to the other to the next the fight scene you are referencing just felt so awkward and disjointed i think black panther in this film filled the void of what spiderman actually did in the comics with how he handles the situation presented in front of him and both sides of the coin
movies,not_removed,well to be fair civil war seemed to not have like anything to do with the registration acts and was more about the tonycap beat down i understand tony was angry at the time but cmon he has to realize that bucky literally had no choice i agree with this criticism and i think civil war as a whole has a lot of similar headscratchers overlooked because its part of such a popular franchise but theres at least one plausible explanation for it the last two times we saw tony on film and aou he has ptsd tony mentions at least once in civil war and i think at least one other time in another movie how hes not a soldier he just cant shake stuff off like captain america pepper potts left him right before the beginning of civil war he clearly takes the woman rubbing her sons death in his face pretty hard hes fighting his friends war machine just got paralyzed from the eyes down he just got a nut punch to the conscience at the secret prison where the avengers were being held then on top of all of this he has a new revelation about his parents death which he was still struggling with at the beginning of the movie which hes struggled with throughout all of his movies and learns that the guy responsible is standing right in front of him in all that context which they did a lot to establish and played well with existing characterization from earlier films flipping out makes a decent amount of sense
movies,not_removed,idk you have to remember what blind rage will do to someone if the man who killed my mom was across from me i would probably lose all control and try to kill him too
movies,not_removed,im not upset that it didnt follow the comics im merely explaining the magnitude of spidermans choice in the comics and frankly how great it would have been if they chose to go that route imagine them keeping who spiderman was under wraps the whole time dont tell me they cant look at everything they kept in about star wars for the most part it would have been one hell of a reveal to show a presser with spiderman only to reveal a peter parker tobey maguire on screen
movies,not_removed,can you give a tldr who was the villain
movies,not_removed,i may have overused the term og just tryna be hip ya feel
movies,not_removed,tobey was great we barely got any new spidermen yet so its too early to do power rankings
movies,not_removed,regardless we all get the best aunt may now
movies,not_removed,what a stuttering year old
movies,not_removed,yep and if youre really cool with your ex and your exs new relationship is cool with you then everybodys cool i understand what youre saying its a really good analogy rarely but sometimes everybody knows exactly where their place is and the balance works so everybodys happy
movies,not_removed,if you have so little thought that youve resorted to copying youtube comments it might be time to think about quitting the internet
movies,not_removed,maybe it was the same person
movies,not_removed,in the norton hulk he is the university security guard bribed with a pizza
movies,not_removed,not to mention ferrigno has voiced the hulk in the movies in the avengers his voice was mixed with ruffalos and in incredible hulk it was just his
movies,not_removed,kind of figured but still found it hilarious
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,dont act like his dance moves werent outta this world
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,leonardo dicaprio and david blaine as your wing man i think he did alright
movies,not_removed,because they were tobey was famous for being in huge illegal poker rings
movies,not_removed,i understood that reference
movies,not_removed,it was so good i would have enjoyed it even if it was awful but they knocked it out of the park imo
movies,not_removed,i keep going to watch it but always go to watch it when im sitting down to eat and quickly reconsider
movies,not_removed,hell yes
movies,not_removed,either them or another alternate spiderman thats mostly identical to them they seemed to do that a lot
movies,not_removed,are the first referencing any voice actors
movies,not_removed,im deff okay with that too i just think hes the best way to introduce the multiverse something that could be really badass on screen if youve read the new secret wars you know what im picturing edit a letter
movies,not_removed,maybe the voice particularly from the animated show
movies,not_removed,wouldnt they be too old for their respecrive roles
movies,not_removed,reddit needs to stop with donald glover there are many black actors and we just started a new spiderman in the mcu meaning this spidey will be around for a long time probably a trilogy over the next years there are tons of actors that could be around years old that would be a great age for morales by the time we need to have a new spidey
movies,not_removed,youre relying on seasoned viewers if the moive was breaking to an audience of people that didnt follow routinely or kids that are seeing there first spiderman movie ever this wont work as it would be awesome to see you always have to think of these from a business perspective whats going to sell sure us readers know all about this but the vast majority the average movie goer would be completely lost and confused this is why superior spiderman ended when asm dropped when a movie comes out comic sales go up people would of been pretty confused if they picked up the book and found out doc ock was spiderman unfortunately they dont make huge blockbusters for a niche following or dedicated readers but maybe we will get something animated i mean a spiderverse film would be a trilogy in itself otherwise you are just cranking out another batman v superman with plot holes and so much convoluted plot no one know which way is up or down unless you are a die hard fan and reader
movies,not_removed,the first two spiderman movies and the first two x men movies were excellent
movies,not_removed,because its the best the spider man trilogy is the godfather trilogy of super hero films the first one is good the second is a landmark and the third
movies,not_removed,what makes it so good
movies,not_removed,oh yeah it was friggin great and it brings me back good memories
movies,not_removed,i like it but i liked the winter soldier a lot more
movies,not_removed,xmen did well well enough to justify the production of spiderman but it didnt really do any better than any other blockbuster and didnt have the widest demographic spiderman was the big one the one that broke the records and became the cultural phenomenon xmen is undoubtedly important but spiderman really set the bar for both the quality and reception of modern comic book movies
movies,not_removed,ah yes youre absolutely correct though i felt like spiderman was a lot more comic booky than the first xmen film it was more colorful and bombcastic xmen had a lot of matrix vibes except tints of blue everywhere instead of green
movies,not_removed,if were really counting here blade came first and was a huge step up from comic based films that came before and really showed marvel and other studios that good movies could be made from this material if not for blade there would be no marvel studios as we know it and it helped change the direction on both xmen and spiderman to something more serious less tongue in cheek which was what both studios were working on at the time personally i would love to see the blade movies reincorporated in to the mcu and have marvel make more films with snipes the first blade movies are good and excellent respectively and theres nothing in them that would contradict anything currently in the mcu that i can tell so with marvel having the rights back for the character bring back snipes and make a great flick that links him to the rest of the movies or maybe a netflix show that doesnt suck could be bad ass
movies,not_removed,and blade even before that it wasnt exactly the major event that sparked the renewed superhero genre but it certainly tested the waters well enough for the future ground breakers to get their chance
movies,not_removed,ill give you bvs and but dofp and civil war were both amazing hell id put civil war above both avengers movies
movies,not_removed,a lot of that is due to the writing as well tobey was writing as a great peter parker and an okay spiderman andrew was written as a great spiderman but a pretty poor peter parker and yea holland had the luxury working with limited writing that could highlight some of the characters best qualities right away
movies,not_removed,its way too high pitched and makes him sound like a year old which is too young to be spiderman too be fair peter was when he first became spiderman so while i get it its actually pretty accurate also marisa tomei is not aunt may i cant believe out of all the things people complain about in these movies nobody has a problem with that casting aunt may is an elderly woman not a year old woman who looks i get that but i just chalk this up to peters parents and aunt may being around the same age which i think marisa tomei is right around its also just a chance for a new take on a character that i dont think age is that big of a defining feature if marisa can portray who aunt may is i think its a fine choice
movies,not_removed,hollands peter parker is years old
movies,not_removed,doesnt sound too different than most year olds ive met as far as tomeimay well marvel has been trying to make may less elderly for a while it used to be you were pretty elderly in your and but now with better health care not as much
movies,not_removed,having a different opinion gets ya those negative points brother better fall in line man s
movies,not_removed,this remains to be seen scene anyhoo we wont know if holland can really own the character like garfield did until his solo movie the one that is first and foremost in my mind is the car thief scene
movies,not_removed,he certainly the most obnoxious
movies,not_removed,i felt like his second one was the strongest of allt he spideys so far so much great stuff happening electro was the coolest villain of the seriesright ahead of doc oct gwen dying a the end was a huge surprise to me and the mystery surrounding his parents death was great i think it suffered mainly from the super thin line between real and comic bookthink subway car transforming scene the staying with the comic book for his powers stuff was much better and his peter being more angsty than whiny was a better character choice for me its early in his development so he would still be pretty pissed at everything right tobey kind of got over that anger a bit too fast for me
movies,not_removed,i dont get the desire to go back and label him as the best peter or what not holland competed with tobey and andrew in just minutes of film time given a whole movie i think hell blow them out of the water
movies,not_removed,not trying to be edgy i just dont like him as an actor
movies,not_removed,holy shit thats genius i never noticed that
movies,not_removed,peter wouldnt have sat it out with great power comes great responsibility remember nick fury would have sought him out and he would have already been part of the squad and then been there when all of that broke loose or at the very least after the events of the incredible hulk he would have kept an eye on the hulk and would have tracked him to ny in the avengers because he wouldnt want the hulk wrecking ny again
movies,not_removed,on top of all that he was still on whats basically the right side of registration maybe in comics hes clearly in the right because we can think of many many examples of events which support the proregistrations position in the films we just have a handful of disasters so the sides were drawn more by who was friends with who instead of emotional connection
movies,not_removed,vulture is mary janes father who also creates electro black cat is in this script too who bangs peter after mj breaks up with him after spidey saves the day mj asks for him back and he declines final scene is spidey throwing the mask off the brooklyn bridge and retires
movies,not_removed,cringe
movies,not_removed,tobey was a great peter but holland was better as spiderman the raimi movies where more focused on how peters life was affected by being spiderman which is something i hope comes back in homecoming
movies,not_removed,rosemary harris was pretty awesome though
movies,not_removed,bs aunt may from the tobey spider man is awesome
movies,not_removed,sounds like peter parker to me
movies,not_removed,do you need a hug
movies,not_removed,dat karma tho
movies,not_removed,oh ive heard about that i meant jason mewes has a reputation himself hes changed now but rowdiness is basically the core of his public persona
movies,not_removed,if i had a gun with two bullets and i was in a room with hitler bin laden and toby i would shoot toby twice
movies,not_removed,the first one is a reference to the spiderman broadway play the second is a reference to the spiderman segments from an old educational tv show called the electric company
movies,not_removed,uhhh here i have this cheeseburger i couldnt believe that had had a pay off
movies,not_removed,honestly if they want to do miles id prefer they do him well miles chilling up with peter parker would make no sense at all make the peter parker story then kill off peter in a brutal fight with the sinister six and then introduce miles as a young kid whos trying to live up to what peter did
movies,not_removed,eh maybe a bit with tobeyandrewemma you could make it work by indirectly acknowledging that its been a while since the last time we saw them in these roles and their characters have aged accordingly donald might be a bit old to play miles but im not honestly terribly concerned with that since its so unlikely to happen anyway id mainly like to see him as miles you could just age the character up to match because of the fan push before amazing to have him play spidey
movies,not_removed,what i saw of the ultimate spiderman cartoons spiderverse looked pretty good you might be right that it would work better animated
movies,not_removed,whats up with that with the third always being weak
movies,not_removed,dark knight trilogy might be more accurate here batman begins was awesome dark knight was incredible dark knight rises good but not great
movies,not_removed,recently rewatched the third and was crying laughing at how unintentionally awkward tobey is when hes supposed to think hes being cool sam raimi knew exactly what he was doing when he cast tugboat tobey
movies,not_removed,imo spiderman is the best and the best superhero film in general
movies,not_removed,see ive tried so hard to like spiderman but i think its the weakest of that trilogy spiderman to me is much more of a landmark the second one is cluttered and not focused i dont get the love for it but hey at least people actually like these movies
movies,not_removed,the third is a turd
movies,not_removed,ehhhh i wouldnt really say that is how godfather plays out most people put as the best and most people dont think was shit just not nearly as good as and spiderman was shit one of two movies i have walked out of in my entire life
movies,not_removed,i look it that blade bunted a leadoff single xmen hit a double to put them both in scoring position and spiderman knocked it so far out of the park the floodgates opened for super hero films all three were key and led to the next
movies,not_removed,its weird seeing xmen change over the years they went from trying to distance themselves from comic books movies by having a more action tone to trying to match the tone of current comic films
movies,not_removed,to this day blade might be my favorite sequel movie ever its rare you come across one that is better than the original
movies,not_removed,i understand fully that blade does come from the comic book world but lets not pretend like the movie blade has any ties to what audiences perceive as being a comic book movie its a vampire hunter movie i dont think any noncomic book fans came out of that movie with a new appreciation for comic book movies they just enjoyed an entertaining vampire flick spiderman was absolutely the first movie to really kick off the comic book movie trend
movies,not_removed,and lets not forget that blade was really a pioneer in product placement james bond may zoom around corners in fancy cars but nobodyd had the balls to actually stop the movie while jessica biel queues up a playlist on an ipod
movies,not_removed,admittedly i meant apocalypse over dofp ive edited my original post civil war was very fun but it didnt push the superhero genre anywhere it was very technically and stylistically dull it didnt change anything in the genre i would hesitate to call civil war amazing it had very similar flaws to bvs but is ultimately better because it was at least entertaining that said my point is that there arent any genre defining superhero movies coming out now i think the golden age passed a few years ago
movies,not_removed,i liked apocalypse more than civil war tbh
movies,not_removed,well garfields was based on ultimate peter
movies,not_removed,also lets her be tonys love interest in the spiderman movie
movies,not_removed,didnt downvote him but if i had to hazard a guess id imagine that the downvotes have less to do with a differing opinion and more to do with his absolutist statements that directly contradict established spiderman lore and reveal that hes criticizing these decisions from a position of apparent ignorance year old which is too young to be spiderman as others have pointed out peter parker became spiderman at which is the same age that tom hollands peter parker is supposed to be in civil war to say that early teens is too young for spiderman is obviously going to ruffle feathers when the character being a young teen has been a major part of his characterization outside of the previous movies also marisa tomei is not aunt may i cant believe out of all the things people complain about in these movies nobody has a problem with that casting aunt may is an elderly woman not a year old woman who looks in the ultimate marvel universe aunt may is middleaged rather than old as originally portrayed the ultimate spiderman run in particular is also typically held in very high regard by fans uivtecdoyou expressed surprise that more people arent complaining about it but that surprise is unwarranted most of the fans who would normally crusade against a superficial change to a character arent bothered by aunt may being younger because none of them are particularly surprised by it the mcus interpretations of characters frequently borrows heavily from the ultimate marvel universe in particular see nick fury so that they would do the same when adapting spiderman is not unexpected
movies,not_removed,really because that scene always stood out to me as everything wrong with what those movies did with spidey they made him a dick when in the mask not fun loving
movies,not_removed,hell yes i loved garfield as spiderman i like holland too but its not the same well see how it plays out though
movies,not_removed,garfield was good at the joking spidey but holland has already surpassed him in that regard holland only had like minutes of being peter in civil war and i already think hes a better peter than garfield was
movies,not_removed,i have to disagree with you he was too mean in that scene which makes sense because he was still becoming a hero there the scene that really cememted garfield as a great spidey for me was the times square fight with electro is amazing spiderman
movies,not_removed,i feel like people that complain about this have only been exposed to spidey through the previous movies
movies,not_removed,soo yeah thats a good thing guessing you havent read or seen any spiderman comics
movies,not_removed,was the worst spiderman film to date
movies,not_removed,all of that is an unpopular opinion if ever there was one
movies,not_removed,they could have said tobey moved to upstate ny to live a normal life or something
movies,not_removed,so they break up again
movies,not_removed,weve seen holland for mins lets watch homecoming before we judge
movies,not_removed,dont know which peter youve been reading must be a pretty early incarnation
movies,not_removed,i think hes fishing for a threesome
movies,not_removed,i thought my post was pretty positive i like to find good in a bad situation but maybe youre projecting your desire for a hug on to me
movies,not_removed,it was johnathan hickman everything seemingly has a payoff with that man
movies,not_removed,show me marvel unlimited is taking too long
movies,not_removed,is emma a skeleton
movies,not_removed,that it was now lets getting something along the lines of the grittiness and darkness that flashpoint paradox did and lets get those inheritors and spiders going at it hard put those together and baby you got a stew going
movies,not_removed,both trilogies features lead actors who were not considered among fans to be the perfect onscreen realizations of their respective comic book characters these were trilogies designed as films first and it shows the next appearance of these characters in the movies that followed amazing spiderman and bvs featured more accurate representations of the characters in the comic but were poorer movies overall
movies,not_removed,to be honest i feel the same way about tdkr as many people do about spiderman
movies,not_removed,thats the actual end result too i guarantee we wouldve seen an amazing third installment if ledger didnt die
movies,not_removed,still misses the mark as dark knight rises was still an ok film where as spiderman was so bad i couldnt even finish it
movies,not_removed,the dark knight is one of my favorite movies of all time batman begins was the cheesiest movie ive ever seen though i literally spent half the movie knowing exactly what was going to happen next i could barely finish it
movies,not_removed,tdkr is worse than spiderman there i said it
movies,not_removed,dark knight isnt a superhero film
movies,not_removed,willed dafoe as the green goblin was so amazing spider man forever
movies,not_removed,thats why its called a comparison because its obviously not the same thing and i never meant to claim they were as good as the godfather films just they had a similar influence on superhero films that godfather had on cinema in general
movies,not_removed,and richard donners superman created the sport and built the stadium
movies,not_removed,thats pretty spoton the first xmen film was sort of a test balloon and didnt have as large of a budget that the filmmakers initially wanted the cues from the matrix were to make it marketable to an audience in it wasnt until the spiderman movies and especially iron manavengers that studios realized it was ok to go straight to the comics for source material
movies,not_removed,i always feel like im taking crazy pills i absolutely hated the film and i loved the third one which everyone else hated i know the one was guillermo del toro and i usually love his movies and i love blade but the weird mutant vampires and the more horror like elements of the movie just put me off
movies,not_removed,again it was testing the waters it showed studios that its possible to make an entertaining comic book based film without the camp and esoteric drivel that people previously associated with comic book adaptations
movies,not_removed,do we really need this
movies,not_removed,i mean i cant really defend my personal opinions i dont like a year old spiderman realistically because in the comic books he didnt come off as a year old i have a box of of spiderman comics that i collected as a kid including of the ultimate series which is where i fell off despite loving the art style maybe that explains my preference for an older spiderman plus a year old with just a slightly lower toned voice wouldnt have grated me nearly as bad as i said originally i know this is a super nitpicky complaint its not going to stop me from seeing the new spiderman movie and i definitely havent formed a total judgement based off of a supporting role in a fight scene and one minor supporting scene as for aunt may tomei still doesnt look anything like the ultimate series aunt may just for reference i also hated sally field as aunt may if you wanted to go younger well fine i can give up rosemary harris perfection as aunt may but at least get someone who looks older hearing the hot jokes from rdj about tomei also just made me cringe people shouldnt be making hot jokes about aunt may not in my personal view of the marvel universe im fine with the downvotes though its my personal opinion and maybe an overly nerdy love for spiderman that breaks from the popular opinion that tom holland is a god tier spiderman ill sit in my nobody has done spiderman justice and i dont think hell ever work on screen corner
movies,not_removed,he looked like he was having fun to me
movies,not_removed,i am glad that i am not the only one that thinks this i cannot stand this scene its really not spideylike at all except for when he is in the car
movies,not_removed,did you just copypaste chris stuckmanns thoughts edit lol you did dont be a sheep
movies,not_removed,which spiderman did you grow up on because i grew up with late spidey and the asm films nailed that raimi spiderman was cheesy camp version
movies,not_removed,well were discussing the movies
movies,not_removed,ive seen many animated series spider men similar enough to the first but slightly different comics spiderman must suck then
movies,not_removed,obnoxious is never a good thing bud
movies,not_removed,i hear people say this but i never understand why it had the best villaintied with doc oct and the best dad mystery elements garfield is a way better spidey than tobey and his super powers were more aligned with the comics what didnt you like
movies,not_removed,i suppose it definitely seems that way dont get it really but thats why they make the movies someone liked it other than me
movies,not_removed,like i said though even if tobey spiderman retired nick fury wouldnt just let him sit it out hed have recruited him like he recruited the other and he would have already been on alert when ny went down
movies,not_removed,right peter ultimately letting her go at the very end is actually awesome that relationship peaked at the rain nipples kiss and went very downhill from there
movies,not_removed,well yeah civil war peter is an early incarnation
movies,not_removed,i am hug me
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,there was no spiderman trilogy there were two spiderman movies with tobey mcguire
movies,not_removed,i didnt think tdkr was bad at all
movies,not_removed,oh come on thats not fair tdkr has its flaws but watch the emo spiderman piano scene and rethink your statement that is one of the worst moments ive ever seen in a movie
movies,not_removed,same here i have seen tdkr once and that was enough neveragaintdkr
movies,not_removed,its a batman movie batman is a superhero the dark knight is a superhero movie
movies,not_removed,misery misery misery thats what youve chosen
movies,not_removed,well lets face it the vampire pomeranian is pure win
movies,not_removed,i think we agree for the most part i just dont like that any time spiderman is mentioned as being the start of the comic book movie trend people invariably bring up blade as coming first even though blade has almost nothing to do with the current success of comic book movies blade has more in common with dolph lundgrens punisher than it does with the avengers
movies,not_removed,never said we need or want just based upon her being younger now civil war and the known inclusion of tony in the new spidey movie they will likely touch on this in some way
movies,not_removed,i know spidey is all about quips it is why i loved him in civil war but there his quips were child like and fun not cruel and rude spideys quips have always been about having fun and being a kid i dont know i just never got the feeling from those movies that spidey was done well
movies,not_removed,a lot of it has to do with the tone and situation that thief wasnt really playing deadpan enough for the quips to hit home he just wanted to get out of there he didnt even want to fight he may have been trying to steal a car but clearly wasnt that bad of a guy in that scenario he even said that he didnt want to use the knife he was just trying to scare spiderman off so he could run away normally with spiderman the villains are thugs and brutes and assholes they think they are tough and can just bully their way out of confrontation thats why spidermans quips work because he is making fun of these types of guys like dodging a huge muscular guy who is overconfident and then making fun of how slow he is that element is not present in that scene the thief isnt much of a jerk hes just scared and wants to get out of there so the way spiderman takes things overboard and makes it a point to taunt and toy with him makes him come off as a douchebag rather than the playful teasing underdog he is meant to be plus i cant stand the way he talks its likenot even really a new york accent its like a forced urban punk cool kid accent spiderman should not sound like that he should be dorky but clever
movies,not_removed,this is hilarious
movies,not_removed,except for the fact that the ams is nothing like this and mid was the clone wars which we usually dont talk about and you have ben for most of the time anyways late is piggy backing of secret wars which is black suit era which tends to be darker none of which have many if any similarities to the asm series
movies,not_removed,spiderman is essentially supposed to be like a nonmeta deadpool
movies,not_removed,i thought it had the worst villain of the series tied with venom in andrew was a better spidey but a terrible peter and the only difference in the powers was that the web shooters were mechanical i didnt like the rushed overstuffed plot that made spiderman tame by comparison i didnt like the harry osborn as goblin before we ever saw norman as goblin i didnt like the obvious gwen death she was wearing the exact same outfit as she did in the comics it was a given that she was going to die i hated the mecharhino and the cliffhanger ending was not good either need i go on
movies,not_removed,but he didnt start recruiting avengers until
movies,not_removed,thats not the only thing that peaked during the rain nipples kiss ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
movies,not_removed,right which is pretty terrible
movies,not_removed,omg yes
movies,not_removed,i feel like at least some of that has to have been intentional like peter was a nerd who didnt know how cool people acted so he just managed a very poor imitation of how to be cool because he was confident all of a sudden look at peoples reactions they arent looking at him enviously they are looking at this weird creepy emo person dancing in the street
movies,not_removed,if you didnt like tobey then steer clear of the andrew garfield should have been aborted disasters they are truly bad
movies,not_removed,its not bad but i absolutely hate the last twenty minutes the talia twist banes death and batman death fakeout all cheapen the movie especially the bane stuff they take away his incredible backstory and he gets just blasted away with a oneliner it ruins his character for me and i always preferred talia being a sort of antiheroine instead of a villain
movies,not_removed,tdkr to me is landslides ahead of tdk i dont get the love for that film either its jam packed of boring stuff the chinese mafia gang idk
movies,not_removed,tdkr has its flaws but watch the emo spiderman piano scene and rethink your statement that is one of the worst moments ive ever seen in a movie that didnt bother me in the slightest it takes a lot more for me to dislike a movie than a character wears black gets angry dances and goes to a jazz club
movies,not_removed,the emo spiderman scene is great it shows how much of a fucking oblivious nerd peter parker is because this is what he thinks being cool is like that entire sequence is like the highlight of the movie its supposed to be absurd and comical
movies,not_removed,but watch the emo spiderman piano scene the talia al ghul death scene was pretty awful dude also the entire it will be painful for you dialogue was pretty awful in fact it became a meme
movies,not_removed,obviously tdkr cooler and more mature and watchable but lets be honest it is a swiss cheese mess of plot holes i generally dont mind a movie making campy choices for us all to feel superior about i mean was obviously tha kidz but as long as it has a semblance of internal consistency im cool its biggest plotline mishandlings are with sandman and the symbiotes introduction tdkr has more than i care to list right now
movies,not_removed,i think the robin name drop at the end of tdkr is like twenty times stupider than the emo scene or anything in spiderman actually that was one of the worst things ever it made no sense and was just total pandering to the jocktype batman fans who fell in love with the dark knight i like the emo scene in obviously something was done wrong because so many people misinterpret that scene as genuine when it is so clearly farcical to me but if most of the audience doesnt understand it that way than it is a fault in the movie but at least it tried something tdkr doesnt have a bit of originality or fun the whole movie seemed like scraping the bottom of the batman barrel
movies,not_removed,im not a huge film critic hulk fan i find the whole thing too gimmicky but really helped explain this scenes reputation for me and why its not as bad as constantly stated
movies,not_removed,not fair please
movies,not_removed,people always focus on this but i always remember the scene where venom and sandman meet up in some random alley two radically different and super weird guys whove never met before and casually over the course of like seconds decide to team up wtf
movies,not_removed,naw hes just a dude with money who borrowed some stuff
movies,not_removed,blade has almost everything to do with the current trend though if not for blade both spiderman and xmen would have been campy tongue in cheek relatively low budget affairs blade convinced marvel sony and fox that higher quality more serious comic book films could be made and could work well as a response marvel started to plan there own films and fox completely revised the initial plan for the xmen film seeking out a filmmaker only known for a gritty crime suspense drama at the point in time and coming up with an entirely new film concept for him to work with sony did similar and both came out with films that to some extent at least revered the source but also didnt pander to fans more serious minded films than what had come before this was all due to the success modest as it may have been of blade a movie that was good in its own right showed respect to its source material but ultimately just tried to be a good action movie something that hadnt been done successfully outside of maybe superman though the camp was strong with reeves
movies,not_removed,you get the only reason we they had them shooting looks at each other and tony commenting on how good she looks was mostly a nod to the film
movies,not_removed,his quips are straight up savage sometimes especially when he goes against kingpin in ultimate spiderman he uses the quips as a psychological weapon
movies,not_removed,you got downvoted because you youre being a bitch after getting caught instead of owning up to it if youre gonna be a sheep fuckin fine people will agree with they guy who said that first and thats no biggie
movies,not_removed,i loved electro i thought he was great as the villain menacing losing it mentally sympathetic and the design and voice was awesome the harry as goblin was fine with me i didnt need to see his dad do it we saw that in the first film i also didnt read the comic so gwen dying was a huge surprise floored me the rhino bit was great i thought it was a good way to show him getting back in the saddle didnt need to be giammati but i was ok with that ending
movies,not_removed,ok then he would have recruited tobey spiderman in even if he had retired nick fury probably knew everything about him just like he did the others
movies,not_removed,id love to hear why you thought it was terrible it was a pretty spot on high school peter
movies,not_removed,youre getting downvoted like crazy maybe its time to just stop
movies,not_removed,everyone who doesnt realize this and instead thinks those scenes were intended to be straight is a foamingatthemouth retard i do think they drag and should have been reworked but its not that big a deal and having three villains is a much bigger problem with the movie
movies,not_removed,mmm ive not read that much batman and while i knew talia wasnt exactly her daddys girl and bane had a lot more depth than just being poison ivys bitch i was fresh enough to take the movie at face value i agree that the final act didnt feel like a worthy culmination of what had been an epic trilogy bane was wasted talia was meh and i think the epilogue would have been better if you just saw alfred smiling to himself startled and choked with emotion and then the credits rolled fuck it if youre employing an actor like michael caine give them a bit of a workout its not the movie the second one was but its a long way from being a bad movie
movies,not_removed,sounds like your personal biased and expectations got in the way of the film as someone who had none i thought the movie was very good same thing happened with the watchmen
movies,not_removed,dont forget blakes birth name
movies,not_removed,i think what people love i know what i love about tdk is the joker they absolutely nailed the relationship between joker and batman and at the same time they rendered a terrifying version of him in a believable setting they managed to keep some of the theatricality and remove almost all of the cartoonishness and came up with a really really nasty maniac who was horrifying because he was so believable while at the same time being so intellectually untouchable as to be a real major threat for batman that the only reason he hadnt killed batman and utterly annihilated the city was because he was limited by his own sense of what was fun im sorry ill gush about heath ledgers joker for ages and how joker batman is one of the most interesting comic book relationships i know of and i know none of this is particularly original thought but thats basically why i rate it anyway
movies,not_removed,hey they had to get the movie to sell in china somehow
movies,not_removed,you probably love the musical number in return of the jedi special edition too
movies,not_removed,yeah enough people dont get this when hes acting cool and the beautiful women cringe in front of him on the street thats a comedy beat we arent supposed to be invested in a grimdark reading of what is on film because it simply isnt what is shown
movies,not_removed,i mean its sam raimi its like people forgot his campy humorin the one he overtly referenced his evil dead films in the hospital sequencehe likes silliness and slapstick
movies,not_removed,im with you its a great scene it has a point to make and executes perfectly people complaining that it is a cringey scene and that its not what cool looks like didnt get the point i guess others have said that thats not what the black goop is supposed to do which is a valid complain but is more related to the writingor adaptation of the character than the actual scene
movies,not_removed,best defense of this sequence ive seen
movies,not_removed,its like all the people going on about anne hathaways characters love monologue in interstellar it was supposed to be thought stupid she was desperate mcconaugheys character totally dismissed her
movies,not_removed,the real problem with these scenes is that they last way too long the scene with him dancing down the street wouldnt have made everyone cringe so much if it wasnt like minutes long
movies,not_removed,which would be fine except it undercuts the tone of peter succumbing to the symbiotes influence
movies,not_removed,but its not
movies,not_removed,ill take tdkr plotholes over bvs plotholes any day
movies,not_removed,i love reddits obsession with plot holes without ever explaining what plot holes theyre even talking about
movies,not_removed,especially since the real joke that this what a confident peter parker actually lookact like hilarious is this the part youre refering to it actually baffles me that people didnt get this while watching the scene what did you think the point of the scene was before reading this why did you think it was bad this sounds condescending as fuck but im really just curious
movies,not_removed,sure sometimes but that is definitely not the rule of thumb for spidey and certainly not what i would expect from a very new and early edition of that character
movies,not_removed,they could have said he retired over the symbiote shit and fury never got to recruit him
movies,not_removed,i think high school peter is terrible
movies,not_removed,the watchmen was beautiful and to boot what every comic book fan out there wanted to see the most faithful adaptation of any comic book ever you can follow the movie with the book in hand and its magical but where fans happy fuck no most people are film snobs and could only find negative things to say about it its a real shame
movies,not_removed,i was with the movie up until this point at least i thought most of it was enjoyable that bit about his name at the end though bullshit just tacky
movies,not_removed,oh yeah i completely agree that everything about the heath ledger performance was amazing but i maybe feel that people are blind to the rest of the movie because of how good he is
movies,not_removed,the thing that confuses me about this is that the other spiderman movies definitely had comedy scenes why did people think comedy was so unwelcome in these movies
movies,not_removed,yeah spiderman sucked because they took venom one of the most awesome villainsorganisms and made himit not scary heck not even creapy
movies,not_removed,ive had this argument before its comedy
movies,not_removed,actually that is what the black goop does in the comics it just got retconned in the
movies,not_removed,you mean the only defense that ever gets parroted on reddit
movies,not_removed,well you didnt just google it and im sure you arent just being snide to a stranger on the internet to feel superior so if im so loathesome why are you going out of your way to press me for more of my opinions the short version with an explanation that the long version would be exhausting was just not enough of me for you huh
movies,not_removed,what i always thought it was funny and thats what it was going for but for people on reddit its the bad tangible moment
movies,not_removed,good point but maybe it depends on what villian it is too vulture kingpin and rhino are very easily angered and spiderman is hilariously brutal towards them
movies,not_removed,yeah i dont mean to be rude or accusatory but how many spiderman comics have you actually read he has pretty much always been borderline douchey to his villians it pisses them off and gives him an advantage its actually a pretty crucial part of his character
movies,not_removed,if hes just going to retire and stay retired then why involve him at all
movies,not_removed,you dont like most iterations then
movies,not_removed,agreed and i think alot of people were quick to just praise ledger because he died i thought he was gonna be a great joker by the one picture of brokeback back mt where has the smile and it had that high cheek bone smile that i thought would really work for the joker kinda like nicolson high cheekbones
movies,not_removed,of course they are
movies,not_removed,someone shoot that theme park idiot whos in charge of this circus
movies,not_removed,how long is the play
movies,not_removed,just another example of a studio trying to milk a popular franchise for all its worth irregardless of common sense or the authors wishes not that i didnt love wb turning the the hobbit into a slog
movies,not_removed,i hate when people behave irregardlessly
movies,not_removed,interesting article i highly recommend this doco gave me a whole new appreciation for casablanca a film id never given much time to before and why its considered one of the greatest films ever some interesting insight into the hollywood studio machines of the era that makes todays hollywood look almost independent by comparison it was one of fifty films being made by warner bros at that time hollywood made films like detroit used to make automobiles perfect for both fans and newcomers alike includes steven spielberg and only goes for like minutes so definitely worth it
movies,not_removed,one of the things about classic is when they come out they often get mixed reviews or weak box offices
movies,not_removed,turner and hooch
movies,not_removed,the other guys but with them replacing the rock and samuel l jacksons characters instead they jump but obviously dont die and proceed to wreak amazing havoc throughout the rest of the movie
movies,not_removed,can we make bad lieutenant a buddy cop movie i would love to see the hulkster and the macho man going through a drug meltdown while investigating a nuns brutal rape
movies,not_removed,tango and cash because im the only one who can imagine that
movies,not_removed,lethal weapon because i say so
movies,not_removed,stop or my mom will shoot
movies,not_removed,rush hour because the fight scenes would be tremendous
movies,not_removed,heat hulk as neil savage as hanna
movies,not_removed,who framed roger rabbit i dont care if its not a buddy cop film you do it
movies,not_removed,turner and hooch because the hulksters been a very bad dog
movies,not_removed,all of them become equal you cant defeat the mega powers brother
movies,not_removed,tombstone
movies,not_removed,running scared
movies,not_removed,men in black not quite a buddy cop movie but close enough
movies,not_removed,fucking all of them come out best
movies,not_removed,hot fuzz
movies,not_removed,nick nolte as hogan and eddie murphy as savage
movies,not_removed,lets be cops
movies,not_removed,none grow up and stop watching wrestling
movies,not_removed,same this was the first thing that came to mind
movies,not_removed,god damn it you beat me to it
movies,not_removed,drug meltdown that made me realize i shouldve asked any buddy movie so someone could answer fear and loathing in las vegas but i like your idea make em do some real acting
movies,not_removed,macho mans gotta be riggs right
movies,not_removed,hulk im getting too old for this sht
movies,not_removed,i agree because i want to see them do the toilet bomb scene from the second one
movies,not_removed,with hulk hogan as murtaugh except he still thinks hes black
movies,not_removed,thats easy though because lethal weapon is by far and large the best buddy cop movies ever made
movies,not_removed,come to think of it it does sort of count as one two wildly different characters have to work together to solve a mystery
movies,not_removed,flying elbows and legdrops arent meant to be wasted on bushes
movies,not_removed,i watched all four on netflix this week and i noticed something in the first one the fact that one is black and the other white is never brought up not even once unless i missed it it was so refreshing because it seems like movies these days simply cant avoid commenting on race constantly murtaugh was murtaugh and riggs was riggs and it never crossed either characters mind to make an issue of it
movies,not_removed,a pretty good amount of it relies on the talent and charm of its leads though
movies,not_removed,i think theres one instance of implication but its never said outright and i think it happens in the first one when theyre still fresh partners and murtaughs getting a feel for riggs maybe after the jumper scene on the whole though youre right
movies,not_removed,whether you chalk it up to donner black or glover and gibson not many films capture organic conversation like they do
movies,not_removed,really though id expect any movie with the two people op wants us to substitute in as the leads to fail miserably
movies,not_removed,cant wait for this to bomb at cannes
movies,not_removed,ill give it a chance the artist seemed gimmicky to me but louis garrel is a terrific actor and his dad is a great filmmaker who was a contemporary of godards so it could be interesting
movies,not_removed,jeanluc godard is still alive til
movies,not_removed,this post is really making me question your understanding of wes anderson
movies,not_removed,that was a super funny movie bills combover was just way too funny classic movie
movies,not_removed,big ern reminds me of norm duke for some reason his tirade after winning a tournament is something mccracken would totally do also it is in somewhat poor taste but the joke about ern having a long drive ahead of him that night so he tells the waitress to make sure the drinks are coming one right after another is hilarious
movies,not_removed,it feels like a farley brothers film because it is a farley brothers film see their other films they have a similar feel since they are all made by the farley brothers dumb and dumber hall pass me myself amp irene shallow hal stuck on you theres something about mary
movies,not_removed,kingpin has always been an interesting film in the farrelly collection as they didnt write or produce it it still comes across as very much one of their films but it also seems like there was a fair bit of improvised stuff going on from the really talented cast its like the script wasnt great so they set about improving it on the fly
movies,not_removed,the comb overs falling all over the place toward the end of the big match at the end makes me laugh every time
movies,not_removed,this movie is absolute gold and the four leads all nail it randy quaid gets some especially great dumb lines to this day whenever anyone farts i holler hey everybody theres a shitcloud comin run for your lives
movies,not_removed,kingpin is times better than any wes anderson filmto me its the farelly bros masterpiecewoody vomiting after having sex with the old landlady and she says oh come on it wasnt that bad was it and later in another gross out scene well in that case i better brush my teeth we were on the floorand randy quaid was great also plus that fun ending song by blues traveler
movies,not_removed,you almost have to read between the lines with watching the film instead at face value to see the simplicity of some of the scenes in the movie that remind me of a wes anderson film and not as face value
movies,not_removed,the fact that it is such a simple joke without the typical black comedy joke in which maybe someone gets hit with something gives it that hysterical effect
movies,not_removed,but the joke about ern having a long drive ahead of him that night so he tells the waitress to make sure the drinks are coming one right after another is hilarious haha yeah
movies,not_removed,lmao
movies,not_removed,i agree but is somewhat more passive than dumb and dumber
movies,not_removed,lmfao that was the best did you know paul simon approved for the song to be specifically that scene
movies,not_removed,only read the first paragraph shut up and take my fucking money
movies,not_removed,maybe im just old but i dont recognize this is it a book turned into a movie is it a graphic novel nothing about the title is ringing any bells for me god i hope this isnt another jupiter ascending
movies,not_removed,not sure why youre getting downvoted for just asking a question kingsman is a graphic novel written by mark millar who wrote kick ass the first film came out a couple of years ago and was great this is a sequel to that but isnt based on any literature the book hasnt had a sequel yet
movies,not_removed,seeking a friend for the end of the world its quite the whirlwind of emotions and as much as i hate it i love this movie for all its feels
movies,not_removed,eternal sunshine of the spotless mind check it out on netflix
movies,not_removed,me and earl and the dying girl is the only movie that makes me curl up and bawl like a fucking cow every time i watch it if you can handle it thats the one i suggest every fucking time and it just sneaks up on you you have no idea that the movie is getting to you its charming its sweet kinda quirky you dont even realize its happening at first and then its too late
movies,not_removed,big fish
movies,not_removed,no country for old men had me feelin for lewellen moss and his predicament
movies,not_removed,what dreams may come
movies,not_removed,the way way back and the spectacular now are very very good coming of age movies that had me really questioning life
movies,not_removed,blue valentine
movies,not_removed,clerks the part when randall is begging dante not to move away i cry every time
movies,not_removed,fox and the hound has to be one of the saddest movies ive ever seen runner up the iron giant
movies,not_removed,as a guy who grew up with a lot of home problems i can not recommend short term on netflix enough
movies,not_removed,these suggestions are all lovely i would add crazy heart
movies,not_removed,this is england movie and tv series combined i have never seen acting like that here in the us especially during some of the tv series scenes its a uk show the punkskin thing drew me in but it doesnt really dive too deep into all of that but as the show went on after the movie you see all of them evolve and grow up a couple of the plot points are very hard to watch and honestly the acting was so good throughout the show that i was emotionally drained at the end but dammit we need one more season i cared for every character in that show
movies,not_removed,october sky
movies,not_removed,her but be prepared you may cry i personally cannot watch this film without bawling my eyes out
movies,not_removed,a bit late but i wanted to include kikis delivery service its an animation movie by studio ghibli its a great character movie and given that im still barely an adult it really stuck with me
movies,not_removed,something borrowed if you can stand the romantic comedy genre
movies,not_removed,field of dreams
movies,not_removed,one that touched me deeply was its such a beautiful day there are not many films that can match that for me and it was such a surprise too it resonated so strongly that i watched it again immediately after
movies,not_removed,truly madly deeply

movies,not_removed,not going to lie man of steel really hit it home for me i was in some situations that were like what clark was going through and him trying to be this figure of hope really helped me

movies,not_removed,wwwyoutubecomuserashubhais
movies,not_removed,thank
movies,not_removed,i am complete
movies,not_removed,this is not the greatest and best fan art in the world this is just a tribute
movies,not_removed,just waiting for the day this gets released on bluray which is never
movies,not_removed,the fact that the devil is david grohl made this movie go from great to fucking awesome
movies,not_removed,im the devil i love metal
movies,not_removed,this is the greatest and best fanart in the world tribute
movies,not_removed,he even got his master exploderroseanne face down
movies,not_removed,youre gonna gargle mayonnaise
movies,not_removed,jeeze louise papa cheese
movies,not_removed,i think the saddest thing about tenacious d the pick of destiny is that its the last film jack black has written specifically because he was embarrassed by how bad the film did in theaters this is still one of my favourite films as dumb as it can seem
movies,not_removed,perfectly captured jack black face well done
movies,not_removed,fleegle geegle fleegle geegle mama lucifer
movies,not_removed,who doesnt love the d
movies,not_removed,burrito supreme
movies,not_removed,that would make a kick ass tshirtgreat job pity about the movie
movies,not_removed,never felt like this movie was as good as it could have been especially with a premise and cast like that it definitely has its moments but it just fell flat for me dunno why i personally feel like school of rock does the whole rockingthing better anyway cool art
movies,not_removed,whos got two thumbs and just found his new phone wallpaper points at self this guy
movies,not_removed,jeff does great stuff you can find more on his instagram account httpswwwinstagramcomjeffdelgadoart
movies,not_removed,jack looks like chucky and kg doesnt look like kg
movies,not_removed,i really liked pick of destiny despite what critics and normal people may have thought about it the one thing i got hung up on was how it drew significantly from the content on their hbo show that wouldnt matter so much to me since i saw pod before seeing the clips from the show though it did color my perception after the fact it didnt deserve the harsh critique it got except for the sasquatch scene terrible shift in mood and pacing i guess thats my version of dae le gem
movies,not_removed,i misread this as fanfart because i read its about the pick of destiny ☺
movies,not_removed,fuuuuuuuccccckkkkk
movies,not_removed,theres a clean version of this album its hilarious all the swear words are taken out except for the word ass in kickapoo for this part instead of fuck fuck fucccccccccccccccck it becomes dang drats fuuuuuuuuuudge lots of mothertruckers in there as well one of the best lyrical changes is from he is going to kick your fucking ass to he is going to mow your freakin grass
movies,not_removed,i was so upset in the theater that they didnt do that song at the end of the movie also at how lame the rock off with the devil was the ds part not the devils
movies,not_removed,you never know last i heard was that jack black said they were working on more tenacious d albums and possibly movie or series
movies,not_removed,this isnt on bluray oh my god what why i know its not a very good movie but its one of my favorite not very good movies kg and jables make me feel good
movies,not_removed,check this riff its fucking tasty
movies,not_removed,it was such a big hit with my friends and i when we were teenagers i was so surprised to find out it did so poorly really sad that jack and kyle dont see it as successful
movies,not_removed,and a chicken supreme
movies,not_removed,hey tenacious d is a legendary movie easily one of my favourite comedies i dont understand why it flopped
movies,not_removed,thanks im wishing they somehow manage to make a sequel
movies,not_removed,what did you not like about the movie i always felt like the movie achieved what it set to acieve despite how it did with general audiences
movies,not_removed,youre a fat loser and you have body odor
movies,not_removed,yes you are fucked
movies,not_removed,where do i find this
movies,not_removed,im pretty sure the cornyness added to the joke
movies,not_removed,dont know about you but i love the ending song in the movie while not as good a song as tribute it fits the tone of that film so well
movies,not_removed,fuck yes
movies,not_removed,i saw them live at a small venue it was as good as you could imagine so much fucking energy
movies,not_removed,he rocks too hard because hes not a mortal man
movies,not_removed,i love the film and watch it frequently it was a very niche film to begin with that went allin on their microcosm add in some stoner undertones and various overthetop crude humor and i can see why it only appealed to a select few definitely not a wide enough appeal to be successful
movies,not_removed,oh im not looking to hate on it i love the d and have seen them live twice but personally i found it pretty average especially when compared to the original hbo skits it starts off pretty good but the end wasnt that funny and actually got pretty cringe in some parts use the cock thats just my opinion though if you loved it more power to you also if you havnt seen it this gives a pretty disheartening view of the time in regards to why it may have flopped from the bands perspective
movies,not_removed,its not just funny but also a fun movie to watch especially with friends i really feel like it should be one of those midnight movies like rocky horror and the room
movies,not_removed,yeah id dig that but the first one flopped pretty hard so i doubt it will happen as jack said in the documentary maybe people are just over my flavor
movies,not_removed,agreed
movies,not_removed,huhfine shit out of luck
movies,not_removed,i think itunes may have it uh i used to subscribe to xbox music and they definitely had it clean versions of both pod and rize of the fenix gosh i havent heard it in a while but its my favorite version of the album ill see if i can find another place where its at totally worth the purchase if you find it it looks like youtube has some not great quality so far as i can tell that or my speaker finally died heres beelzeboss from youtube the others are there too
movies,not_removed,yeah i saw them in philly a few years back when they dropped that rise of the phoenix album great show except their opening act got booed and heckled by the merciless philly crowd it was awkward but the d rocked it hard
movies,not_removed,what the hell is that video its over an hour of just the universal logo
movies,not_removed,im worried about jack black he seems really down these last few years did anyone else see his getting doug with high appearance he looked like he was in a really dark place i know he doesnt smoke often but it looked like the weed just amplified the problems he was going through i remember they had to stop the interview a few different times to let him get a hold of himself which is pretty uncommon for that show
movies,not_removed,now im completed my cock you will suck
movies,not_removed,to be your little boy lol that was great thanks for that
movies,not_removed,sasquatch opened for them he was awesome literally sasquatch in a tuxedo jack black threw his pick and i caught it and someone slapped it out of my hand before i could close it it was the happiest and saddest moment of my life and it happen in less than seconds
movies,not_removed,fixed
movies,not_removed,yeah i get you hopefully hes just having a rough patch comedic brilliance and depression can often walk hand in hand and its a very common trait for comedians to have pretty bipolar personalities hopefully he was just having a bad day hes got a beautiful family and even if hes been a bit down im sure hell truck on though long live the d m
movies,not_removed,this world will be mine
movies,not_removed,almost felt like they were mocking the censorship there haha

movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i actually find it very unappetizing which is why i like it for some reason
movies,not_removed,oh deer
movies,not_removed,i dont expect the crowd to really care about this death
movies,not_removed,fuck
movies,not_removed,they should he reached yrs old
movies,not_removed,shit
movies,not_removed,theres million readers on this subreddit think about that number for a little while millions of different opinions you wont agree with all of them hell you may not agree with most of them this sub wont always cater to your tastes unfortunately
movies,not_removed,thought it was pretty good but yeah its just like peoples opinions man
movies,not_removed,im sorry we shall adjust our personal tastes and preferences to be more in line with yours in the future
movies,not_removed,its fine to dislike a movie that other people liked a lot personally i disliked deadpool
movies,not_removed,uh oh someones mad that their opinion didnt match a large percentage on something that is subjective to begin with call an ambulance
movies,not_removed,you dont seem to realise that recommendations are based on opinions which is different from person to person no one can tell you if you are going to like a movie or not
movies,not_removed,i see this kind of post all the time when a movie is hyped you get your expecatations heightened so when you see it it doesnt quite meet the hype take in mind that the people who hyped the movie saw it before the hype which made the movie even better because there were no expectations
movies,not_removed,oh no you have your opinions about a movies and dont enjoy what a large crowd of people enjoy thats fine dont try to make a big deal out of it because everyone has their own tastes and yours are very different go movie to rtruefilms
movies,not_removed,i didnt like the movie much either the trailer looked ok but didnt deliver for me i only use trailers and who is in the cast to choose what to seethat doesnt let me down very often
movies,not_removed,thats fair liking movies is extremely subjective and you might like a certain movie more because you can relate to it while the majority of people dont or vice versa i personally enjoyed the nice guys except for the daughter i felt like she really brought down the movie i wouldnt recommend it to people though unless they showed interest
movies,not_removed,never blindly listen to anyones opinion i loved nice guys but hated kingsman you dont have to agree with everything people say on this subreddit
movies,not_removed,i thought it was good but people act like it was the second coming some jokes landed good some fell flat story was complicated and not explained well and wasnt too compelling i think the third act is the best though
movies,not_removed,i just come here for movie trailers and for the rare occasions where people bring up old directors that i never knew much about tarkovsky yasujiro ozu other than that i agree most people here tend to overhype film as the best thing since sliced bread nice guys was an enjoyable film but nowhere the masterpiece rmovies made it out to be
movies,not_removed,i liked the nice guys but yeah i know what you mean after seeing the witch im extremely weary of movies that are circlejerked on this forum i fkn hated walle as well and everytime i mention it i get downvoted lol
movies,not_removed,yet everybody here loves the same movies pacific rim interstellar john wick
movies,not_removed,only because its a default every new account is automatically added as a subscription
movies,not_removed,i was also not a fan of the witch there are dozens of us
movies,not_removed,it seems to me the majority of people here like the art school stuff pretty and valuable but ignoring its boring as shit
movies,not_removed,same it had its moments but was trying to be too hard to be meta but was really just cliched
movies,not_removed,me too its not bad but i dont get why people love it so much its generic as hellnot counting the wall breaks which is by the way not that funny
movies,not_removed,yea it was just ok they pretty much showed all the good parts in the previews
movies,not_removed,why didnt you like kingsman
movies,not_removed,thanks i think ill skip it now love wall e though
movies,not_removed,pacific rim was utter garbage
movies,not_removed,john wick was like dredd lot of violence but much of it felt fake unlike the raid
movies,not_removed,it seems to me the majority of people here like the art school stuff pretty and valuable but ignoring its boring as shit maybe you just dont enjoy those types of movies nothing wrong with that it is really hard for me to believe that you would think something written and directed by shane black is a indieart house movie the guy has been one of the top action writers of the last years
movies,not_removed,this sub loves indie bowls of shit the vvitch it follows the babadook the nice guys which i found all terrible for the horror movies theyre not scary at all and im not joking theyre seriously not scary so i have no idea who these delicate fuckers are that are everywhere in this sub the nice guys was a generic buddy cop movie that i didnt find funny so when this sub is gushing over how original and hilarious it is its an exaggeration and when they question why it did shit in the box office its because no one found it interesting enough to watch it in theaters
movies,not_removed,i feel like matthew vaughn has a similar issue to zach snyder in that all their movies feel like theyre made to appeal to year olds theyre super edgy they act smarter than they are and none of the jokes make me laugh his only movie i really liked was xmen first class kingsman was just the last nail in the coffin for me when it comes to matthew vaughn everything was supposed to be so clever and the action was so over the top but none of it was fun for me to watch i also saw a lot of people talking about how amazing the church scene was and when i watched it i was extremely underwhelmed the way it was shot just broke all immersion
movies,not_removed,no kidding
movies,not_removed,have you seen that movie moon its a cinematic masterpiece s
movies,not_removed,i agree just wanted to point out that million people arent posting their recommendations here
movies,not_removed,i never found the babadook scary but being the delicate fucker i am i found the themes of depression loneliness and sexual frustration interesting and engaging the films you mentioned have so much more to them then trying to scare people its quite simplistic way to look at it
movies,not_removed,im with you babadook was decent but not scary and that son was annoying with his screaming and the ending was so obvious it follows was all right until it broke all its own rules both movies had good atmosphere and were off center pretty like you said indie movie but that alone does not redeem them
movies,not_removed,hmm disagree completely but thanks for the insight
movies,not_removed,thats the point who gives a shit what other people think
movies,not_removed,it makes anh better and removes one of the most comedically stupid elements of the death star hes saying the empire were stupidbut the whole joke was that they were dumb enough to include a port that luke could fire a torpedo into because a ghost told him to this actually makes it reasonable and his issue is now well now its not as special luke still did it its just less stupid on the empires part what bothers me is that max landis is generally a total privileged idiot who calls tfa unoriginal fanfiction about a mary sue this is the guy who loves lukes million to one shot to win a space battle with zero experience and who wrote chroniclewhich is essentially akira fan fic
movies,not_removed,ugh this guy is irritating instead of writing out actual criticisms he just rants like a jerk
movies,not_removed,the special effect totally still hold up great movie and the guy who played sherlock in this had a cameo in mr holmes
movies,not_removed,before a lifetime of adventure the adventure of a lifetime im sold
movies,not_removed,i absolutely loved this movie as a youngster and rewatched it recently and it is still very good i am bummed it never really took off as you are right op it is very similar to harry potter
movies,not_removed,did he thats very cooland since you mention it i can recommend mr holmes without any reservations surely its the only time an actor in his seventies has worn age makeup to play an older character
movies,not_removed,the umbrellas of cherbourg is another more unknown musical that wasnt listed damien chazelle has actually i think said that it was the biggest influence on the movie and one of his favorites
movies,not_removed,chicago
movies,not_removed,none
movies,not_removed,young girls of rochefort too
movies,not_removed,yes majestic hey ultra you should do a supermans journey video from man of steel starting from when he was just a boy in kansas right through to his triumphant return in justice league if anyone could do that its you making it a collab with adeel would be cool he really gets the character and you just have a knack for making videos look amazing and filled with emotion you really put your all into them itd be an awesome video to see﻿
movies,not_removed,excellent reviewlook forward to this one﻿
movies,not_removed,its to try to grab the viewers attention before they can skip the ad when they play it on youtube etc
movies,not_removed,these trailers are played as ads before videos on youtube to keep people from skipping after five seconds the marketers have begun showing a quick montage of clips from the trailer before the full thing plays in the hopes that this will grab peoples attention and convince them not to skip the trailer
movies,not_removed,to get as much clicksviews as possible in they always talk about how much that trailer got viewed etc new record
movies,not_removed,ah of course thats super obvious now
movies,not_removed,its to try to grab the viewers attention before they can skip the ad when they play it on youtube etc they could just only have that on the youtube advert and not the youtube video of the trailer though
movies,not_removed,which is ironic to me because i personally am more likely to watch a trailer ad that does not have the clipshow in the beginning
movies,not_removed,why is it on the youtube video of it make a separate one for those who want to watch it properly unless youre marketing to people who dont watch it in that case its utterly pointless
movies,not_removed,i loved generations especially picard being fucking devastated about his family and how it affected him throughout the movie also kirk fulfilling his fate from what he said in star trek v
movies,not_removed,i fucking love generations one of my favorites so cerebral and full of metaphor and hard choices it wasnt just having the two captains the themes and stylistic choices of the movie combined and twisted both original and next in such a cool way and seriously about as real a spoiler
movies,not_removed,brilliant scene the slight plot hole of how that missile reached the star so quickly is going to bug me forever now never really noticed that before
movies,not_removed,generations has a special place in my heart i am a huge trekkie and i follow the shows with a passion for me generations felt like a exended episodic continuation of tng it was a movie but it had much of the feeling of the show wrapped around it the following film first contact was where it felt the next generation stepped into the movie atmosphere for me generations showed the stamina and commitment picard had in his heart his soul of what he must do and for the sake of others even when facing tests of his own he puts the need of others and his rightful duty above himself it was great to see for an instant captains of the enterprise who were generations apart bond together and fight for what was right
movies,not_removed,earth tones people browns and beige and browns and beige oh wait wrong movie
movies,not_removed,i enjoy the tng movies but you cant think about them too much i actually submitted this to a cracked photoplasty years ago about movie plots that could have been resolved easier httpimgurcomazosno
movies,not_removed,absolutely loved star trek generations
movies,not_removed,we are cloaking what our shields are down fire still one of my favorite movie moments ever
movies,not_removed,wish dennis had gotten a chance to do more of the films hes one of the best trek composers
movies,not_removed,i always really enjoyed this movie maybe because it was one of the first trek movies i saw as a kid so theres the nostalgia factor aside from the stupid bird of prey battle and tested footage i thought it was a very enjoyable movie and touched on some pretty personal things about the characters
movies,not_removed,generations and insurrection work best as twopart tng episodes insurrection in fact was an unused tng twoparter about the only thing the last trek films did right was making the movies big pretty and shiny what we need is a blending of the the tv series stories casting performances and todays special effectsbig movie making only then will we have a truly good star trek movie
movies,not_removed,i love this movie it has my most favorite title sequence of all time
movies,not_removed,i always felt like generations would have been better slimmed down there were too many side plots and resolving them meant that of the movie seemed like the first act plus many of them felt underdeveloped since there wasnt time lots of great scenes though
movies,not_removed,the story i heard was that tng composer ron jones was fired for something rick berman was against mccarthy knew how to play ball despite sneaking in bit of his into early episodes thats why the later seasons of tng didnt have much memorable music save for jay chattaways excellent inner light episode but mccarthy was always great at writing themes such as the theme and generations was a great score with a notsogreat cd release also it didnt help that many jerry goldsmith fans trashed it out of what i can only imagine was jealousy i like to think mccarthys score to generations was a big fuck you to not being allowed to write memorable music during tngs original run
movies,not_removed,soren the klingon sisters and the climactic action scenes enterprise crash and especially the sun explosion were great and i guess the bottle breaking at the hull was cool everything aside from that id say was just kinda lame dont like stewarts overpronounced hammy acting in this one and its only in this movie not in any of the other three or the show the inside of the nexus is kinda lame and everythings generally just kinda lame the holodeck scene with worf was hilarious but the data fails at humor bit is pretty bad even worse than the outrageous okona id say spiner was great in the few angry scenes that he had in this movie but everything else about his antics was dumb and obnoxious and generally speaking what a horrible payoff to the emotions chip arc from the show probably can pass for a pretty ok movie aside from that though
movies,not_removed,i have a soft spot for all the trek films except maybe nemesis that one just sucked but for me generations was the last really good movie of the franchise first contact had fun moments but it was unnecessarily goofy and jerrys music for fc didnt feel like trek music more like leftovers from rudy the first contact of the vulcans scene in particular should have been a touchstone of the whole franchise given its importance and it just felt so cheap and cornball insurrection wouldve been a fine tng episode but as a movie it was kind of flat nemesis was justbad the new ones just dont connect with me ive watched them all hoping for the best and pretty much immediately forgotten about them
movies,not_removed,it is one of the best star trek movies i made a psytrance track with the speech sample in the beginning they say time is the fire in which we burn
movies,not_removed,what is happening in this scene
movies,not_removed,super fast missile whatever why did picard decide to enlist the help of an old fat dead guy
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,im genuinely surprised by how much positivity there is for generations in this thread its not a bad movie it has some powerful individual scenes and strong theming but its still one of the lesser of the trek movies near the bottom from my own perspective the whole thing felt sloppy and disorganized randomly changing uniforms reused footage from one movie earlier tvepisodeesque direction data getting awfully annoying after a while and distracting leaps in logic why didnt the enterprise just unload everything they had on the old bird of prey when that battle started rather than trying to limp away with one or two phaser blasts they even pointed out in dialogue that the gap in firepower was hilariously onesided i think generations would have been an amazing tng twoparter same is true for insurrection as it was it severely needed a better director and more focus its frustrating because there was great stuff in it and it all could have been so much better with a little work
movies,not_removed,nexus
movies,not_removed,all i can think of when watching that is praise the sun
movies,not_removed,really picard had his own storyline going through the remaining tng films growing old and dying without someone to carry on his genetic legacy both common themes starting with generations
movies,not_removed,but because this movie sucks they had to ruin the photo album too by putting those holographic borders around the pictures did they really need to have a space photo album why did they put that on
movies,not_removed,yeah honestly i think this is one of the best trek movies kirk is such a badass and dies a damn hero
movies,not_removed,kirk said he would die alone he died with picard meaning not alone
movies,not_removed,i hear that shatner improved the oh my line it was perfect
movies,not_removed,about as real a death of an iconic character as you could get little fanfare just quiet admiration after a act of bravery and selfsacrifice maybe theres a certain value to it but still it was james kirk the best captain in starfleet history couldnt they have found something better for him to do other than punch an old guy
movies,not_removed,missile equipped with warp just used rocket propulsion to clear the atmosphere yes i am completely making that up but hey it works inuniverse lol
movies,not_removed,its funny you mentioned that i felt the same way too i love generations and it is a bit of a guilty pleasure flick but even it cant break my love that i have for the facts of science no matter how fast that missile traveled to reach that star and destroy it you cant bypass the speed of light and how fast it is emitted to the planet theyd have to wait several minutes to see some disturbance not seconds
movies,not_removed,i agree with you that it felt like the tv show kept going except for one area the lighting it was the first time you actually saw those sets lit in interesting or dramatic ways as compared to sterile tv lighting
movies,not_removed,and mother of pearl and browns and beige and so then worf has a purple space bazooka
movies,not_removed,yeah or go back earlier save robert and rene and then arrest him a few days later when you run into him
movies,not_removed,theres scant few existing trek films that would fulfil your requirements as it is undiscovered country might be the only one if were honest about it wrath of khan as good as it was is a wwii submarine movie journey home was a fish out of water comedy and first contact is a straightup action film
movies,not_removed,insurrection definitely felt like an average tng twoparter
movies,not_removed,insurrection in fact was an unused tng twoparter really maybe it wouldve done a better job explaining why the crews actions were so outofcharacter
movies,not_removed,i have never before watched these but they are hilarious thanks
movies,not_removed,it was a great great movie
movies,not_removed,i love the guy who narrates those
movies,not_removed,i think the people downvoting you have never heard of plinketts angry nerd reviews and are assuming youre just being a dick
movies,not_removed,i too am blown away by the positive comments generations is a turd from start to finish the only good thing it did was destroy the ship from the show so it could be modernized for the next movie
movies,not_removed,what a hack fraud
movies,not_removed,i too watch redlettermedia
movies,not_removed,but how he died was retarded
movies,not_removed,he was basically saying without bones or spock his two best friends kirk was never overtly pedantic as a character
movies,not_removed,that was the dmt kicking in
movies,not_removed,could be worse the original filmed version of his death was just being shot in the back with no last words understandably audiences hated it
movies,not_removed,yes thats plausible but the effects of the missile destroying the star would still take minutes to observe from where they are as that information would not be travelling at warp speeds like the missile was and so the plot hole is still there
movies,not_removed,the technology existed by the cardassians in a missile with warp capability
movies,not_removed,it didnt look like it had a warp drive on it
movies,not_removed,it went to warp
movies,not_removed,but i dont like things that are different
movies,not_removed,it was the first time you actually saw those sets lit in interesting or dramatic ways as compared to sterile tv lighting i guess thats alright but it just looks so different from the way it looked before
movies,not_removed,good point or httpimgurcomaqmwug
movies,not_removed,and i love all of them
movies,not_removed,i never said it was a good unused tng twopart lol
movies,not_removed,no not really if you get a chance read fade in by the late michael piller who wrote the film — its a book about the making of insurrection and its kind of fascinating for legal reasons i think he wasnt allowed to make a profit on it its online for free
movies,not_removed,thatd be weird considering it already takes elements from existing tng episodes
movies,not_removed,thats why i linked the first part
movies,not_removed,they said that on the show
movies,not_removed,how so
movies,not_removed,malcolm macdowell hated both versions actually
movies,not_removed,hmm maybe it was a much smaller star and was therefore much closer to the planet than our sun is
movies,not_removed,but even on earth it takes light what or minutes to reach the earth from the sun dramatic license i dont really care but it is fudging it all a bit even with warp
movies,not_removed,no not really no not really what
movies,not_removed,its rmovies and the arent typically fans of redlettermedia i suspect thats why youve been downvoted
movies,not_removed,yeah im not surprised by that not saying what we got was great either just better than the first one which isnt saying much
movies,not_removed,this wasnt on earth though was was it maybe that star was waaayyy closer to the planet but it was a smaller star so it looked similar
movies,not_removed,no it wasnt really an unused tng twoparter
movies,not_removed,it was not the earth i did double check my math its seconds not minutes so perhaps but still dramatic license and i actually dont mind too much
movies,not_removed,you know what they say hope in one hand shit in the other
movies,not_removed,this story is more than a year old
movies,not_removed,now that the new chris prattchanning tatum version is on the shelf does this mean ghostbusters is essentially dead we see a lot of articles test audiences love ghostbusters every single actor who had a part in the original including ghost man says its great and this movie has eleventy billion views and only negative comments so people should just find friendship trying to convince us to go the best way to convince me to go is announce that the new ghostbusters universe is moving ahead as scheduled and the next film will be and all will be made for and
movies,not_removed,dont clap
movies,not_removed,right and the russo brothers just dropped out recently this article lays out the plan in conjunction with current events where are we sounds dead why hasnt another director picked this up
movies,not_removed,dude cool it
movies,not_removed,im glad jake is gone now i usually avoided videos he was in as i found him insufferable no disrespect to anyone who liked him to each his own i guess but in my honest and humble opinion he is a douchebag﻿
movies,not_removed,very understandable the internship was a bloody disappointment to everyone even googles marketing team owen wilson and vince vaughn did not bring back the magic with this one
movies,not_removed,per imdb it is enochian an occult language recorded in century england
movies,not_removed,ill guess that its origins are wyrd
movies,not_removed,i just assumed it was black speech or whatever
movies,not_removed,full film sitesi
movies,not_removed,oohh its very good if you do end up watching it let me know what your thoughts were
movies,not_removed,shit actually i will delete this and reupload with spoilers tag woops
movies,not_removed,oh come on it wasnt that bad
movies,not_removed,i felt like it was it seemed like almost no effort was put into what should have been the least expensive parts of the movie im all for fun and crazy scifi but this committed one of the worst sins which was being boring
movies,not_removed,snow white ya know which encourages you to give midgets nicknames bo burnham
movies,not_removed,the godfather is basically stand up for yourself and your family no matter what dont let anyone government police or a bigger gang intimidate or belittle you this message makes it better than most mafia movies and lets anyone relate to the corleones and michael but that easily becomes shoot and stab those who stand in your way if theyre weak intimidate them with a horse head okay maybe that was a dark example for a more simple good message avatar respect nature respect the natives ignore technology get off my planet newcomer bitches
movies,not_removed,ratatoullies message is about the relationship between criticism and art and how the world can be afraid of the new but it shouldnt matter if that art speaks to your core twisted though you could argue ego was blinded by nostalgia as that meal brought back memories of him eating the same meal that his mum cooked
movies,not_removed,finding nemo fish are friends not food
movies,not_removed,cinderella teaches us that no matter where you come from no matter how rich you are as long as youre incredibly hot
movies,not_removed,sleeping beauty — consent is implied ← i should add that in the original brothers grimm fairy tale she wakes up because the baby she gave birth to sucked out the thornneedle sb got pregnant because the prince pretty much banged her while she was asleep because the ways of ye old world
movies,not_removed,very cool i always enjoy reading what other filmmakers think about each other it sounds like kubrick and kurosawa are almost universally loved by their peers
movies,not_removed,top read thanks
movies,not_removed,i do wish that current directors were more iconoclastic godard might be a dick but hes damn entertaining to read
movies,not_removed,for me hes just a hoax its empty its not interesting its dead citizen kane which i have a copy of is all the critics darling always at the top of every poll taken but i think its a total bore above all the performances are worthless the amount of respect that movies got is absolutely unbelievable slaying sacred cows good on you bergman
movies,not_removed,this is so interesting to read much more interesting than reading what critics might think of directors imo
movies,not_removed,this is great for rcriterion and rtruefilm its cool to see kurasawa acknowledge naruse the latter is a truly unknown japanese film director
movies,not_removed,luis bunuel ill give him two years more he is just a fashion i think he was pretty spot on there i love how bergman and tarkosvky speaks about one another
movies,not_removed,godard is one of the most influential filmmakers of all time whose films have innovated plenty of now commonplace conventions and hes still making them how could you possibly agree with that statement
movies,not_removed,i agree his movies from the are some of my favourites but that quote is from i think his last very good film is weekend his style in the newer films hasnt influenced anything really look at his films after that they are nothing special very banal
movies,not_removed,i mean mark wallberg used to be known as marky mark im willing to give harry styles a chance
movies,not_removed,oh please like this sub was gonna really criticize a christopher nolan casting choice
movies,not_removed,after seeing nick jonas in kingdom im far more likely to give them a chance
movies,not_removed,people downvote but you have a solid claim
movies,not_removed,claim is he making some sort of articulate argument within his post
movies,not_removed,yeah that the general circlejerk of this sub is a lamprey on nolans little christopher interstellar aside the general consensus ive seen around here is that he can do no wrong
movies,not_removed,interstellar aside what
movies,not_removed,pretty sure the opinion is divided between loving him and hating him there are plenty of bashing posts about him
movies,not_removed,its either a mistake because heath didnt understand the mechanism of the gun or it actually is a masterfully subtle move
movies,not_removed,also his whole speech about how he isnt a planner or a schemer is a lie he starts off by robbing a bank and killing all of his accomplices including the implementation of a scheduled crash and by using their natural greed to make them take each other out he gets himself arrested antagonizes guards and then blows the place with a bomb hed planted in another cellmate he deliberately switches the locations he tells batman ensuring no matter what choice batman makes it will be the wrong one he sets captured guards up to look like his clown goons and almost makes gcpd snipers kill innocents while ambushing them in one play hes full of shit the entire movie and its amazing
movies,not_removed,movies never get guns right this could easily be that
movies,not_removed,i dont think he really did that heard the picture just paused while he pulled up the gun
movies,not_removed,pretty sure that was just a safety precaution during filming so some actor didnt get his head blown off for the sake of a movie it pains me to add this but s
movies,not_removed,my favorite heath ledger movie of all time
movies,not_removed,ive never seen someone bring that up before good eye man say what you will about nolan or anyone in this scene but when theyre on point theyre on fucking point
movies,not_removed,you are all retarded
movies,not_removed,its none
movies,not_removed,i dont know harvey dent demonstrated he had some experience with firearms in his first scene in the courtroom with the hostile witness i doubt he would have been fooled if the joker really wanted to there would have been better ways of making sure a gun did not fire or did not kill him he brought at least two guns into that room the silenced glock at the beginning and the revolver with a hammer so there was the capacity for a better deception if he so chose i feel he kept his finger on the hammer at the beginning to prevent dent from ending the jokers plea early even if dent killed him it would supposedly still setup the transformation from dent to two face by allowing the perversion of justice allowing gothams white knight to fall down the path of chaotic revenge doing greater damage than the joker alone could have managed
movies,not_removed,i just found out by reddit a couple days ago but apparently he set himself up to be caught by the police at the notice j kerr
movies,not_removed,i remember when he tells the second story about how he got those scars and i thought oh my god this is brilliant there is no answer thats the answer i feel like i got the ledgernolan joker in that moment when hes hanging upside down literally the inverse of batman and hes swinging there smiling and says i think you and i are destined to do this forever i concluded this is the greatest film villain of all time it will never be topped i mean they are going to be doing it forever batman and the joker will be doing this for as long as our culture tells stories
movies,not_removed,i think i read an article somewhere discussing the movie and it mentioned that heath ledgers joker is a pathological liar and not one word coming out of his mouths can be trusted
movies,not_removed,i noticed this while watching the movie for the nth time the joker in tdk is a master manipulator knowing nolan i kinda doubt this little detail wasnt part of the script the mild twist here is the movie giving an impression that the joker is a psychopath troll bent on chaos when he really is a calculating puppeteer him changing stories about how he gets his scar shows how hed use lies for effects and to provoke reactions
movies,not_removed,it is not sure why people think putting your finger on the hammer would stop it either the finger would need to be blocking the hammer not just on it unless the joker has the strongest grip on earth and can stop the sideways moving hammer by squeezing on it degrees
movies,not_removed,is is that sarcasm in any way
movies,not_removed,number one rule of film making with fire arms is to treat every gun as if it is real and loaded
movies,not_removed,he had his finger on the hammer throughout most of it especially after the coin toss
movies,not_removed,besides when he takes his finger off to distract dent dent turns his head to think and he puts it right back on the hammer its all right there
movies,not_removed,a lot of people think he was military because of the gun salute scene but this is good evidence that nolans joker is a former member of gcpd
movies,not_removed,its as if everything he says is a joke
movies,not_removed,i mean everything he says is a lie so its pretty easy to put that together how many different stories does he give for the origin of his scars
movies,not_removed,the joker cant be trusted
movies,not_removed,number one rule of with fire arms
movies,not_removed,felt sure that he wont shoot because hes tallking thats some reckless way of giving someone the illusion of choice
movies,not_removed,that cant possibly be true
movies,not_removed,so youre saying that he is some kind of comedian
movies,not_removed,shit
movies,not_removed,i see the stories of the scars to explicitly frame this aspect of the joker
movies,not_removed,wrong number one rule if you have fire arms in most situations is to stop drop and roll
movies,not_removed,no youre thinking of the comedian
movies,not_removed,exactly
movies,not_removed,youve done it again holmes
movies,not_removed,im not sure what youre arguing for mate the post i was disproving implies that the joker was relying on mechanical means not psychological
movies,not_removed,sounds pretty solid to me
movies,not_removed,lol
movies,not_removed,so no discussion not a text why you like this scene nothing
movies,not_removed,thats impossible no its necessary god that scene gives me chills every time and the score in the sequence is amazing and one of my favourite pieces of cinematic music dont care what people say about the movie now but interstellar is one of the few movies that after it was over i needed to take a minute to collect myself pretty overwhelming
movies,not_removed,the acting was just phenomenal and some of the scenes were emotionally very strong i think the musician was born out of troys first marriage or affair definitely not roses son
movies,not_removed,i think hes a character whose life didnt go as he wanted it to and is living under illusions he tells himself to make his life more tolerable he had good bad qualities like most of us and the movie doesnt want to portray him as good or bad just complex
movies,not_removed,i respected troy as much as i hated him denzel was phenomenal
movies,not_removed,theres a discussion thread
movies,not_removed,i want my own
movies,not_removed,i want my own
movies,not_removed,the engineers very well could have just discovered the xeno nothing states that they created them they also created murals etc and seem to be opposed to the humans unnatural synthetic creations this would lend to them having found rather than manufactured the xenomorph
movies,not_removed,while i greatly dislike prometheus its not clear that they created the alien there are sculptures of them in the temple and the jockey in the original film had been there long enough to fossilize which means the aliens existed long before the events of prometheus which makes that quasi alien at the end even cheaper dumber fan service
movies,not_removed,im still more pissed off about how terrible alien resurrection was i couldve done without resurrection
movies,not_removed,preach brother
movies,not_removed,i would also like to recommend yesterdays review of the film from the same website it is not surprising that this submission was downvoted so quickly without anyone offering a counterpoint it cannot be done a very noticeable trend has emerged as laid out in each of these articles the democratic party has solidified themselves as an agency of racialist reaction under the guise of progress
movies,not_removed,i was pretty baffled when i checked rotten tomatoes and imdb and saw the low ratings this from sites that routinely give avengers movies ratings the movie has definitely unsettled the film critic crowd and the rest of the identity politics social layera politically confused self absorbed lot on their best days and the reasons why are clear as walsh points out in this passage many black youth moving to the left in the read e franklin fraziers black bourgeoisie eagerly and with great interest in the book frazier a sociologist offered a critical analysis of the aspiring black middle class as the university of missouri press comments the book met with mixed reviews and harsh criticism from the black middle and professional class yet frazier stood solidly by his argument that the black middle class was marked by conspicuous consumption wish fulfillment and a world of makebelieve oh what a field day he would have in our time in fairness the discussion section of free state has been much more open and honest than the film reviews and dishonest commentary from the identity politics bloggerscolumnists etc i cant wait to see it
movies,not_removed,robert rodriguez bought the rights and may make a tv series about it nothing too specific like a release date or any more details yet
movies,not_removed,oh god
movies,not_removed,yeah id like it to stay as a film have distinct stories being told with different animation styles why buy the rights to something and do something completely different to it even more weirdly why buy the rights and do nothing with it
movies,not_removed,i think you might have intended this for another subreddit rather than rmovies
movies,not_removed,it takes a hero to overcome prejudice
movies,not_removed,i agree with your sentiment i too found deckard to be the protagonist not the hero though
movies,not_removed,i saw this movie when it came out read the book and saw it a bunch more times over the years this does not mean my opinion is more valid than yours but it means i have given it some thought like you have and while parts of the book were not in the movie many other parts were taken from the book verbatimleons test rachels interview i never felt deckard used rachel as an object i felt he genuinely loved her which would require treating her as a human and as for roy he was one of the villains for certain calling him the protagonist is revisionism of the worst kind as for the part about deckard himself being a replicanti am going to have to come around to that on my own given the fact that a sequel is arriving in a year or so i will be giving it some views and some thought interesting side points about roy batty one in the book his name was spelled with t two in the book he was a pharmacist
movies,not_removed,if you liked deckards character in blade runner definitely read the book blade runners deckard is like a diet antihero hes still got some grit but hollywood cleans up deckard quite a bit to fit ridleys rewritten plot its one of the biggest differences between the book and movie people who see the movie think deckard is a protagonisthero or think the exact opposite its very black and white in the book the reader comes away with a lot more certainty that deckard is an antihero its because dick explores the gray spaces of morality with deckard and roys characters in the books more thoroughly the movie encourages the viewer to walk away seeing roy in a heroic light let me tell you right now that the book challenges the readers view on roy far more in fact you feel both roy and deckards ruthlessness much more on the pages theres much more gray morality and far less hes the good guy hes the bad guy lines in the sand that are drawn the book really leaves the decision up to the viewer over whether or not roy and deckard are hero and villain the movie seems to spell it out in bold font underlined roy is a hero by the finale far more ambiguous in the book treats the reader intelligently all of what i said is a debatable opinion but trust me when i claim this movie deckard is less ruthless and more dumb than his book counterpart so if youre a deckard fan i cant recommend do androids dream of electric sheep enough
movies,not_removed,roy says kinship or something to that effect when he saves deckard he just didnt want to watch another fellow replicant die again because unicorns
movies,not_removed,ridley scott in a recent interview hinted that deckard actually was a replicant
movies,not_removed,yes ive heard thats what i was referring to apparently there were hints too subtle for me i guess
movies,not_removed,it wasnt much of a hint he said something like of course he is
movies,not_removed,it follows was one pf my fav thrillers in recent years the cinematography was pretty great
movies,not_removed,hope its not as bad as it follows
movies,not_removed,and i hope its as good
movies,not_removed,can we not start our submissions with can we talk about
movies,not_removed,the main theme from that movie is one of my absolute favorites all of the music is beautiful really although it is a strange war movie where much of the action is abstracted away
movies,not_removed,the main theme from that movie is one of my absolute favorites i know its incredible what i want to know is how they did it did they really just find two hills a ways apart and shoot a bunch of illumination flares and tracer rounds at them i suspect a lot of it was done with miniatures the attack on especially
movies,not_removed,hmm maybe miniatures was the approach the tracers in the film are incredible
movies,not_removed,no incredible is that panning shot with all the artillery shells detonating on a hill and then following a plane taking off that was they had to actually fire a shit ton of explosives around a flying plane
movies,not_removed,haha i reckon they were blank shells and rigged explosives but badass none the less
movies,not_removed,this is a great point in other pixar movies the theme is connected to the story in finding nemo clown fish are a good choice because they are protective and territorial marlin exemplifies this behavior in his fear of leaving the anemone walle being a robot draws a stark contrast between the humanity of the robot and robotic actions of the human characters toy story explores self knowledge humility and dedication to another in a way only toys can in the subsequent movies they deal with loss of innocence as the owner grows up and the toys stay toys the theme adds depth to the story and allows pixar to explore something in a new and illuminating way the good dinosaur feels shallow it is an interesting role reversal between human and animal but this doesnt lead to anything it is the definition of a gimmick
movies,not_removed,this immediately makes me think of one of the most ridiculous lines of the movie when sam elliott trex goes lets ride as one of the guys in puts it ride what
movies,not_removed,but then we have to watch these childish renderings go on a hard comingofage journey it was really jarring like the land before time
movies,not_removed,so the hook is supposed to be boy and his dog with reversed roles but its not at all the dinosaur behaves exactly like a human and the human behaves exactly like a dog the entire time its nothing new
movies,not_removed,but then we have to watch these childish renderings go on a hard comingofage journey i must say i absolutely love this aspect it feels very much like childrens story books aesthetics to me that fluorescent green speck that looks like a childs doodle over a backgroung of unsaturated muddy colors has really become an iconic contrast to me the reall issue to me was the writing it was really unsubtle way too heavy handed with its direction and message and as a whole very unimaginative it was a first time director which makes me think that he had a few things he reaaaaally wanted to direct which came out great or unique and to fill in the blanks he resorted to common story structures but the whole idea of them being dinosaurs once you get over the ridiculous proposition doesnt really bother me sure once you start rationalizing things then a lot of it wont make sense but im not sure if youre supposed to the movies focus is the emotional ride and the whole coming of age aspect and in those aspects it does suffer immensely but from a lackluster script not the fact that its dinosaurs the whole thing about dinosaurs being able to plant crops is just contextual stuff if the movie tells you it can happen then it can happen
movies,not_removed,side note too why the hell did they waste the time and resources raising chickens they didnt eat them and they had no use for the eggs
movies,not_removed,they made this movie because they wanted to showcase how great there natural animation was im guessing the animation team showed the higher ups what they could do and the higher ups were like thats awesome make a movie around it so you get this lame story that you can see with any other movie about a boy and his dog the animation was fantastic and the story just felt like it was a rush job
movies,not_removed,took my kids to see it and spent the whole time wondering where the brother and sister went they just disappeared
movies,not_removed,toy story explores self knowledge humility and dedication to another in a way only toys can i agree with your overall point but im not sure what this means
movies,not_removed,i almost kinda feel like they werent dinosaurs in the script and then they just added a few roars and shit i know the entire movie was recast at one point and plagued with production issues
movies,not_removed,pixar has an exhibit at the science center in los angeles and they also put out a book detailing the painstaking design process and historical references behind each character in their best movies you can see the mid century modern styles they transposed over inside out and monsters inc for example its amazing the way they agonize over making anger be the perfect type of square or rectangle this is all supposed to serve the story and convey meaning before someone even opens their mouth i cant imagine they did any of that high level design for good dinosaur or even cars
movies,not_removed,exactly making those ranchers trexes doesnt help that whole subplot at all id much rather just see them just animate a cg sam elliott
movies,not_removed,that goes over a lot better though because those dinos live in their natural habitat and it really was a forbidding dangerous place
movies,not_removed,speaking strictly about the character animation style relationship to the story i think land before time works better because littlefoot or ducky are not nearly as simplified as the good dinosaur yes both could easily be found in a coloring book but many of the characters in tgd look like straight up kid doodles come to life the characters are extremely simplified while the western world and themes are not at all but to be honest i find it hard to defend lbt i love that movie but i havent seen it in years in my mind the fact the proportions of the dinosaurs are mostly correct matches the coming of age tale much better than tgd but i dont trust my grade film critique enough to make any claims too bold
movies,not_removed,this was exactly my problem with the movie i thought the whole point of the boy and dog story was leading to the humans and dinosaurs living together at the end fundamentally changing how their societies worked and helping each other to survivebut nope nothing changed
movies,not_removed,youre right anything is possible in a movie but id argue that its the filmmakers job to try as hard as they can to convince us too its equally as ridiculous that the insects in a bugs life can have a functioning society that dinosaurs could but i feel like a lot more effort was made in that movie to draw parallels between the real nature of each species of insect the ants are a tightly knit social society the grasshoppers have a sort of locusty plague thing going on the caterpillar is looking forward to a later stage in life and the whole thing is about realizing that just because you feel small and insignificant like a bug doesnt mean you cant sway in the world in a real way having all the characters as bugs elevates the story so it makes me want to believe it more making characters in a coming of age western into dinosaurs seems a lot more arbitrary to me i could name a few connections but they seem a lot thinner and less necessary and id go so far as to say its actually a hindrance
movies,not_removed,from the perspective of a toy the kid is his entire universe he gives him a home validation and meaning and theyll continue to depend on that for the toys entire lives i think he means that you cant recreate the toykid relationship as humans without getting into weird clingy borderline slavery territory plus you can layer on old toynew toy friction and lots of nostalgia i cant think of anything else that could pull that dichotomy of nearly as well and efficiently as making the characters all toys all great stuff that the good dinosaur didnt achieve with making their characters dinosaurs
movies,not_removed,toys represent everything we want that does not exist space rangers cowboys dinosaurs superheroes etc nobody has a toy of a real firefighter with all the problems his reality brings they have toys of super awesome firefighters with futuristic equipment the amount of creative knowledge that they have of what could be is incredible toys cannot express themselves they do not have the capability of expressing anything we impart our will upon them to make them be what we know they are they are the definition of humility whenever andy is present the toys stop any and all expression to better take on the personality andy personifies them with by playing with them moving them and speaking for them toys will never leave you theyll never find new friends or change their identity against your will that was the whole point of the toy story series was that you might leave your toys behind but theyll always be yours until you make them someone elses even when they break and fall apart the personalities we give them endure to attempt to make us happy theyre dedicated to you as much as an inanimate object can be
movies,not_removed,someday i hope to be as wise as a toy the dalai lama
movies,not_removed,haha this makes me think of a nightmare situation where youve been animating this coming of age western for months and then a maniac director kicks the door in and yells stop the work theyre all dinosaurs now
movies,not_removed,i get it that dinosaurs and their culture werent well contextualized in the movie or werent justified enough as a choice so i understand that it just comes off as a pointless or arbitrary addition to the movie but the biggest problem is that theyre interchangable it could be lions people bugs aliens whatever and this problem again comes down to an unimaginative bare minimum script dinosaurs by themselves are not the actual issue so i dont agree that theyre the worst part of the movie they do seem arbitrary but its not like the movie would improve with humans or whatever else
movies,not_removed,this thank you for expressing this
movies,not_removed,i see what youre saying i disagree in that i think making them humans would make it better but agree that it is far from the only thing holding this movie back from greatness the script is weak in a lot of places i like the over all idea of the movie a lot boy and his dog trying to make it home in the old west even though theres some lazy writing scenetoscene i guess what i mean is if i was submit a list of things to improve the film it would start with lose the dinosaurs then begin addressing the other script issues
movies,not_removed,man involved in and paid for project speaks highly of said project news at
movies,not_removed,blues brothers was a hit amirite or what
movies,not_removed,given the language hes using i cant help but feel that hes pandering i plan on seeing the movie anyway but its still an unnecessary thing to do
movies,not_removed,again just gonna leave this here
movies,not_removed,does dan aykroyd realize that he is an ad
movies,not_removed,james cameron praised terminator genysis so
movies,not_removed,he was paid to
movies,not_removed,believe it or not no down voting on my part i dont really see the point of it just wanted to share the opinion of one of the stars of the original
movies,not_removed,looks like sony is patrolling this post
movies,not_removed,ive read clarkes entire series several times watched the movie and also have watched interstellar several times they are completely unrelated
movies,not_removed,short answer no longer answer nope absoutely not
movies,not_removed,no
movies,not_removed,interstellar isnt a continuation of but i dont think it can be denied that interstellar is in many ways a reworking of the same ideas present in they both deal with an alien presence of some kind which may or may not be future humans manipulating time in some way both feature a spectacular docking sequence both question what it means to be human and what it takes to grow and evolve into our next state of consciousness part of the reason i am not a huge fan of interstellar is because i liked all these ideas better back when did them the first time that being said i give interstellar an and a so i wouldnt say this is a problem with either film i do not however believe the films to be connected or exist in the same film universe there would simply be no benefit to that and frankly i dont think that nolan being the type of filmmaker that he is would attempt to touch a kubrick film in any way
movies,not_removed,one person explained why they dont agree and they havent even seen space odyssey their explanation made no sense because he was taking all the sci fi tropes of the two movies and using them to disestablish their correlation tropes that i didnt even use to relate them to eachother in the first place and a subject that has absolutely nothing to do with this discussion as for the other person he just said that he read the books and disagreed to which i responded that the books really dont have anything to do with the movie which is a known fact that ridley scott specifically himself has specifically said he never gave a reason to why he disagreed im encouraging discussion which is something im not getting just people who are really deadset on telling me no im not sure why you called me a pseudointellectual i just want to talk about what i posted about
movies,not_removed,sorry i tried my best i wanted to word it in a way that makes it not sound definitive and that my suggestion could be scrutinized in some manners but still work in a way
movies,not_removed,i have read the book as well i share the opinion with everyone who has seen the film and read the book that the film and book are two completely separate entities rendering clarkes series into the realm of red herring pertaining to this discussion the point of the post is to discuss specific elements of the film that render my theory completely impossible
movies,not_removed,if you want to know why he called you a pseudo intellectual its because you are using a lot of words and not actually saying anything no bad thing as its part of developing your thinking but that is why when someone raises a perfectly pertinent objection there really is only the fact that nolan was obviously influenced by that points towards any connection the connection is in the real world through artistic influence rather than a direct film relationship and you just seem to steamroll ahead without taking them into consideration saying a lot without ever addressing the core of the issue
movies,not_removed,go to a psychiatrist
movies,not_removed,okay thanks
movies,not_removed,care to elaborate sure they are general but what are the details that stop it from possibly being nolans intentions interstellar includes higher forms of human beings the homage of the wormhole being at jupiter arguably in the same place the monolith was higher humans building machines to help humankind and even share similar themes theres a lot more than the film being in the same genre that connect the two together
movies,not_removed,will do
movies,not_removed,have you even watched space odyssey i say that because the whole first act is about humans learning to use toolsand you havent structinized anything other than my grammar
movies,not_removed,i wasnt saying that part was unique to the movie though thats part of the timeline i posted because it happens in space odyssey that part of my post are all events that happen in the movies i never said that ancestors learning to use tools was a quality that linked them together that doesnt even happen in interstellar in my comment above i stated there is more than just the two movie being in the same genre linking them together all the similarities i listed you have yet to refute and nolan has said specifically that space odyssey had tremendous impact on his film but never specifically stated just how far that inspiration goes there is certainly insurmountable evidence linking the two films together and that wasnt something i was even planning to discuss because its common knowledge to fans of both films the spiritual sequel aspect would be nothing more than an easter egg a fan theory of sorts what i was planning to discuss are specific details within both movies that make the two universes incompatible something that you have yet to actually say anything about as a huge fan of both films and also having seen them dozens of times myself i havent noticed anything that strictly rules this out as a possibility hence why i posted this to get more insight and i dont mean to be a dick but have you really seen you just said it wasnt a event yet youve seen it a dozen times it seems like you would know the context of that summary had you actually seen the film
movies,not_removed,next time you should actually come in to a post with the tag discussion actually prepared to discuss something instead of nitpick the grammar of my title and comments you havent listed any reasons that make my premise flawed other than list things that you comprehended incorrectly and repeatedly tell me that my theory about a movie youve never seen is wrong for no good reason cheers
movies,not_removed,i posted it with no link because the sub doesnt allow you to also you clearly havent seen space odyssey and came in here like a condescending douche telling me off about a movie you havent even watched you said man discovering tools isnt a space odyssey event thats literally minutes worth of the movie you havent seen the film a dozen times you havent even watched it once so quit your bullshit your entire argument is you taking sci fi tropes that i never even used to compare the two films in the first place to deprive their correlation a correlation established by the director himself and then misrepresenting my argument by talking about something else as for the book it is redherring because the film is an adaptation and many many many things have been changed ridley scott himself has talked about the differences between the two and how this is his own interpretation of the book with a completely different ending the film is beyond different from the novel and i think its perfectly rational to put it in a universe of its own nolan did not use the book as inspiration he used the film the sequel is directed by someone else and more adequately portrays clarkes novels kubrick had nothing to do with this film and never envisioned a sequel to his own christopher nolan had zero inspiration from that film but even then its events that all happened after everything i listed here as my post says the events in interstellar would interlace between the unaccounted for millions of years between when humans learned to use tools and when they are fullon inhabiting space so that also has nothing to do with anything and doesnt add anything to your argument i posted your comment because you came into this thread full of shit ready to shit on me before ever being ready to discuss shit you nitpick my title nitpick my grammar and an hour later still havent come up with jack shit im looking for details in each movie something you cant provide because you havent seen one of them so have a good one dude
movies,not_removed,i confused the director but yeah you still really havent said much thanks anyways
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,is it still live action if all the animals are cgi a la the jungle book
movies,not_removed,i guess you cant call it liveaction if there is no humans in it
movies,not_removed,lion is overated due to disney trying to milk every movie criticsfake auto bot reviews are going to give high ratings musicals suck and annoying its all about story not a dance number
movies,not_removed,reddit post
movies,not_removed,musicals can suck just like any other movie
movies,not_removed,i remember when i was
movies,not_removed,im not sure i get what youre getting at its fairly obvious that they take place in the real world hell the third one makes it a massive plot point that julia roberts looks like julia roberts
movies,not_removed,are you serious how many actors actually play themselves in movies set in the real world i thought it was interesting
movies,not_removed,wow conspiritard the movie from forewarned films
movies,not_removed,was hoping id see some testosterone filled alex jones action
movies,not_removed,if only it was a snuff film
movies,not_removed,noooooooooottt forewarned films theses guys improperly used our company name and our trademark and we had to get lawyers involved to get them to stop
movies,not_removed,wow sorry for perpetuating what those fuckwads did to you good luck
movies,not_removed,it has more laughs and more scares than the first films take it with a grain of salt he is an executive producer on the film
movies,not_removed,lol nice try
movies,not_removed,thats like steve jobs reviewing the iphone kinda hard to accept thats hes not being biased
movies,not_removed,dan aykroyd also believes ghosts are real
movies,not_removed,well he is old maybe he thinks the first two movies were actually scary now
movies,not_removed,he wouldnt be alone a bunch of people seem to think theyre horror movies
movies,not_removed,wwwyoutubecomuserashubhais
movies,not_removed,again you literally just posted this
movies,not_removed,as long as they are not messing up with the movie just to make it shorter i dont really mind
movies,not_removed,i have an uneasy feeling that the only reason they want to shorten the film for theaters is so that they can rake in the cash later by making directors cut extended cut rerelease with minutes of extra footage type releases on paid for media dvd digital downloads etc
movies,not_removed,the taxi scene is bonkers
movies,not_removed,its great the way it plays with audience expectations heavy spoilers incoming for the first minutes its a totally generic story of a cop on the edge blurring the line between good and evil to rescue his kidnapped wife then his wife is dead ok then it shifts into the story of a cop on the edge blurring the line between good and evil to capture his wifes killer then he captures the guy before the movies halfway point and lets him go what the fuck is going on
movies,not_removed,fantastic movie it really spirals out of control south korea has been killing it in horrorthrillers of the last few years
movies,not_removed,this movie is great it has the veneer of a classy thriller movie but its complete shlock for about minutes of its run time its really good if you dont mind some gory stuff
movies,not_removed,i saw the devil was one of those movies that just left me sitting there with an open mouth and thinking about what id just witnessed i didnt even notice how the time passed but i started some time in the night and suddenly it was morning and my only regret was that the movie set the bar higher for future films really really strong movie and one of my all time favorites
movies,not_removed,the wrench to the nads still gives me cold sweats
movies,not_removed,camping is intense
movies,not_removed,ive had my eye on thatun for a while but never got around to watching it my man thoroughly recommended it to me which helps we tend to agree on films so ive got faith
movies,not_removed,i also watched i saw the devil this year and i agree it was great mr vengeance was great oldboy was fantastic but ms vengeance was a bit weird and weak imo but what i loved even more was a great movie about someone who just spoiler also some good korean movies i saw recently
movies,not_removed,this is one of my alltime favorite movies it is a hard one to recommend given its graphic nature but holy hell is it a brilliant thriller glad you enjoyed it as well
movies,not_removed,there is also the film the chasers and mother both very excellent korean thrillers twisted dark and tragic i recommend those ab d everything else mentioned here
movies,not_removed,if you want violence and good plots korean movies are the way to go
movies,not_removed,you should watch other korean thrillers theyre incredible i dont know what it is but they are so good with atmosphere and tone the wailing the handmaiden memories of murder the yellow sea confessions of murder the chaser the man from nowhere a bittersweet life
movies,not_removed,watched this for the first time a couple weeks ago with some friends i absolutely love the dark crimefilled underworld this movie sets up i just loved everything about it
movies,not_removed,i really liked this movie all i gotta say is damn that guy heals really fast
movies,not_removed,this is the movie that turned me onto korean films now ive seen like every one netflix has really awesome movie though probably my favorite twist on the revenge genre that i have seen
movies,not_removed,yep hectic also the cannibal guy and his partner were freaky
movies,not_removed,yep the vengeance trilogy was brilliant i want to see more of these type of movies know any others
movies,not_removed,i usually just sleep in my car
movies,not_removed,interesting
movies,not_removed,will do just have to find them first
movies,not_removed,i would like to think he wasnt human the human can handle only so much pain
movies,not_removed,i would recommend goksung the wailing its on netflix and its very intense
movies,not_removed,i saw the devil is better in directors cut and i recommend you killers
movies,not_removed,check out the chaser and the yellow sea both are terrific
movies,not_removed,have you seen memories of murder you probably have but in the off chance check it out its so good
movies,not_removed,try no mercy
movies,not_removed,not quite a crime thriller as this but the wailing was a phenomenal movie that id highly recommend if you havent seen it i also really enjoyed black house
movies,not_removed,this film has one of the best endings i have ever seen
movies,not_removed,i feel that killers and the recently released headshot both by the same directors are way too long and could really use some editing
movies,not_removed,i think i watched the directors cut
movies,not_removed,no but will check it out
movies,not_removed,the longer the better

movies,not_removed,my money is on shai halud
movies,not_removed,i hope that arena has a strict no chanting policy or beetlejuice is gonna have a really rough go of it
movies,not_removed,where is sandy with her alaskan bull worm
movies,not_removed,we are so due a dune remake
movies,not_removed,someone walked with a lot of rhythm
movies,not_removed,thats fucking awesome all three of these creatures scared the hell out of me when i was little four if you include kevin bacon
movies,not_removed,may his passing cleanse the world
movies,not_removed,can someone help me beetlejuice dune and
movies,not_removed,if you zoom far out enough the arena where the race is held is actually on the back of another sand worm
movies,not_removed,nice fuckin model
movies,not_removed,ive always wondered how the worms in beetlejuice work is the outer worm just some kind of shell and the inner worm the real deal or is it one creature or what
movies,not_removed,kevin bacon looks fucking triumphant
movies,not_removed,technically one of those is a graboid
movies,not_removed,slightly disappointed this doesnt have boba fett riding the sarlacc
movies,not_removed,i think when one worm could swallow dozens of the other worms in one go there isnt much of a contest the maker should also have more teeth
movies,not_removed,the giant dune sandworms still give me chills
movies,not_removed,this is absolutely great
movies,not_removed,scooby doo
movies,not_removed,i hate em mself
movies,not_removed,its an alaskan bull worm
movies,not_removed,where is the thresher maw
movies,not_removed,looks like a bunch of penii
movies,not_removed,now thats worm racing
movies,not_removed,stampede earl stampeeeeede
movies,not_removed,that one guy in the back is making up for something
movies,not_removed,wtf where can i buy this i need this
movies,not_removed,whoever wins the race that audience is about to lose
movies,not_removed,this reminds me of that sponge bob episode with sandy and patrick
movies,not_removed,now this is podracing
movies,not_removed,at first i thought there was a giant cloud but instead it was a giant giant gargantuan worm with a tiny banana of a human for scale
movies,not_removed,thats kevin bacon riding that shit fo sho
movies,not_removed,needs more nausicaa imo
movies,not_removed,i would go kevin bacon tremors style versus michael keaton beetlejuice style
movies,not_removed,missing the one from spongebob
movies,not_removed,what is roland deschain doing on a graboid
movies,not_removed,i thought that was han solo riding an
movies,not_removed,can we get hbo to make a dune series after game of thrones expires
movies,not_removed,i never forget the creepy stopmotion animation used in films like beetlejuice forget cgi for horror stopmotion is way more terrifying
movies,not_removed,there is only one
movies,not_removed,bless the maker and all his water bless the coming and going of him may his passing cleanse the world may he keep the world for his people
movies,not_removed,for he is the kwisatz haderach
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,especially since it could just swallow the other racers
movies,not_removed,give him a donkey he shall win
movies,not_removed,my money is on the giant tortilla looking shit in the back
movies,not_removed,set your body ablaze
movies,not_removed,depends on things is there a water hazard thinking triathlon here is the worm required to be intact when it passes the finish line because that worm nuke could totally blow spice over the line before any other pieces of the other worms could make it there
movies,not_removed,heee eeee eeee eeee eeeyyy
movies,not_removed,my first thought
movies,not_removed,its big scary and pink
movies,not_removed,they are there just too tiny to see
movies,not_removed,i mean there was the scifi miniseries that was pretty good a while back the movie well its a classic but it hasnt aged well it practically screams and it doesnt hold to the book very well
movies,not_removed,hollywood wont make it because people want it theyre too bust rebooting the last man standing
movies,not_removed,modern costume design pacing and cgi would work wonders for it just as long as they have a good script writer no internal monologues please
movies,not_removed,i can see peter jackson directing
movies,not_removed,did you know that sting was supposed to hang dong in the speedo scene but producers scrapped it i think they may have even shot it already
movies,not_removed,alejandro jodorowsky is alivetheres still time
movies,not_removed,i think therell be controversies if they remake dune
movies,not_removed,i think christopher walken is to blame
movies,not_removed,and now you finally understand why you felt that fearful giddiness at the sight of kevin bacon in tight jeans and chaps
movies,not_removed,tremors
movies,not_removed,kevin bacon as valentine mckee
movies,not_removed,kevin bacons prostate
movies,not_removed,graboids
movies,not_removed,tremors i think
movies,not_removed,seriously
movies,not_removed,you forgot the honk honk
movies,not_removed,its beetlejuice we aint gotta explain shit
movies,not_removed,its like a xenomorphs inner jaw
movies,not_removed,can you fly you sucka can you flyyyyyyy
movies,not_removed,this picture makes me happyi think youve isolated the cause
movies,not_removed,and another is shai huludbless his coming and going doesnt mean theyre not still sand worms
movies,not_removed,sarlacc isnt a worm though its a stationary creature that feeds on whatever comes near it in fact the one we all know is a female the smaller males are parasites and attach themselves to the larger females underground
movies,not_removed,as they should
movies,not_removed,me too buddy
movies,not_removed,shaihalud
movies,not_removed,ya hya chouhada
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,usul we have wormsign the likes of which even god has never seen
movies,not_removed,whats going on
movies,not_removed,so is patricks belly button but that dont scare me neither
movies,not_removed,yeah i loved the miniseries i often wish they did the next book god emperor great dialog but the base concept may have been too silly for tv
movies,not_removed,i especially liked their take on the dune messiah first part of children of dune miniseries the miniseries had severe problems though acting was subpar all those czech actors with thick accents special effects were mostly awful and there was no sand because they filmed it in prague children of dune was a bit better but i really didnt like the casting changes apart from stilgar who i could imagine as an older bald version of the previous stilgar some part were played perfectly though paul baron harkonnen alia chani leto ii
movies,not_removed,do you mean the movie that is basically a word for word replication of the book with a couple of dramatic and bizarre changes
movies,not_removed,which is a remake of
movies,not_removed,as the last woman standing with an all female cast
movies,not_removed,i am waiting for them do do a full i robotwar z on it make a completely unrelated movie and slap dune by frank herbert on it
movies,not_removed,no hollywood wont make it because the first one didnt make dick for money so neither would a new one thats the way hollywood thinks
movies,not_removed,i think hollywood wont remake it becuase they are afraid of a script with a word jihad in it
movies,not_removed,okay buddy hollywood will jump on anything with even the slightest hint of nostalgia associated with it
movies,not_removed,and if it is a success well get a trilogy based on the terminology of the empire
movies,not_removed,the only one who would make it long enough to fit everything that was in the books but he would remove some of the best parts and change them to running around
movies,not_removed,thundergun in spaaaaaaaace
movies,not_removed,what controversy
movies,not_removed,it cant be that hard to believe someone hasnt seen tremors ive heard of it at least
movies,not_removed,i also didnt recognize it and i loved tremors i thought it was cowgirl on a picture riding robotic worm and i though some kind of a brave star character i never heard off saddle confused me
movies,not_removed,in beetlejuice work its beetlejuice beetlejuice
movies,not_removed,they are indeed all worms and they all reside in sand so sandworms this man is technically correct the best kind of correct
movies,not_removed,lol my bad ever since i was a kid my natural reaction is to call it a worm
movies,not_removed,queue toto song
movies,not_removed,i think god emperor was the book where it kinda jumped the shark dune messiah children were all pretty good but progressively notasgood through the trilogy children starts to suffer from hey remember this thing that has always been in this world but that i just mentioned for the first time right now but god emperor was where it really got over the top tbh thats as far as i made it i tried to read heretics and got like chapters in before i gave up
movies,not_removed,i honestly didnt mind the acting i liked children of dune as well the production value was kinda subpar but still
movies,not_removed,i uh what no weirding modules were made up for the movie for starters
movies,not_removed,i dont know about the last man standing but last man standing is a remake of a fistful of dollars but reset in prohibition era dust bowl town controlled by two rival rumrunners a fistful of dollars is of course a remake of yojimbo but reset in a wild west frontier town controlled by two rival gangs yojimbo is not a remake its set in a medieval japanese village ruled by two rival houses the warrior and the sorceress is a remake of a fistful of dollars but set in a barbarian city ruled by two rival warlords it stars david carradine im sure someone has done a scifi remake as well and theres probably a postapocalyptic version as well edit ah hah knew it omega doom is yojimbo set in a postapocalyptic ruined city ruled by two rival gangs of murderous robots thats a twofer
movies,not_removed,ｆｕｃｋ ｇｈｏｓｔｂｕｓｔｅｒｓ
movies,not_removed,if it has lots of sandworm action then im down
movies,not_removed,lynchs version was kinda like that jodorowskis would have been even more
movies,not_removed,could you pay me in dick please
movies,not_removed,im expecting at least a trilogy of trilogies
movies,not_removed,if they release a new dune movie in this decade people who did not know dune will get the wrong idea of what dune is trying to promote example these people will think that dune promotes islamic terrorism because theres the word jihad in the movie and they think that the motives of the fedaykinfremen is similar to isil spreading their jihad across the known univerese like how isil and other extremist group are doing it right now but hey im all for it in a new remake of dune
movies,not_removed,beetlejuice
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,you done did it now son
movies,not_removed,well there is this thx dinner
movies,not_removed,i thought it was always a worm too until i ended up getting a star wars book about all the wildlife and stuff
movies,not_removed,its gonna take a lot to drag me awayyyy from youuuuu
movies,not_removed,a couple of dramatic and bizarre changes
movies,not_removed,theres a star wars version in comicbook form called blue harvest its really good
movies,not_removed,— hollywood
movies,not_removed,its
movies,not_removed,empire
movies,not_removed,lollllll the other toto song i bless the rains down in arrakis
movies,not_removed,well sure and i guess the scope of a couple can differ i mean its clearly dune theres sandworms and guild navigators i just thought the miniseries kept much closer to the books is all i meant
movies,not_removed,fucking danny elfman
movies,not_removed,yeah i know edit although you may not have been talking to me lol but seriously a criminally underrated soundtrack also how i first heard of brian eno
movies,not_removed,i believe you mean by johnny cash performed by halsey
movies,not_removed,halsey has a wonderful voice
movies,not_removed,oh shit my bad didnt know
movies,not_removed,i like the cover but make sure to give the original a listen too
movies,not_removed,youre good no intention to sound stuck up i just know a lot of people that didnt know the original
movies,not_removed,no its okayhonestly i know he did the original song i just completely forgot with this cover i honestly just didnt realize this was a cover lol but thanks i wouldve realized if you hadnt commented
movies,not_removed,except for the to me cringe inducing diy dentistry scene the whole movie is epic
movies,not_removed,its how i feel every time i make jello
movies,not_removed,how producers feel when they make a new beat﻿
movies,not_removed,i need a person that looks at me like ben affleck looks at matt damon
movies,not_removed,ben afflecks first reaction is to see if matt damon is alright
movies,not_removed,the rock looks like one of those giant heads that makes earth compete in that reality music show in rick and morty
movies,not_removed,affleck aint even worked up with that shit hes looking at the love of his life matt damon
movies,not_removed,mel gibsons date is fucking hot looks like brittany snow from the vicious kind
movies,not_removed,when they say they announced the wrong best picture winner but you just saw the signal out the window gotta think of an excuse to leave
movies,not_removed,streep looks like shes seeing a poltergeist
movies,not_removed,imagine standing on that stage and all the famous people in the world are just sitting their as spectators
movies,not_removed,the whitehaired old dude behind gibson has my reaction
movies,not_removed,matt damon looks like me when i found out where babies came from
movies,not_removed,noooo mel gibsons beard it was magical
movies,not_removed,to me hes like dude i thought your beef with jimmy was a joke this your fault youve taken this shit too far
movies,not_removed,tfw you realize hes looking at mels hot date
movies,not_removed,greatest bromance of the century
movies,not_removed,that was my first thought
movies,not_removed,someones need to photoshop in the peoples eyebrow
movies,not_removed,if the oscars are going to cook up some controversy the rock will smell it
movies,not_removed,he looks like someone poorly photoshopped his head into the picture
movies,not_removed,im pretty high rn but i definitely have to agree
movies,not_removed,shes actually mels wife rosalind ross rmelgibson
movies,not_removed,years old lol
movies,not_removed,when it comes to discovering new silent films i always go to wwwsilenteracom but to watch online ive always utilized youtube and google video search with great luck start with this search link httpswwwgooglecomqsilentfilmtbsdurltbmvid sorry if you already do this if not i hope it helps
movies,not_removed,if you havent seen it yet i highly recommend the silent german expressionist classic the cabinet of dr caligari while not a monster movie its an early example of a psychological thriller and is one of the first films in history to introduce a mindblowing plot twist
movies,not_removed,i search you tube but id never heard of silent eracom thanks
movies,not_removed,ill be watching it tonight with my wife as part of our silent new years eve party looking forward to it thanks for the recommendation
movies,not_removed,my pleasure so what did you think
movies,not_removed,loved it the visual style was fantastic and the sound was great and the ending wasnt what i expected at all in fact for a moment i actually thought id missed something when it turned out well i dont want to ruin it for anyone
movies,not_removed,thanks for sharing your review
movies,not_removed,i apprecaite the links and the suggestions my wife and i are making silent movie sundays a regular thing now
movies,not_removed,rewatched police story and recently i like supercop the best and thought new police story was pretty good thought the serious tone was interesting still need to see lockdown
movies,not_removed,that cosplay looks pretty freaky
movies,not_removed,you know i was just thinking to myself gee id really like to sexualize some anthropomorphized animals from a kids movie but it just feels to damn creepy but now they look human so i can masturbate guiltfree thanks op
movies,not_removed,the art style of is quite adorable not sure about the rest
movies,not_removed,im glad that nick look like bigby wolf in the first one
movies,not_removed,they all the same fuckin face
movies,not_removed,furry me
movies,not_removed,i dont really like zootopia but that url is on point
movies,not_removed,of courseall white people with one black guy why am i not surprised
movies,not_removed,the internet the answer to all our needs
movies,not_removed,since the movie was basically about racism it would have been better to have nick represented as a black dude but i understand making the chief black since he is idris elba
movies,not_removed,i have lofty hopes and low expectations gonna bring a big ass bucket of popcorn snag a pepsi slushy and mindlessly munch away with my mouth open staring wideeyed in glee as monsters beat the shit out of each other
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,well not for nothing but the ending to rogue one has been written since
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i hope theyre not trying to soften the movie i read somewhere the creative minds wanted it to be a tough war movie rather than another space opera installment and that got me way pumped
movies,not_removed,but rogue one has fallen short of what jj abrams did with star wars episode vii — the force awakens so disney has ordered reshoots of course there are always reshoots for large movies but this seems like a quality issue one that i believe will be corrected there is far too much riding on these movies and disney has the power to do so
movies,not_removed,how is it supposed to feature a cameo from young han solo it is supposed to take place essentially immediately before a new hope so shouldnt it just be a han solo cameo
movies,not_removed,i rebel
movies,not_removed,not exactly news every movie this size gets reshoots its usually as much a product of needing to work around peoples schedules as much as anything else
movies,not_removed,i hope they are not trying to connect it too much to the original films i think the more stand alone the movie is the better i dont want felicity jones character to be related to anyone or anything
movies,not_removed,all movies of this size schedule reshoots as late as possible everyone likes to read into these news bits that the studio is trying to change things or are unsure about the current state of the film but this is the status quo every tentpole film does this for effects reasons actor scheduling pickup shoots and even adding scenes for better narrative cohesion after seeing how a rough edit of the movie flows heck pretty much every disneymarvel movie does this so that they can also keep more secretive scenes under the radar postcredits scenes cameos etc nothing to see here folks move along
movies,not_removed,everyone is acting like this is normal but did anyone notice this isnt the directors opinions this is the disney execs asking for resorts i hope the final product is good but i also hope disney is letting the team do what they need and not trying to tamper with the current lucasfilm creative process
movies,not_removed,must be to add humor
movies,not_removed,wow where where all you reshoots are totally normal when faraci was taking a dump on suicide squad
movies,not_removed,i was guessing that every one of the main characters dies in the end seeing as how theyre not in the ot i wonder if disney decided they wouldnt sell any toys if that happened and decided to have them go into hiding instead
movies,not_removed,whaatt willlllll you do
movies,not_removed,they are adding the rock
movies,not_removed,the premise of disney execs ordering changes to a movie goes against the idea that kathleen kennedy is in charge of lucasfilm like kevin feige is in charge of marvel or john lasseter is in charge of pixar is there any evidence that disney has creatively interfered with lucasfilm in a way that changes a film to something different than if george lucas had sold lucasfilm to kathleen kennedy im going to get downvoted because im going against what the headline says
movies,not_removed,i hate to say it but after seeing the quality disney has been able to bring out in movies time and again with only a few bad calls i trust them to step in more than any other studio out there
movies,not_removed,oh my gosh reshoots its going to suck and theyre just changing it because they wanna be like this other movie s funny how when rogue one goes for reshoots no one bats an eye rather its the old well of course this is normal for big budget films like this suicide squad on the other hand and i know disney has a stronger track record with their franchises than warner bros does with dc but it still does humor me how many people rejected the idea that reshoots could be a planned part of the production
movies,not_removed,not surprising this happens with a lot of movies
movies,not_removed,i just hope they get rid of the clichés like weve seen in the trailer like cassian andor smirking when hearing jyn ersos rap sheet or when the commander says is that clear followed by a snotty yes sir from jyn the only way that could have been more cliché is if she said crystal followed by i was born ready god i hope they dont fuck this up like lucas did
movies,not_removed,to me episode felt so safe relied heavy on cameos and took very little creative risk it was built for wide commercial success im still really excited for this one they took a gamble with the script the director and on most actors will it be as successful as ep nah but it could be a better film
movies,not_removed,i mean its probably similar to suicide squad where everyone jumped on the bandwagon saying reshoots the film being poor or whatever people just jumping to conclusions that may well be the case but we dont know and there is no point trying to come to full conclusions without the info
movies,not_removed,my guess is disney is going to do all they can to relate this movie to the main star wars films the current cut probably falls far enough outside the existing lore to confuse a typical casual fan
movies,not_removed,its so they can add more quips and humor into the movie because its too much of a war movie even though the central concept of the movie is a war they decided that a war movie needs more jokes and that it needs to be more cookie cutter
movies,not_removed,hope its not too hunger gamesey i got a hell of a katniss vibe off that chick and god damn i cant stand it i think im the only one in my group of friends not excited about it and the only one who cringed so hard they almost had a stroke during the line i rebel
movies,not_removed,disney execs but how does this tie into the current films will this movie alienate anybody is darth vader in this can we put more darth vader in this we need more darth vader and more death star
movies,not_removed,i hate the term not testing well suggests risk taking which in loads of cases is a good thing
movies,not_removed,this is nonsense sensationalism every movie no matter how good always does reshoots its part of the business for crying out loud
movies,not_removed,rogue one gets reshoots and nobody bats an eye suicide squad gets reshoots and everyone loses their minds
movies,not_removed,reshoots arent a big deal its probably just some pickup shots nothing major
movies,not_removed,in other news i took a shit in a piece of tin foil wrapped it up and wrote star wars on it im currently taking bids in excess of seven figures on ebay
movies,not_removed,like every movie ever
movies,not_removed,probably to add more humor
movies,not_removed,movies undergo reshoots all the time in fact its so common that itd be news if a big movie didnt have reshoots how to turn that into clickbait well insert a narrative rogue one ooohh ordered to undergo reshoots uh oh whats that sounds bad this summer by disney execs boo evil bingo
movies,not_removed,i have a bad feeling about this
movies,not_removed,i wonder if falling short is not being a copy of something else i was waiting for this with expectation after not enjoying episode that much now i must say i have a bad feeling about this
movies,not_removed,hard to polish a turd im predicting a top possible score of well at least they are taking it seriously and spending some dough i hope disney views the star wars license similar to their marquee animated films its has to be good or they wont put it out
movies,not_removed,they want a giant spider in the act
movies,not_removed,force awakens set a high bar wait what what mad universe are we in
movies,not_removed,say hello to jarjars return
movies,not_removed,not testing well there is no way a movie like this would have test screenings this early article is bogus
movies,not_removed,why is this news every single film that can afford to does this once editing starts the director and editor get into the cutting room and realize oh shit i need this scene shot from that angle or the pacing on this shot sucks maybe it just wasnt working and they didnt want the public to see that shit could it possibly be they dont want to be labeled the new prequel nah must be some nefarious censorship thing
movies,not_removed,he probably just didnt show vader enough d
movies,not_removed,not enough jarjar i guess
movies,not_removed,its in crisis seriously what the fuck is wrong with this guy every movie undergos reshoots or is rejiggered hell while serenity was being tested they made a cut of the film where the operative never speaks or final destination the entire paris ending was shot when the audiences didnt understand the ghost boyfriend nonsense original ending i could go on stop worrying it will be fine
movies,not_removed,an assumedly professional writer used the phrase cruel rule in this article shit i said gritty city again
movies,not_removed,first suicide squad now this when did it become headlines that studios demand reshoots this happens with almost every movie
movies,not_removed,part time
movies,not_removed,if it is a quality issue then i love disney for their decision it just means they care enough to make sure the movie is good rather than saying fuck it theyll pay for it anyway
movies,not_removed,this is not news every movies has reshoots its built into the production timeline now if they start pushing the release date back by months then theres a problem
movies,not_removed,so post production as usual these posts the last few days trying to piss people off with reshoots and editing stories are starting to piss me off this is regular with any movie
movies,not_removed,that garbage pixelated image halfway through the article would have been best left out or maybe just shrunk so you dont notice the pixelation do these sites have editors
movies,not_removed,reshoots are common in large scale media i recall mad max fury road took a longass time with scouting in shooting starting up i believe rogue one has a disney tag to the movie which i hope the execs push a watered down dark theme i am expecting a esblike movie that is my favorite of the seven
movies,not_removed,prequels are always tricky to get right as george lucass noughties films would tend to demonstrate there is a good argument for unnumbered star wars films but perhaps they would work better in the resistancefirst order era where there is more room to manoeuvre in terms of plot and twists
movies,not_removed,oh but they couldnt fucking do age of ultron reshoots
movies,not_removed,not enough references to its multiverse
movies,not_removed,they asked him about the editing and why he still needed to change some things with the movie releasing this year he simply looked up defiantly and said i reshoot they instantly knew he was the man for the job
movies,not_removed,oh great it always turns out well if the money guys make the creative decisions sigh
movies,not_removed,turns out it was too original theyre going to mangle the shit out of it until it looks exactly like the last one
movies,not_removed,he cut away from the action too much again didnt he edit sarcasm
movies,not_removed,reshoots rabble rabble rabble
movies,not_removed,guys we made the movie for much less money than we cooked the books with we need to reshoot so we can write off more jerry gold plate all of the lightsabers sarah please go replace the ice cubes in peoples drinks with diamonds
movies,not_removed,good or bad itll be painted like star wars so all will pretend to love it
movies,not_removed,id bet almost anything they remove that i rebel line
movies,not_removed,if they tone down the violencefuck disney
movies,not_removed,reddits favorite circlejerk mad max went through reshoots also this shouldnt be seen as a bad thing
movies,not_removed,if the disney execs are asking for reshoot the movie probably went too far towards gritty war drama especially if the rumours of vaders brutality are to be believed like or not star wars is a fantasy space opera and theres only so far you can go before something just feels wrong make a sw movie too violent bloody and its just incongruent to that universe see vaders implied slaughter of the children in ep iii for many even that went too far
movies,not_removed,the execs at disney are not happy with the movie and rogue one will have to go back into four weeks of expensive reshoots in july ok gareths work on the first godzilla shows he can handle a big studio blockbuster but rogue one has fallen short of what jj abrams did with star wars episode vii the force awakens so disney has ordered reshoots the only thing about godzilla that wasnt a failure was that people went and watched it that was the most disappointing movie of the year the first twenty minutes were great everything else was a massive incoherent waste of time disney wont take a back seat and is demanding changes as the movie isnt testing well seems to counterdict this reddit attitude that nothing is wrong and reshoots are common also tfa was a blatant rip off in every thematic way of a new hope except that rey is trained by literally no one and is basically unstoppable in every single regard she is the worst mary sue i can think of on film
movies,not_removed,guess that means it sucks balls right or does disney get a free pass
movies,not_removed,time to panic they are doing reshoots movie is doomed s
movies,not_removed,its too original cant you crib some stuff from the original trilogy can one of the characters say ive got a bad feeling about this
movies,not_removed,why the hell would han solo be in this movie he had nothing to do with the rebel alliance until luke and leia came along stupid
movies,not_removed,i didnt really like monsters or godzilla that this director took part in godzilla was especially bad in my mind i dunno its just that his movies seemed forgettable maybe i have to recalibrate my taste for movies as ep was not as enjoyable for me as it was for a lot of moviegoers and diehard sw fans in fact im starting to white knight the prequels
movies,not_removed,rogue one has fallen short of what jj abrams did with star wars episode vii — the force awakens wow it must be utter crap right now
movies,not_removed,fallen short of what jj did with the force awakens all jj did was pretty up a redo of iv
movies,not_removed,just scrap rogue one you only invested mil in marketing it so far just push up episode viiis date and all will be forgiven
movies,not_removed,needs more feminists quick get anita to star in it also add more lines to insult any male actor that wants to help her let go of my hand
movies,not_removed,this seems more like click bait bullshit tons of big movies do reshoots
movies,not_removed,but rogue one has fallen short of what jj abrams did with star wars episode vii but that movie wasnt really that good either
movies,not_removed,i have a bad feeling about this i was really looking forward to this movie
movies,not_removed,it begins
movies,not_removed,kids can take some pretty heavy shit these days if they are going to make it into a badass war movie like it should be the kids wont mind and the majority of viewers will be late teens to middle aged fans of the franchise either way the reshoots wont be because it was too dark
movies,not_removed,more vader probably
movies,not_removed,just about every movie does reshoots im not worried yet
movies,not_removed,to add more jokes i hope
movies,not_removed,disney seems to have excellent quality control for the most part looking at the metacritic scores of all the major studios last year disney had the highest so im pretty optimistic that rogue one will be at least a solid film
movies,not_removed,i hate being this guy but with all the movies they are planning some of them are going to be clunkers it will still make a billion dollars no matter what they put out
movies,not_removed,please no love triangle please no love triangle please no love triangle
movies,not_removed,i wish people would stop posting these reshoots are a totally normal part of the studio filmmaking process indie movies would do it too if they had the budget and time reshoots are scheduled months in advance often before principal photography even begins it doesnt say anything about the presumed quality of the film
movies,not_removed,i would guess that this has to do with including han solo since they just cast him
movies,not_removed,based on the past few years worth of disney movies if the movie needs reshoots then the disney execs probably know what theyre doing
movies,not_removed,four weeks is an entire movies shooting schedule
movies,not_removed,i was worried until i got to the bottom where they decided to wait to tell us that this was anticipated and not just a reaction to a terrible movie
movies,not_removed,come on disney can we please have one gritty star wars
movies,not_removed,execs when you need a movie to actually be good call the execs
movies,not_removed,these news all come from an unconfirmed rumour
movies,not_removed,that doesnt sound good weeks is huge theyre either making it more kidfriendly or its just shit either waywe lose
movies,not_removed,hopefully to increase donny yens screentime
movies,not_removed,ive got a bad feeling about this
movies,not_removed,a lot movies do this and its not as big as people here think most scenes are in greenroom anyway
movies,not_removed,definitely adding more fart jokes
movies,not_removed,its ok theyre probably just adding more comedy
movies,not_removed,damnit i hate sites that have multiple auto starting videos
movies,not_removed,force awakens was doing reshoots up through august last year months before it came out i heard they were literally running footage to editing as soon as the cards came out of cameras
movies,not_removed,every movie does reshoots how many times is this going to be news
movies,not_removed,ordered to undergo has results scheduled
movies,not_removed,is four weeks of reshoots troubling or is it just par of the course a months worth of reshoots isnt a good sign right
movies,not_removed,the next time disney say theyre going for a different type of film how about they go and let them make a different type of film
movies,not_removed,well this is a bummer
movies,not_removed,will there be any characters featured here from the main sw movies
movies,not_removed,kyle katarn lives
movies,not_removed,the force is not strong with this one oh no
movies,not_removed,they have to work in the beyonce video introducing the new iphone
movies,not_removed,this is a good thing people
movies,not_removed,hehhehehehehahahahahahahahahahahahaha
movies,not_removed,probably needs more lesbian pixar fish
movies,not_removed,im starting to grow really tired of the media making such a big deal when a blockbuster enters reshoots this is the norm now they put aside extra time to do these things in case every time this news comes out these websites label the production as in trouble this could sometimes be the case but please stop every big movie goes through reshoots it does not mean its because the movie is in rough shape
movies,not_removed,i feel like the title is somewhat misleading lots of movies especially ones that are expected to do well go through reshoots all the time
movies,not_removed,i really dont want this film to be trash i go to the same school that gareth went to and were really proud of his journey
movies,not_removed,i wish they had felt that obligated to make quality games as well battlefront was a total train wreck
movies,not_removed,my only grip with the new star wars is the lack of aliens in the main cast one fun aspect of the series was seeing non human force users
movies,not_removed,this will be good if its bad theyll do the han solo movie and abandon the idea of future anthology stories
movies,not_removed,i hope the fanboys dont issue death threats against the director a la no mans sky
movies,not_removed,did the jackson estate clear probate maybe they are integrating captain eo into the plot
movies,not_removed,httpimgurcomqalovnh
movies,not_removed,i never felt he wasnt the greatest choice to direct this godzilla was hohum he cut away from the godzilla action right before the mayhemtwice you dont see any zilla action until the halfway point of the movie
movies,not_removed,reshoots are never a good thing has there ever been a good movie that had serious reshoots edit im dumb
movies,not_removed,and thus the reddit hivemind begins to shift
movies,not_removed,uh oh
movies,not_removed,so normal movie buisness is afoot shocking
movies,not_removed,reshoots are fairly commonplace in hollywood especially in big blockbusters like this dont lose your goddamn minds yet
movies,not_removed,no cause for concern nothing surprising here of todays films do reshoots inserts and unit work after principle photography wraps industryexperience
movies,not_removed,monsters was just ok a great first film especially considering the budget but overall its not a great movie godzilla was just ok the evil disney overlords might have a right to be concerned
movies,not_removed,ive got a bad feeling about this
movies,not_removed,can anyone tell me an example of a reshoot what it is and why they need to do it i have no idea what a reshoot refers to
movies,not_removed,may be true may be false but the fact remains the source cited is shit
movies,not_removed,not enough jokes
movies,not_removed,theyre going for that new r rating trend s
movies,not_removed,no surprise not a big fan of the godzilla movie hopefully disney fixes what needs to be fixed
movies,not_removed,uh oh
movies,not_removed,why would disney execs with lots of stock in the company leak information that is damaging to their own bottom line this is probably clickbait
movies,not_removed,theyre most likely doing pickups like every movie does
movies,not_removed,remember being disney is a double edged sword
movies,not_removed,my favourite thing from everything weve seenheard about rogue one is the part after in this teaser trailer
movies,not_removed,that dark vibe was the reason i was so excited for this release really hoping disneys interference wont change that
movies,not_removed,this link is something i found that relates to this now if were basing the approach of this movie to other star wars movies we will get teases in three month increments that give absolutely no information but show the visual grandeur of the franchise thats if the studio trusts and believes in the movie if you notice movies that were high risk or tested poorly or have no real backing by the studio follow these three rules very little to no information till the last six months before the movie then everything is spilled when i say everything i mean everything the main plot is literally shown and all major villain and character reveals are shown why because this is gonna tank and they want to grab as many people as they can for as long as they can before something else shiny and new arrives lack of exposure now i get that a spinoff isnt getting the same market push as the main franchise but if there is literally nothing but s few toys and a coloring book to tie in no interviews with the director months and months before no interviews with actors or questions allowed to be askedreleased before the movie and theres little to no market saturation taco bell atat toys random new character is prominent on a cereal or mountain dew or doritos this is usually a huge indicator that the studio either doesnt expect much hates the movie or has given up because it tests poorly no matter what they do because it was just a bad deal now you couple a series of reports that say the extensive reshoots like everyone said not uncommon with the sheer tonnage of reports that say the movie tested poorly and you get an uneasy picture i think the movie will likely be pretty good realistically if this movie suffers it will be because edwards loves to make movies about people godzilla was more a survivor movie than disaster or monster same with his first major release monsters its entirely likely this movie suffers by test audiences expecting a abrams flashy fast installation and edwards is subversive and character driven with a focus on the people and circumstances and not the world rending power in the universe of star wars there may also be a problem with the audience not understanding the title rogue one is a call sign they may not understand or appreciate the significance of the title or may be expecting a movie with a ton of star fighter fights and get a heist movie the article is worth publishing and there may be financial risk for disney edited for clarity
movies,not_removed,i agree as i want to see something a bit different in the franchise having said that i think it is still possible the move could go so far as to not fit as a star wars movie im sure disney feels they are walking a fine line
movies,not_removed,its probs more like they are trying to make it more tie in with the new trilogy even though lucas expressly forbade that
movies,not_removed,disney chose a director that has literally one blockbuster on his filmography its entirely believable that the movie could be subpar godzilla is the only nonbbc movie this guy has directed and it was just ok
movies,not_removed,another article clarifies that it has fallen short of the force awakens in addressing the fourquadrants demographic it is not so much a question of quality as of marketability
movies,not_removed,yeah the only reason i am sort of okay with a han solo prequel movie is the idea that it will be several years before a new hope having a different person play him within a year or two of harrison fords age in a new hope just feels weirdly revisionist also there is absolutely no reason for han solo to be involved in this story
movies,not_removed,i hate that line the scene may make sense in the movie but as presented in the trailer its dumb sounds like something from a shitty ya novel
movies,not_removed,yessir
movies,not_removed,the worst part of that scene is the other ladys the one talking to her reaction as if that line is so badass and witty that she changes her opinion and now suddenly realizes that this chick is the right woman for the job the scene looks corny and cringe worthy as fuck
movies,not_removed,i emp
movies,not_removed,this blatant badassery is the only part i dont like i hope shes not some star wars version of a modern misunderstood orphan rebel who has a chip on her shoulder and doesnt do authority otherwise i love the dark war in space theme
movies,not_removed,ugh
movies,not_removed,yes smirks sir
movies,not_removed,starring will smith
movies,not_removed,i volunteer as tribute
movies,not_removed,if i could roll my eyes any farther back into my head id never see them again
movies,not_removed,this movie feels like its going to cut itself on its own edge and risks the possibility of not feeling star wars stick stupid one liners in there and it starts tiptoeing into that young adult genre really hope she doesnt end up being one of those edge lords who has a problem with authority thats been overdone to death
movies,not_removed,yes sir
movies,not_removed,theyve lost confidence theyre adding jokes
movies,not_removed,disney wont take a back seat and is demanding changes as the movie isnt testing well seems like their test audience doesnt like it
movies,not_removed,theyre saying that this isnt the average reshoots that are scheduled though
movies,not_removed,four weeks of reshoots how many scenes is that to reshoot really two or three
movies,not_removed,last september they were still doing some scenes for episode if anything with reshoots or not their schedule is looking better for this film
movies,not_removed,yeah i get the feeling this is a normal practice but folk think that this is an indication the film might be terrible
movies,not_removed,i hope and expect the same all these rumours about han and snoke appearing is just nonsense im expecting the only cameo or connection from the main saga well be seeing is a brief appearance from vader
movies,not_removed,if she is im throwing my hands in the air
movies,not_removed,maybe shes uh the girl jedis mommy that would work
movies,not_removed,honestly ive been thinking about how much this ruins things like ang lees hulk movie really the principle villain is bruce banners father who makes mutant dogs the astronomical suspension of disbelief that banner had a gamma ray accident and became the hulk needs to be multiplied a billion fold by adding the coincidence that his dad also is capable of making hulk dogs great wonderful idea that makes so much fucking sense its not a random unrelated villain no its his dad
movies,not_removed,yeah but it is the disney execs pushing it not the creative team
movies,not_removed,could be a fury road situation where the studio really liked what it sees and gives them more time and money to add to that
movies,not_removed,not enough merchandise potential in the first cut
movies,not_removed,nah its gotta be rated r because deadpool
movies,not_removed,what happened
movies,not_removed,this thought occurred to me as well i guess we shall see if any of the characters get retconned into the new trilogy or if disney finds some way to sequelize any of the surviving characters seeing that this movie does gangbusters which it will toys will do fine either way
movies,not_removed,as a scorpion jedi no doubt
movies,not_removed,dont see the reason for hate to say it think they are doing a great job and obviously value what they create not that its uncommon for reshoots anyway but
movies,not_removed,why do you hate to say it
movies,not_removed,well it is normal i mean the mcu is known for always planning reshoots for one people are just always cynical i mean the suicide squad rumors have been debunked for a long time now and people still believe those
movies,not_removed,ghostbuster went for reshoots the other month after the trailer nobody even mentioned it
movies,not_removed,what really sucks is how clickbait and out of context crap online can seriously dictate the narrative of public perception for a film months before its released then everyone goes into with a negative attitude right off the bat
movies,not_removed,i didnt sign up for this followed by a black man saying oh hell naw
movies,not_removed,i rebel jesus fucking christ
movies,not_removed,what cameos
movies,not_removed,yep shes so fucking ya i nicknamed this movie rebelliant pity because everything else in the trailers looks fucking amazing
movies,not_removed,yep the rest of the movie looks pretty damn good but i cant stand the main character i rebel is up there with i dont like sand for shittiest lines in a star wars movie ever
movies,not_removed,even the stupidest most elementally male horndog part of me would love to see a heroine in a film thats not a hell lets have an unfuckable heroine for like the first time in history and i may actually be able to forget im watching a bigbudget film
movies,not_removed,kennedy one darth vader needs to be louder angrier and have access to a time machine two whenever darth vader is not on screen all the other characters should be asking wheres darth vader three
movies,not_removed,wrong joker meme you needed oh rogue one im not gonna kill you im just gonna reshoot you really really bad
movies,not_removed,people lose their minds about suicide squad because every dc movie since the nolan trilogy has been subpar suicide squad actually being good would be a huge departure from warner brothers last few films thats not to say people shouldnt be worried about rogue one disney chose someone with almost no experience directing big budget movies and they are possibly paying for it godzilla is gareth edwards only other big budget movie and that was pretty meh
movies,not_removed,snoke snoke binks
movies,not_removed,cos it literally says in the title that reshoots are ordered by disney execs not director
movies,not_removed,a lot of people didnt even pretend to love the prequels
movies,not_removed,that line made me think of you just started a war line from the civil war trailers that didnt make it to the movie
movies,not_removed,preferably sw game that has more going for it than just some pretty graphics and a sw theme
movies,not_removed,no every major blockbuster undergoes reshoots
movies,not_removed,theyre milking the hell out of it somethings bound to go wrong
movies,not_removed,because disney and toys
movies,not_removed,after years and failed attempts it was the first time since empire strikes back that we got a nondisappointing star wars movie give the man some credit
movies,not_removed,id take tfa over the prequels anytime so im fine with what jj did
movies,not_removed,how is let go of my hand an insult she didnt want to be taken by him because he was being chased and she thought theyd ignore her also it was more of a quick way to establish that she doesnt want to go with him then decides to when things get bad they end up taking each others hand than it was a feminist thing
movies,not_removed,im trying to think has there been any major hollywood film recently that didnt get reshoots when films had smaller budgets im sure the expense of doing reshoots was significant but nowadays if the film is edited and something is missing itd be throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars to not go back and get that last bit of footage
movies,not_removed,literally every movie ever has reshoots its a normal part of the movie making process you dont turn in a paper before reading it over and fixing a few paragraphs to make it a better paper
movies,not_removed,kids have less ability to take shit now than at any other time in human history
movies,not_removed,leia darth vader palpatine
movies,not_removed,like all of them lol
movies,not_removed,deadpool had reshoots no
movies,not_removed,pretty much all movies have reshoots
movies,not_removed,they already shot a scene a awhile ago and now decide they dont like it as it is so they have to get all the crew and actors and locations again to do it again
movies,not_removed,yeah every movie does this you could have the best script ever shot and acted and directed by the best people only to get into the editing room and find the movie doesnt work and requires additional scenes happens all the time
movies,not_removed,disney exec pray i dont alter it any further
movies,not_removed,yeah why is this big news movies go through reshoots all the time especially huge blockbusters like this with practical effects cg and big set pieces not everything is going to work right during the first shoot
movies,not_removed,well there was one movie that claimed to have shot with the first pass of the script exactly as is from beginning to end without reshoots fucking million dollar baby
movies,not_removed,studio forcing more humor reference to suicide squad rumors that got debunked
movies,not_removed,if those are pickups why does the title say reshoots
movies,not_removed,pickups
movies,not_removed,yeah i am sick of these recent reshoot announcements being skewed as if something is wrong with the movie most big tentpole movies have reshoots
movies,not_removed,are pickups done at the request of studio executives though it seems to me this would be the directorproducers call
movies,not_removed,thank you i love reshoot and pick ups its like of my work for the year and i get bigger name credits haha
movies,not_removed,no it must be to add jokes
movies,not_removed,i remember watching the lotr extras when they were talking about pickups for return of the king i think peter jackson asked andy serkis to come over for dinner and then said that he wanted to shoot some pickups they had him lying down next to some stairs doing lines that i believe made it into the movie
movies,not_removed,what difference if any is there between this and the reshoots going on with suicide squad people have been jumping all over that saying that the studio didnt like it and they have to go back and reshoot scenes to make the movie funnier is there more truth to the suicide squad rumors or are both situations equally misleading
movies,not_removed,correct in fact its usually part of the budgets and schedule of every production
movies,not_removed,came here to say this im not sure why this is even news it would be news if a hollywood movie didnt have to do any reshoots that shit would be impressive this is just what literally every movie does reshoots are standard
movies,not_removed,disney has done dark movies before the pirates trilogy got preeeeeetty dark at points and it still made a shitton of money they just need to have the courage of their convictions its star wars there is no safer property with which to push the envelope a little lucass prequels couldnt stop the hypetrain on unless rogue one is literally a steaming pile of shit for hours i doubt it can put any breaks on it and they know the value of changing up tones of movies within franchises and universes mcu is a great example captain america and the iron man movies had different tones from the avengers and even within their own series they would have to be the dumbest cunts on the planet not to realize the above thats why i dont think its disney going soft though that does make me wonder whats up
movies,not_removed,one edge is a nerf blade the other edge is plastic to be clear even i dont get my analogy
movies,not_removed,really dont agree with this statement disney has handled every company theyve bought with great care and respect marvel lucasfilm and pixar are all excelling right now
movies,not_removed,i dont catch your meaning
movies,not_removed,im still amazed we didnt get this teaser trailer officially it was so good
movies,not_removed,thats no moon
movies,not_removed,i hope thats the scene vader shows up in
movies,not_removed,the death star is way too big in that shot
movies,not_removed,disney hasnt screwed up any of the marvel films after taking over and theyre letting rian johnson direct episode viii i think it will be ok
movies,not_removed,dont forget about monsters
movies,not_removed,i thought it was amazing if anything whats happening could be similar to what happened with godzilla the movie is too weird for mainstream audiences and thats why its not testing well not sure how since the trailer makes it look pretty typical
movies,not_removed,i seriously hope disney pushes the release dates back as far as they need to for all of the upcoming star wars movies dont get me wrong im a huge star wars fan and can hardly wait for rogue one and ep viii but i want them to be the best possible films that they can be companies particularly in the entertainment industries need to focus on quality over quantity now more than ever before
movies,not_removed,ever seen monsters
movies,not_removed,i doubt edwards really had as much of a say in the films production as people are giving him credit over considering how tfa was really a studio film done in jjs style im guessing is a studio film done in edwards style like godzilla technical aspects were probably handled well but other things may have been too inaccessible for mainstream audiences which must be poison to disney
movies,not_removed,all of these directors they hired are puzzling choices even rian johnsons movie which should at least be weird
movies,not_removed,there was no reason for legolas to be involved in the hobbit films either but somebody thought that was a good idea at least in that case they still got the same actor
movies,not_removed,not a phase dad its a lifestyle
movies,not_removed,i think its the tendency to write a strong female character as an emotionless man with boobs
movies,not_removed,it honestly just looks like any other ya movie except its ridiculously well shot
movies,not_removed,i got the sense that they were setting her up as an undercover agent and that the line i rebel was supposed to be tongue in cheek as in theyre asking her to go undercover as an imperial so she has to rebel in order to make it seem legit i mean yeah if shes actually legitimately rebelling and delivering the line that way then its total shit but i dont think thats what they were going for
movies,not_removed,i literally volunteer
movies,not_removed,followed by mon mothmas disappointed teacher look
movies,not_removed,and the sassy yes sir not doing it for me i hope the character is much less hard to watch in the movie
movies,not_removed,its my money and i want it now
movies,not_removed,yeah and thats mon motha leader of the rebellion like she hasnt seen a million more acts of bad assery than this snot nosed noob saying tough shit in the real military when you say shit like that in basic the drill sergeant laughs at you invites other drill sergeants over to hear you repeat it and they laugh at you and then your whole unit does additional exercises for your stupidity while all the drill sergeants laugh at you its just more strong woman virtue signalling
movies,not_removed,i declarebankruptcy
movies,not_removed,i dad
movies,not_removed,modern misunderstood orphan rebel who has a chip on her shoulder and doesnt do authority you mean like luke or anakin or rey
movies,not_removed,like hunger games in space ah shit someone else already got to it
movies,not_removed,like punching a nearly two meter tall armored soldier with her bare fist
movies,not_removed,so thats it we some sort of rebel alliance or something
movies,not_removed,one of those edge lords who has a problem with authority isnt the whole rebel faction technically this also did anyone else feel a mix of emotions seeing mon mothma again i honestly wasnt sure how to react when i saw the trailer in theaters
movies,not_removed,every decently budgeted movie plans for them and theyre called pickups not reshoots
movies,not_removed,thats what they say in the article
movies,not_removed,binks is back
movies,not_removed,something something suicide squad
movies,not_removed,so yeah probably
movies,not_removed,yeah according to their hollywood sourcemovie insider that line just screams of someone trying to drop in a figure of speech that the average person can understand trust me this movie isnt testing with anyone but executives at this stage i think all this is totally fabricated
movies,not_removed,you and i may be the only people in this thread who read the article
movies,not_removed,that doesnt seem so bad still pumped to see it
movies,not_removed,some movies are shot in days or less your idea of how long a scene takes is kinda really off
movies,not_removed,that must be when they did the poe scenes set after his intended death the crash
movies,not_removed,i dont think vaders appearance in the film will be brief probably similar to how spiderman was used in civil war but with a lot more scenes in the second half of the movie and doing so much death and destruction for the rebellion director krennic will probably be failing to get the plans back so the emperor calls in vader to deal with the situation
movies,not_removed,and waving them like you just dont care
movies,not_removed,relate all the things
movies,not_removed,and all the pixar characters are in the same universe and walter white survived and is in the witness protection program and and and
movies,not_removed,exactly the news here isnt there are reshoots the news is the movie isnt good enough and the executives in charge of production want reshoots
movies,not_removed,the executives are the creative team its a massive franchise film you can bet theyve had their hands in everything from the start
movies,not_removed,the article specifically says that the movie isnt testing well and the execs arent happy
movies,not_removed,ss reshoot reaction they are adding jokes same as bvs its a mess reshoot reaction reshoots are normal disney planned this the movie is just fine
movies,not_removed,probably something to do with disney having a monopoly on tentpole blockbusters
movies,not_removed,i think it is because ss reshoot news came out after bad reception on bvs so people speculate meanwhile most mcu movies which also does reshoot never stated why they doing it other than adding some actionstory etc
movies,not_removed,and a violent yet honorable mexican prays to god in a dangerous situation
movies,not_removed,do this raid by the book jyn sir shes a loose cannon storms out of the room
movies,not_removed,have star wars done in the uk where they cast real people a hell of a lot more than hollywood does i mean the empire in the star wars universe is already british
movies,not_removed,if what yousa say about thisa girl is true bring her to mesa
movies,not_removed,yep it helped to build the relationship between rey and finn which i thought they did a very good job with there was also her vision scene that prominently showed her hand being taken by unkar plutt when she didnt want to leave whoever left her in my opinion it had a lot to do with that too but some people just love to bitch about nothing so what do we know
movies,not_removed,you dont turn in a paper before reading it over and fixing a few paragraphs to make it a better paper you underestimate my incompetence
movies,not_removed,this is true
movies,not_removed,nah
movies,not_removed,you ever watch a kids tv show they go pretty raw kids have less patience for bullshit than at any time in history though
movies,not_removed,violence and dark tones are no problem just dont put in racism or sexism and you are good
movies,not_removed,that one robot too
movies,not_removed,interesting thanks
movies,not_removed,and when he says all the time he really means all the time this is so normal that it isnt even worth making a post about it
movies,not_removed,article says its not testing well
movies,not_removed,fuck it have an upvote
movies,not_removed,notably the original star wars was basically made in reshoots fox supposedly thought it was a lost cause when they signed off on them and the lucas turned it into star wars
movies,not_removed,yeah why is this big news probably because of this the source added disney wont take a back seat and is demanding changes as the movie isnt testing well that has me worried id rather see what the director wants not what the disney execs want
movies,not_removed,reasons first is the report that disney is not happy and second is extensive reshoots both are red flags both can be bs or overblown but pick up shots and extensive reshoots are two very different things we will see
movies,not_removed,fucking million dollar baby was that the porn spoof
movies,not_removed,when youre clint eastwood youve been in the business longer than most of the cast and crew have been alive and had a legendary career you tend to be more efficient than the average filmmaker
movies,not_removed,people still believe that shit too so annoying
movies,not_removed,also why ordered by disney execs if it were pickups thats just a part of making the film thats not something thats ordered by executives article seems to suggest that its a case of it simply not being good enough four weeks of reshooting needed to get it up to snuff
movies,not_removed,because newscomau is a site fuelled by sensationalist headlines and clickbait source kind of work for them
movies,not_removed,pickups are when they have to go back and reshoot scenes or film additional scenes to fill in spaces they may have over looked during principal photography
movies,not_removed,they brought the staff back to make them finish the crew basketball tournament
movies,not_removed,i remember that it was for the scene where gollum attacks frodo outside shelobs cave that was a really interesting and one of my favorite parts of the behind the scenes stuff
movies,not_removed,yup i was shocked and happy to hear ive got some children i need to make into corpses
movies,not_removed,ah yes shuffling the functions of the orifices on a face that worked beautifully
movies,not_removed,im not in the film industry but in my experience the trick to working with the money men is not to tell them to fuck off but to work smartly with them so you get what you need and so do they
movies,not_removed,he used his inner stan though not all of us have that
movies,not_removed,rogue one is a perfect experiment they can try something different and if it doesnt work out it is its own movie it wont ruin episode or the solo movie if they go dark and the fans go crazy for it likely then theres a niche within a niche to capitalize on
movies,not_removed,yeah i dont get the disney hate before or after twa came out yes their breadandbutter is entertainment catered to kids but what disney does really well is understanding their customer theyre not stupid enough to think the fanbase for frozen is the same as star wars
movies,not_removed,i kinda do bravo
movies,not_removed,well you have the suits who are protecting a very specific brand that brand has morality police its really hard to get too gritty under the disney name the only way anyone had been able to do so is under the touchstone brand star wars has a very large merchandising brand and there is no way any of it will ever get dark enough to pinch the toy market
movies,not_removed,its like a sword with blades on each side of it
movies,not_removed,holy shit chills
movies,not_removed,my worry is that disney does not want two dark star wars movies released back to back i was hoping ep would be the empire strikes back of this generation with rian in the reigns may not be the case if rogue one ends up being dark and serious
movies,not_removed,maybe it focuses on a really boring character for of the movie while most of the stuff you really want to see is happening offscreen d
movies,not_removed,if he can build the terror of s darth vader like he built the terror of godzillai think im sold on this movie
movies,not_removed,what is amazing about it the most interesting character dies early in the movie and then the protagonist is so generic that i cant remember his name or what he looks i also dont fully understandmaybe i missed itbut why did godzilla attack the two mutos and then just go back into the water
movies,not_removed,the directing was ok but the script was terrible what really made that movie work was the great job from the marketting trailers who made it seem like the movie was about godzilla being the main monster or that bryan cranston was in it also thats what made it so disappointing
movies,not_removed,i thought it was amazing in the cinema but subpar at home
movies,not_removed,those movies would have been just as awful even without legolas
movies,not_removed,and in true elven fashion bloom also does not age
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,the funny thing is that it honest to god feels like a legitimate misunderstanding of what people mean when they say strong female character for some reason way too many people seem to think that this means that they literally must be strong and arent allowed to have personality flaws because that makes them weak
movies,not_removed,not even a man an androgynous placeholder if i can switch a characters gender with zero effect thats probably a bad thing
movies,not_removed,youre probably right or at least im hoping that you are for now though im going to enjoy my irrational hatred of it
movies,not_removed,it seemed like they were in the process of chewing her out for probably going offbook and you know we asked you to sneak in and steal these shipping containers you blew up the facility and wiped out a squad of stormtroopers yeah well fuck you im doing the job i signed up for not the job you gave me
movies,not_removed,i got the sense that she was a double agent sent by the empire to infiltrate the rebels who then turn around and give her a mission to infiltrate the empire like infernal affairs or the departed
movies,not_removed,pokes head out window its my money and i want it now
movies,not_removed,you cant just say bankruptcy and expect anything to happen
movies,not_removed,chip on her shoulder and doesnt do authority pretty much the only one that you listed who fits into that category is anakin the most you can say about luke is that he complains a little and rey isnt even close
movies,not_removed,rey literally spends the whole movie getting advice from her seniors and dreaming about the adults who left her i would say anakin is the only one who fits that bill
movies,not_removed,yes replayed too many times if this is to set a tone for offshoots to the franchise give us new characters they already rebooted a new hope and anything with anakin is bad
movies,not_removed,luke wasnt an orphaned misunderstood rebel from what i remember orphaned i guess but he still had a family anakin was eh rey got a lot of backlash but was still a pretty solid character due to her depth the rogue one girl cant remember her name it seems her only trait is edgy i dont listen to authority kind of stuff hopefully its just the trailer but if thats her whole character thatd be a pretty low point in the series characterwise the other characters in rogue one look intriguing from what ive seen though
movies,not_removed,the difference is they didnt go around announcing it they got sucked into the galactic struggles just because they were trying to do the right thing or what they had to do that i rebel line in the trailer is just trash written by someone that apparently has no concept of character development the only other character i can think of that is that brazen is riddick but thats vin fucking deisel delivering those linesand even then its a little offputting
movies,not_removed,i dont particularly like her acting she was the weakest link in the few other films ive seen her in but hey i doubt we will see her again in a star wars film so theres that
movies,not_removed,its not going to be a good movie if it didnt have the star wars name people wouldnt care much about the trailer
movies,not_removed,time to save the galaxy
movies,not_removed,i felt a pretty big rush seeing tarkin standing in front of that big display screen for sure
movies,not_removed,theyre called resshoots to the media because negativity sells ad space cant wait to see youtube videos pop up on my feed with a star wars logo on fire with reshoots is rogue one bad in the title
movies,not_removed,a pickup is different than a reshoot and the term isnt used that much anyways its too easy to confuse with a negative pickup which is a whole other thing studios will almost never use the term reshoot internally its additional photography its mostly for optics for the investors
movies,not_removed,record scratch yousa miss meesa long time no seesa
movies,not_removed,the new yoda
movies,not_removed,its a page six story from the ny post its probably total garbage the very next line is actually from a disney source explaining how these pick ups were always scheduled
movies,not_removed,seems to be the case everyone is giving it a pass because its star wars i want it to be great but nothing about that first trailer made me think i need to see it felt flat to me
movies,not_removed,you think making a movie is a really slow and inefficient process everyone that works on set would cynically agree with this statement
movies,not_removed,waynes world took days to shoot but waynes world was about two chimps on a davenport in a basement
movies,not_removed,id like to see some examples of that the director of an episode of game of thrones said one minute fight scene took days of shooting
movies,not_removed,it would be really cool if at the very end vader just cuts the protag in half and the movie just fades out on a still shot of him and the credits are silent except for his breathing
movies,not_removed,i think it was jeremy jahns that put it really well that vaders presence in the movie should be short but whenever hes on screen the audience actually fears him the original movies while menacing didnt make him as ferocious as he would have been to have his name plastered across the galaxy i hope they show why in this movie
movies,not_removed,nah its still just a rumour but one that has been given a bizarre amount of credence considering how utterly unlikely and stupid it would be
movies,not_removed,its called poetry george lucas
movies,not_removed,unless we see the whole creative team explode and the director start tweeting horrendous things about production there is absolutely no reason to believe the news in this article is anything worth noticing hell most films arent good at all before adjustments the only reason why we hear about this one is because of the level of scrutiny and anticipation the star wars franchise goes with reshoots either requested by the director or by studio execs are very common and not necessarily bad news
movies,not_removed,no the sensationalistic authors of the article want people to interpret the news that way hence the headline theres nothing out of the ordinary here
movies,not_removed,it specifically says that sources say that sources could be reading into the situation and the media could be blowing the reports out of proportion
movies,not_removed,i felt he was more alluding to the idea of studios stepping in being generally a bad thing he hates to say see spiderman but in this instance its not a terrible thing
movies,not_removed,while im opposed to any kind of monopoly in principle i cant help but feel that disney have deserved their position its not like theyve cheated their way there theyve done it by making consistently good decisions
movies,not_removed,the villain remarks you should have killed me when you had the chance
movies,not_removed,the only remarkable thing about it happening is that the studio has enough money to afford it if people only knew the amount of directors who would love to shoot more while in post but cant
movies,not_removed,they did pick ups for mad max fury road i remember people freaking out turned out to really help the film i am worried its disney trying to soften the film but i trust edwards as a director
movies,not_removed,so why bitch about hte suicide squad reshoots then huh
movies,not_removed,anything for clicks suicide squad reshoots got clicks and now all entertainment sites will do this
movies,not_removed,hmm let the wookie win
movies,not_removed,not just reshootss supposedly in the editing room too his wife re cut the entire movie after horrible internal screenings you may not think it but editors have the power to make or break a movie
movies,not_removed,there was an entire section of the movie which was basically luke hanging around with his friends on tatooine discussing galactic politics httpstarwarswikiacomwikiscenescutfromstarwarsanewhope
movies,not_removed,which could mean that nonfans are confused by where the movie fits and they need to add more context
movies,not_removed,testing well with who is the question it seems to me that disneys priority is merchandising movies are they worried it wont appeal enough to year olds
movies,not_removed,i really hope this means the movie is legitimately good but too dark and therefore wont gross much money and not the movie really sucks
movies,not_removed,id rather see what the disney execs want over a time big budget feature director the folks currently at the helm of the disney machine very rarely make a misstep they know what they are doing
movies,not_removed,agreed this has me much less excited now if its true
movies,not_removed,they need to inset more toy sales into the movie
movies,not_removed,who else orders something that costs or figures director or creative team asks execs hay we need dollars for some more shooting execs say ok execs order reshoots
movies,not_removed,you could have said this with reddit instead of newscomau and i still would have believed you commented faster than i could think
movies,not_removed,can someone please explain this to me before i google ive got children i need to make into corpses and i get asked by someone i live with why thats in search results
movies,not_removed,they hung a child in pirates of the caribbean
movies,not_removed,i heard a common tactic is to over do it so you can then dial it back down to where you actually wanted like if you want a bikini put boobs on the screen and the execs will go thats too much put a bikini on it
movies,not_removed,doug liman basically says fuck off every time lol
movies,not_removed,i mean there are pretty much zero circumstances when telling someone explicitly to fuck off is helpful but still you need to be able to stand your ground my experience with executives is that they will always always push for some sort of compromise which is fine most of the time but sometimes the compromise between a good idea and a bad idea is a bad idea and you need to put your foot down on it because at the end of the day your name is on it and it will be your responsibility
movies,not_removed,are you referring to the recent layoffs or the network changing its content and lacking analysis
movies,not_removed,pirates of the caribbean was by no means high cinema but it is a disney series and it got pretty dark to the point where they hanged a ten year old at the beginning of one movie
movies,not_removed,disney also owned miramax dimension films etc so disney was producing horror films art house films about gay sex etc people say that disney would never let a studio they own make films like these but they do so long as it remains under a different label
movies,not_removed,i do believe they could still make an episode toned movie that doesnt duck out if the fact that this is war and the galaxy is at a low point
movies,not_removed,daredevil is under disney and that gets pretty dark especially with
movies,not_removed,pulp fiction was ultimately a disney film they are more than willing to allow a film to be dark so long as it is not released under the disney logo and i believe lucasfilm is considered its own
movies,not_removed,disney doesnt appear before the movie its a lucasfilm movie
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,theyre multiplying
movies,not_removed,in todays news are our children depressed because of star wars find out at eight when we dive deeper into the darkness that is episode viii and rogue one mah kids hate their lives cause of watching the dark star wars
movies,not_removed,generic army guy tries to get back to his family whats that godzilla fighting muto lets just show you a glimpse of that and then cut to more generic army guy thats what you really want oh yeah you came here maybe to see brian cranston and ken watanabe yeah cranstons character dies in the first act and watanabes character pretty much just makes ominous comments every now and then the real star is you guessed it generic army guy
movies,not_removed,iirc godzilla was just asserting his dominance which is why he took out the mutos
movies,not_removed,that dude looked old as fuck in the hobbit movies
movies,not_removed,luke evans looked more like orlando bloom than orlando bloom did bloom was caked in so much makeup he looked like was carved out of rancid butter
movies,not_removed,seems that way i think katniss everdeen was a good strong female character she was human had emotions weaknesses and she overcame her limitations and she was definitely female you couldnt just gender swap her and have it be the same story writing a strong female action lead can be done but it requires thought effort and talent and its way easier to just write a forgettable mary sue and then accuse anyone who criticizes the resulting snooze fest of misogyny
movies,not_removed,see legend of korra for proper writing of strong female character
movies,not_removed,yes and no
movies,not_removed,why is that a bad thing genuinely curious not challenging the notion id have thought gender should be irrelevant as long as the character is written well unless gender matters within the universecontext like game of thrones for example thats not the case with star wars though
movies,not_removed,lol enjoy away
movies,not_removed,oh dear is a real war not what you thought it would be your court martial will determine if we shoot you now or have you scrub latrines until the empire vaporizes this base because they are coming that explosion led to the capture of some of our agents and now they know our position but im main character never mind then disobeying orders is perfectly fine if youre main character
movies,not_removed,i didnt say it i declared it
movies,not_removed,yeah and luke and rey arent really misunderstood sure uncle owen didnt want luke to go off and join the rebellion but he knew who anakin was and was likely told of the great jedi purge by obi wan so it was really that he was trying to protect luke as if he was his own son there is nothing in episode that shows rey being misunderstood shes just stuck on a junkyard planet with no way of getting off that wouldnt end up with her being sold as a slave dancer for some giant slug guy or whatever sure anakin kinda fits into this description but most people werent happy with how his character was handled in the prequels anyway it would be sexist to give a pass to the new female lead for following this stereotypical character role since so many people have complained about anakins character before any of this was even in development the problem isnt that were persecuting a girl for being independent its that the writers seem to be trying to go with the laziest form of writing if youre going to create a character who is supposed to be a badass you should do your best to show that through their actions and how they interact with other characters dont just write dialogue that goes oh im a badass i rebel and i can do anything even though the big boys at the top dont think i can its weak story telling plain and simple
movies,not_removed,yeah but if you simplify something enough you can compare it to literally anything else and call it the same thing
movies,not_removed,its like poetry
movies,not_removed,i think what got me is that mon mothma was women with englishspeaking roles in the entire original trilogy in the trailer she was on screen with like three one of which was a main character and mon mothma wasnt a superexciting character in a new hope a main character who seems a little but still it was an interesting moment and a weird emotion
movies,not_removed,no sometimes it really is reshoots
movies,not_removed,fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
movies,not_removed,hes a funnier character than weve had before
movies,not_removed,generic actionsci fi movies set in the star wars universe these films will be
movies,not_removed,i agree with you about the trailer they shouldve given us this as the teaser this one is leaked from some shareholders thing or something
movies,not_removed,heh quite probably true but i also think they would vehemently disagree it take a month to shoot two scenes
movies,not_removed,fights and big action set pieces take longer to shoot than dialogue yes but for the most part if youve got a dialogue driven film your indies and what not principal photography is generally about three weeks whiplash was shot in days for example
movies,not_removed,youre talking about an action scene five minutes of fighting in just three days is honestly impressive a dialogue between two characters can involve far fewer shot angles and spend a lot less time prepping between takes
movies,not_removed,hardhome took
movies,not_removed,i want to see badass vader come in at the end and just obliterate everyone establish once and for all hotels ridiculously kickass he is bonus points if the back him up
movies,not_removed,tbh i wouldnt mind a wolverine in dofp style scene where they try to recruit him from some bar and he just tells them to fuck off
movies,not_removed,unless we see the whole creative team explode and the director start tweeting horrendous things about production thats how you get blacklisted
movies,not_removed,you correct in all respect but this news is certainly of interest to people so theres nothing wrong in reporting it
movies,not_removed,the execs at disney are not happy with the movie and rogue one will have to go back into four weeks of expensive reshoots in july
movies,not_removed,it specifically says that sources say that of course its sources you think execs or anyone whose name could be tied to this would come out and say that give me a fucking break
movies,not_removed,its not like theyve cheated their way there theyve done it by making consistently good decisions well the mickey mouse copyright extension act and a lot more lobbying definitely was part of that
movies,not_removed,i imagine there newsworthy part is that they were ordered it sounds like its being done by demand unless when pick ups are done thats considered an order
movies,not_removed,yeah sure but this is the opposite the disney execs want to reshoot not the director
movies,not_removed,on that note can we have george miller do a star wars movie
movies,not_removed,im just worried that this film may not be a one shot i really really hope they let this just be a one shot
movies,not_removed,lets get something straight pickups are individual shots to be added to a scene that has already been shot for continuity or to clarify something shooting entire new scenes is not shooting pickups
movies,not_removed,i respect your opinion but im the opposite i trust disney more than i trust edwards godzilla was meh i hardly see how one mediocre film yes hes done more than one but really hes only known for godzilla merits the keys to a star wars property
movies,not_removed,fury road underwent complete reshoots of scenes due to the unpredictable australian weather and the nature of director george miller being an ocd perfectionist the crew would have known as they were shooting the first time that they would be back to do it again pickups occur when shooting went well but editing the scenes shot becomes too uneven
movies,not_removed,the lotr trilogy also did pickups
movies,not_removed,because the circle jerk doesnt like suicide squad
movies,not_removed,people thought that just because one thing happened after the other suicide squad going into reshoots after bvs being a bit of a disappointment it happened because of the other suicide squad going into reshoots because bvs was bit of a disappointment since pretty much every movie does reshoots this news shouldnt really have blown up the way it did but the timing simply was unfortunate
movies,not_removed,i always wondered how many good movies were ruined by bad editing especially comedys where the timing is everything
movies,not_removed,yep the best example of this is fury road miller is very vocal about the fact his wife basically made the movie with her editing stating had he got someone who previously edited action movies the movie would just look like every other action movie it was the fact she had never edited an action movie before that made it special thankfully she got an oscar for his foresight because hands down her editing was amazing
movies,not_removed,such as batman v superman what a clusterfuck of an editing job
movies,not_removed,as i recall they went from a slower paced drama think david lean coppola style to a faster paced edit with lots of rapid cuts to hieghten the action and move past space mumbojumbo quickly by the american public was tired of brooding paranoid thrillers dramas and reflections on the us decline in the world at that time vietnam war oil crisis recession a future youth oriented action film with positive themes and the good guys win perfectly timed
movies,not_removed,his wife re cut the entire movie after horrible internal screenings richard chew and paul hirsch were coeditors in the room with her and all three worked obsessively on the project doing constant recuts the whole way sometimes fighting george lucas on choices chew was actually interviewed pointing out that george lucas didnt even have a coherent story when they started
movies,not_removed,im really dying to see what the original edits on starwars were like from the descriptions they likened it to an old fashioned style of editing where the scenes were gradually played out and there was a slower pace to them the edit style that eventually took over the film was considered faster paced at the time which doesnt seem so nowadays
movies,not_removed,think about how bad star wars would have been with just some guy on a synth instead of john williams
movies,not_removed,thats almost certainly my guess they probably went out of their way not to have too many easter eggs and tie ins to the main series of films and it confused most audiences shit like wheres the jedi wheres rey they probably want to tie it in better to the main universe id actually prefer that because the alternate is the movie just isnt any good
movies,not_removed,im really struggling to understand how fucking hard it is for some people to work out when this is film is set
movies,not_removed,sometimes the difference between an awful movie and an amazing one mostly comes down to editing with some reshoots and a good editor theres no telling what theyll come up with
movies,not_removed,needs moar lightsabers
movies,not_removed,its a line said by a character on the childrens show
movies,not_removed,gravity falls on disney xd only lasted seasons for a reason that reason being too good for disney xd
movies,not_removed,bill cipher the psychotic villain of alex hirschs amazing animated show gravity falls on disney said this about the child protagonists gravity falls is known to be surprisingly adult and grotesque at times one time
movies,not_removed,right but the villain in question tends to be much more brutal and evil than hanging
movies,not_removed,they used to do that on the gong show every week theyd include a really over the top bit the network censors would shoot it down and feel like they were doing their jobs and then the producers were able to include the borderline risky acts that they actually wanted to show because they looked tamer by comparison then one day one of those over the top acts slipped through and was
movies,not_removed,for team america world police they shot the very graphic and crazy puppet sex scene knowing it would get censored down but that they would only have to get rid of the really bad stuff shitting on their chest etc and what they actually wanted would get left in it worked and you can see the full sex scene in the unrated cut
movies,not_removed,in game development this is called a duck reportedly the animator responsible for creating the queen in battlechess a chess game where the pieces are animated characters that do battle when a capture is made drew a duck accompanying her in every frame of animation so when it came time for signoff by the boss hed say it looks great just get rid of the damn duck
movies,not_removed,olly was that you
movies,not_removed,pirates of the caribbean curse of the black pearl is probably my alltime favorite liveaction disney movie
movies,not_removed,and all movies got the rating so yeah rogue one could go that route
movies,not_removed,to the point where they hanged a ten year old at the beginning of one movie i dont even remember that happening some stuff happening in passing isnt going to destroy a brand now a small plot point building up to several kids all being hung in front of a buildup audience and then the camera panning over all of them twitching and crying i can see disney execs freaking out about
movies,not_removed,as long as kids can look up to the characters and buy toys
movies,not_removed,can you believe this guy was captain america at one point shield really dropped the ball on that one edit proof in the pudding he didnt accept in the main storyline but shield asked frank castle first when looking for a new captain america
movies,not_removed,does the disney logo appear at the beginning of ep i cant remember
movies,not_removed,darth squander
movies,not_removed,i cant stop looking at the second side of the lightsaber as it lights up the mechanical part gets longer in his hand
movies,not_removed,yeah i dont understand people who think its amazing thats the main point
movies,not_removed,yeah ill have to admit it took me a while to actually believe that it was bloom playing the character and not some cgi creation he didnt look real
movies,not_removed,hence the probably
movies,not_removed,sure but it doesnt really do full justice right its like the whole melting pot vs multiculturalism issue some people think equality is the endall goal whereas some people think its important to maintain unique features and aspects of various cultures and the like if genders essentially irrelevant you lose some underlying aspects of character look at furiosa from fury road sure she could have been a dude but her being feminine adds so much depth to the character when she comforts max after his nightmare in the war rig charlize reads her line its okay go back to sleep get some rest in an almost motherly manner with a worse actress or director or if gender is irrelevant we might end up with a generically gruff reading of the line i adore how charlize reads that line and i think its lowkey one of the best creative decisions ive seen in film in years personally as a guy but someone with a mother and sister and whos studied feminism in both political and literary contexts i think the strongest female characters are strong characters who are still outright feminine ripley in alien wants to protect that little girl sarah connor in terminator wants to protect her son and leia spends much of the trilogy teasing luke and han yet theyre all incredible badasses and wonderful characters
movies,not_removed,it isnt always but it often is gender is relevant to people and a good character assuming they are meant to be basically human should seem like a person gender affects how we interact with the world and one another so it should affect the way a character does if it doesnt if the character doesnt have any significant gender qualities then there a few possibilities we dont spend enough time or are in the right situations to see gender differences this is often fine the gender of a clerk doesnt usually matter much to us and it probably doesnt matter in a story not always though if you walk into a victorias secret and the perky young thing coming over to assist you is a man youd probably notice and expect the character of a story to notice as well this reason doesnt work with main characters particularly protagonists because we spend enough time with them that wed expect to notice differences the character really doesnt have any readily identifiable gender traits this is perfectly valid if that was the point some people you really could swap their gender and nothing noticeable would change about them or the way the world treats them and it is a noticeable characteristic of that person often however this is actually reason the character isnt finished you wrote yourself a character slapped a vagina or penis on it and called it a day the character probably has a gender because people write characters as people and so include gender traits even if they dont realize it but no thought has been given as to whether their actions make sense see situation if this is an important character stop and think evaluate the character and their actions do they work as written if yes carry on youre a crappy writer your characters are so unlifelike that it does not matter what gender age or species we give them nothing would change your teenage elf orphan reads exactly like your grandfather dwarf mentor if youre wondering if this makes sense do the same with a characters age race religion or sexuality could you change a characters age without it mattering would yearold rebel have the same dialog as someone who in their fifties decides to join the rebellion does your homosexual character do anything homosexual or have you written a heterosexual and just said theyre gay could you have world in which gender doesnt matter sure youll need to do some damn good worldbuilding to make me buy it though because i havent seen a world like that
movies,not_removed,still thatsthats not anything
movies,not_removed,snips credit card
movies,not_removed,channing tatum and me humans two arms two legs the babes should start coming after me any second now
movies,not_removed,it rhymes
movies,not_removed,hes so dense he rhymes
movies,not_removed,that was much cooler tone seems much better from that teaser as well donnie yen beating guys with a stick in full body armor seemed really lame to me
movies,not_removed,yeah im hoping vader is called in but shows up just too late to actually get the plans back like hes an unstoppable force but just doesnt have the time to reach the plans before they escape
movies,not_removed,you mean first class he was pretty central to kicking off the timeline shift in dofp
movies,not_removed,cough cough josh trank cough cough
movies,not_removed,in appearance maybe but news like these can affect how people perceive the development of any film and shift the discussion around the marketing from hey this film looks interesting cant wait to this looks good but i wonder if x was added by y because of issues in the development maybe they should have done z that might look inoffensive but it takes very little to screw up a marketing campaign and news like these clickbaity in essence potentially spreading like gossip can build up to rumors like yeah this movie has issues probably not going to be good which is bad for the film independently of its qualities
movies,not_removed,one hollywood source told page six thats not exactly concrete evidence
movies,not_removed,weve gotten so cynical that we assume anonymous sources automatically means blatant lies or baseless speculation
movies,not_removed,i think its just written that way to sound ominous
movies,not_removed,theyd better redouble their efforts for their sake
movies,not_removed,it would be set on a desert world and involve our heros racing around on homebuilt improvised vehicles and post apocalyptic weirdos chasing and trying to make them crash so basically episode pod race
movies,not_removed,me too no sequels and i hope the lead dies in the end saving her crew from vader i dont want a happy ending the only goal is to get the plans to the rebels a lot of people need to die and that includes the lead
movies,not_removed,i dont quite understand this the movie has the most fun trailers of the year hands down
movies,not_removed,likewise you wonder how many movies directors ruin that editors fix
movies,not_removed,the timing is always everything in editing one scene out of place for just a mere couple of seconds can throw off the pacing of an entire scene and ruin it
movies,not_removed,i heard an interview with frank stallone once talking about his brother he essentially said that the vast majority of stallones flops were due to bad editing rather than a bad screenplay or director and the vast majority of his critical successes were because of great editing
movies,not_removed,ive heard people say that eyes wide shut suffers from not having been edited by stanley kubrick which might explain why its probably his weakest film
movies,not_removed,lucas miller sounds like we needmore directors getting their wives to edit their movies
movies,not_removed,sorry for late response but i did not know that thats really cool
movies,not_removed,the most expensive movie of all fucking time million budget and scenes were literally out of order how man how edit added dollar amount for people who know things
movies,not_removed,or you literally have to watch every movie and read every book to understand it
movies,not_removed,it feels like at this point if youre deciding youre going in to watch rogue one that youd have some sort of knowledge of star wars eighth film aware its a spin off to the main story down the line itd be an odd place for people to start also its fucking star wars its not some cult film or lesser known indy that has a small audience base who are the only ones wholl understand its the death star its iconic this film is about how the death star is made should be enough for a non star wars fan to understand or we could even assume maybe theyll look into it themselves im aware the latter is probably giving way too much credit to the general public
movies,not_removed,because theres been a ton of hype about new star wars sequels now in between two of the sequel movies theyre releasing an interstitial movie set before the first movie filmed or movie chronologically chronologically its episode clone wars rogue one but in order of theatrical release its clone wars rogue one and there will be two other interstitial films thrown in as well
movies,not_removed,im still waiting for disney to make an animated version of gravitys rainbow
movies,not_removed,i was under the impression that hirsch ended it since the show was only meant to last on that summer
movies,not_removed,lol thats not even a good example shit like that happens in spongebob ffs but yeah its a good show
movies,not_removed,you know when i saw the phrase ive got children i need to make into corpses nathan fillion was the first thing to pop into my mind find that little kid taking a dirt nap with baby jesus its fitting hes actually in the show
movies,not_removed,i see matthew mcconaughey was in the audience
movies,not_removed,im trying to figure out the nickle reference
movies,not_removed,my favourite is when the execs saw the first cut with the opening of the really really shitty marionette in front of crappy background because its a puppeteers busking act one of them leapt to their feet and screamed oh my god they fucked us
movies,not_removed,and what a glorious scene it is
movies,not_removed,espn has been hemorrhaging viewers for awhile now all of cable tv has
movies,not_removed,but check out this cool thing brady lebron or the sec did espn roll tide go cavs the greatest sports network ever s
movies,not_removed,do you really think that is due to disney in any way shape or form cable tv in general is suffering people are cutting cords every day and going to netflix hulu amazon hbo etc espn certainly over hired and over paid for its talent shit chris berman is probably the most overpaid person on tv however that just shows disneys good intent with the company when they moved to bristle and built a world class studio i doubt they expected the age of streaming im sure theyll adapt and survive however they still have some of the highest rating son cable with exclusive contracts with the nba mlb and monday night football
movies,not_removed,fuck olly
movies,not_removed,fuck olly
movies,not_removed,fook olly
movies,not_removed,it was the intro of and they spent a very long time building it up
movies,not_removed,i mean darth vader sells more toys than anyone and that dudes hitler
movies,not_removed,wait what
movies,not_removed,nope
movies,not_removed,no it did not
movies,not_removed,disney keeps it lucasfilm smart as many were worried the feels would not come with the castle animationlogo if disney keeps turning these ips into gold machines they will eventually just buy fox studios for the logo to put on the star wars films
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,thats true characters with feminine traits can be very strong and well written i suppose it only makes sense for people within traditional settings to possess the traits expected of their gender and to an extent its nice that men and women are unique in their own ways rather than everyone being just nonbinary interesting way of looking at it though i wonder how much itd matter if leia were a prince with inherently feminine traits simply because she was raised that way sorta like gwyndolin in dark souls itd definitely change peoples perceptions of the character for better or worse and could feel out of place so youre right but honestly i feel like leia is more masculine personality wise than traditionally feminine so perhaps it wouldnt matter i guess both androgynous characters and characters that lean towards the stereotypical traits of their gender can be written well you can play to different strengths while developing them brienne in asoiaf is so engaging and great because her personality defies everything her vagina might imply but without that shes just a generic knight ive rambled a bit but this a neat topic to discuss
movies,not_removed,all very valid points i feel like some of the best characters are ones that adhere to various traits that might be associated with their gender but then demonstrate qualities that might be unexpected of them from the opposite one a highly sensitive albeit brave man being one example or a woman who isnt stereotypically nurturing but cold whom has to use her wits to weasel out of situations because she cant reach the physical peak of a man i feel like those archetypes present a lot of depth yet would be fundamentally different if they swapped genders so youre right gender matters i hadnt really thought of it that way
movies,not_removed,oh yeah youre right that was a pretty significant plot point lol so yeah first class but you know what scene i mean
movies,not_removed,no no thats totally reliable they said it was a source and everyone knows that in journalism if you have a source that means its totally reliable evidence just like that marvel guy in a bar that reported they were making an ironfist netflix movie instead of a whole series
movies,not_removed,cant make a clickbait title about the troubled star wars movie production if you dont use the ambiguously ominous words
movies,not_removed,execute order
movies,not_removed,iger is not as forgiving as i am
movies,not_removed,yup and itll be really disappointing if disney does the lead switches side hurrdurr sequel route
movies,not_removed,how many bothan spies specifically
movies,not_removed,it is a dc movie they have a bad record the internet hivemind remembers that i for one think it looks awesome so given the dc track record lately outside of nolan i am hopeful but not too optimistic that is how i went into so it did not disappoint anyways the circle jerk doesnt like suicide squad because it is the hivemind which is very cynical and pessimistic this is reddit after all
movies,not_removed,looking at you george lucas
movies,not_removed,nearly any editor youll ever meet feels they saved every movie theyve ever worked on its a hollywood joke at this point they even sometimes say it as a joke before they give the award for best editing at the oscars and the crowd laughs its generally pretty true though only they know that guy that got the best actor oscar because they spliced together the best pieces of takes
movies,not_removed,one scene can throw off the whole scene sounds dubious
movies,not_removed,not even close to the most expensive movie of all time which was one of the pirates movies with being another one of the pirates movies this is both when adjusted and not adjusted for inflation httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofmostexpensivefilms
movies,not_removed,havent watched the movie yet i intend to but im honestly not too worried about anything being spoiled got a link to information about scenes being out of order sounds interesting
movies,not_removed,absolutely none of the scenes were out of order there was one scene that was confusing which was when you find out what luthor was doing in the alien ship when he first got access they didnt reveal it until right before the big showdown as a flashback they didnt scream flashback and so if you didnt realize that he wasnt wearing the same outfit as he was in the scene before it got confusing other than that scene and maybe one or two other lesser ones the complaints of the editing are entirely overblown
movies,not_removed,pirates of the caribbean is the most expensive movie of all time
movies,not_removed,the most expensive movie of all fucking time why the fuck do you people keep saying things like this bvs isnt anywhere close to being the most expensive movie of all time
movies,not_removed,were they really out of order
movies,not_removed,yep it was a conscious decision by hirsch to tell a complete story start to finish
movies,not_removed,its a little more disturbing when it happens to a human character rather than a cartoon sponge or starfish
movies,not_removed,the price of the popsicle
movies,not_removed,pretty much
movies,not_removed,hockey whats that silly people we will tell you the sports to be interested in luckily enough theyre the same ones that we have broadcasting rights for
movies,not_removed,implied yes but that was pre disney
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i can see it now episode special edition the only change is the addition of the century fox fanfare
movies,not_removed,ohhh i see it now been too busy hurping my derp
movies,not_removed,cause i need a han
movies,not_removed,exactly
movies,not_removed,friendly coworkers discuss reshooting some scenes and decide its a good idea then realize it means they will work again on a fun project and smile
movies,not_removed,wrong death star
movies,not_removed,it wasnt really a circle jerk the issue was that the bohemian rhapspdy trailer was drastically different from the comic con trailer which if you remember was super dark and moody and when people responded much better to the fun trailer suddenly there was a need for reshoots assumptions were made that the first cut of the film followed the dark and serious approach and that they did reshoots to add more jokes and fun into the film those are the kind of reshoots that can ruin a film look at fantastic execs demanded reshoots to switch the movie from the acifi thriller it was planned to be into a standard superhero flick and we got one of the most hastily thrown together third acts possible thats the worry people have about suicide squad that the films original vision was scrapped because of a good marketting team and that itll turn out a weird dark serious movie with comedic bits frankensteined into it
movies,not_removed,agreed gotta judge it on what you can see for example based on the trailer i think the new ghostbusters is gonna be bunk but based on the suicide squad trailer good god man that shit looks yummy like a more dysfunctional guardians of the galaxy
movies,not_removed,oh man did you see that footage of him editing the prequel episodes hes in the editing room literally changing everything every line of dialogue every background every movement they make whos in which scene its nuts edit the editor doesnt sound too pleased about this relationship george has with the abilities of digital editing
movies,not_removed,oh john carterwhat were you thinking that budget is so crazyi mean the movie isnt that bad and it was definitely mismarketed but that budgetlook at the other films around it batman spiderman pirates and harry potter these are big franchises with big characters that people know and love no one knows who the fuck john carter of mars is how did they expect to break even on that madness
movies,not_removed,people on reddit are now just making up bullshit facts to hate on bvs its embarassing
movies,not_removed,ill say this if you go into it thinking time for the biggest piece of crap in my life like reddit built it as youll come out liking it more than you expect yes the editing was horrible and it really looks like they forgot superman was supposed to have a role in the film but anyone who says the batman scenes themselves werent amazing is lying
movies,not_removed,as someone who just saw it yesterday no idea what was supposed to be out of order the editing is weird for sure but the worst i think of as far as being out of order is theres one or two weird flashback things that happened that it took me a minute to realize were flashbacks
movies,not_removed,ive heard but didnt notice myself that there were scenes that would have made more sense being closer together and characters were wearing the same clothes suggesting they were meant to be but in the final cut they were a ways apart
movies,not_removed,no this guys just jerkin it
movies,not_removed,i remember him wanting it to be three seasons and a movie
movies,not_removed,espns obsession with the sec and double standards regarding their analysts is whats killing their ratings
movies,not_removed,kylo ren is a guy who wants to be hitler analogue if not less of a nice guy i see where youre coming from though
movies,not_removed,darth vader is scarier in star wars rebels than he ever was in the movies hes an unstoppable juggernaut and the only option the main characters have is to run the fuck away
movies,not_removed,oh i thought that person was referring to the actor playing the punisher
movies,not_removed,this is so cheery it sounds like the onion making fun of this headline in a stunning turn of events actors have gotten together to finish off their movie in a way that makes the best product possible sources on set told us that while the hours were long they got frequent breaks and the director was generally reasonable to work with
movies,not_removed,id so click that
movies,not_removed,cant we have one week per year where all headlines are like this
movies,not_removed,i knew i should have taken that left turn at coruscant
movies,not_removed,yeah the look on that guys face
movies,not_removed,its not exactly a terrible technique its just when done by someone who just wants to be lazy rather than doing something interesting with it of course its gonna end up being awful
movies,not_removed,george kind of had a point in that scene though panaka moving and nudging quigon just to take a seat was kind of disrupting the scene editor even praised it later on having its benefits allowing some shots to be saved and what doesnt work discardedin this case masking out the rest of the seated panaka scene
movies,not_removed,i actually loved john carter the story wasnt original but my god did disney mess the marketing up all they had to do was add of mars like the damn book
movies,not_removed,i didnt even like it much but the extra hate towards it sort of makes me like it more its the seasons sansa stark of movies
movies,not_removed,what if i go into it thinking reddit hates it so i will like it more than i expect will i hate it or love it
movies,not_removed,ill say this if you go into it thinking time for the biggest piece of crap in my life like reddit built it as youll come out liking it more than you expect thats how i felt it wasnt great but it was watchable and there were some cool scenes civil war was the opposite for me i went in expecting greatest action movie of all time i left a bit disappointed i enjoyed it i love superhero movies but i didnt think it was the best captain america movie let alone the best marvel movie in general which is what everyone and their dog said it would be too many flaws to be that good imo
movies,not_removed,well theres a rumor based on the clothes that lex wears that during the dinner party where bruce and clark meet was actually later in the day from when he learned about darkseid and all that as that scene shows him wearing the same clothes thats why when he talked on the stage he went off on about now having power or something similar and seemed incoherent
movies,not_removed,i dont think anything was out of order but as you said with it taking a while to realize you were watching a flashback there isnt a very good flow to the film
movies,not_removed,to me it was because it violently jumps from one thing to the next without any setup or even establishing shots many times to me it felt like big chunks of the movie were missing the thing just has really bad flow
movies,not_removed,i think it was originally supposed to be three seasons but pretty early into season fans figured out the twist that was going to be the season finale so rather than dragging things out he combined and
movies,not_removed,i got way more of a nazi vibe from the first order
movies,not_removed,kylo has the hitler histrionic tantrum thing down
movies,not_removed,does the whole first sequence in inglorious basterds count because if so thats definitely it
movies,not_removed,goodfellas has to rank up there
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,my favorite introduction scene of course comes from the famous plasma celluloid sexon zaxon of urr in which firaxon escapes from the stomach of the slackgait gorathon by pulling on its vestral ligaments until its navalgorps retracted loosening the glanial sphincter and allowing firaxons escape but not before being covered in tranziofluid talk about a sticky situation am i right fellow humans
movies,not_removed,my names turkish
movies,not_removed,the matrix that first scene with trinity gets you hooked
movies,not_removed,pulp fiction
movies,not_removed,lord of war the assembly line of bullets
movies,not_removed,would have to say the opening of drive could be a short film itself
movies,not_removed,seven psychopathsthe whole larrytommy conversation was hilarious
movies,not_removed,not really the whole scene but the accelerating drum roll to open whiplash really drew me in and i think set the tone for the rest of the film
movies,not_removed,the darjeeling limited
movies,not_removed,one that is definitely up there is the and the subsequent httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvreanifaac that monologue and the accompanying images plus the music best score of all the mad max movies are so evocative and haunting it feels like i really am watching something that has already happened
movies,not_removed,while i admit the intro from mad max as mentioned by ulesamourainouvelle is simply stunning in its bleakness the intro from the latest film in the series sets the tone for the film better than anything else i would like to give an honorable mention to yes the game for having an amazing intro provided by griffa one of the characters you meet with a bit of action as is typical with video game intros
movies,not_removed,the opening to boogie nights is phenomenal httpsmyoutubecomwatchviixtfyzqvqq
movies,not_removed,ive always loved the opening to the way of the gun it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie but perfectly sums up the two main characters
movies,not_removed,commando people getting killed left and right and my brother and i were laughing our asses off
movies,not_removed,definitely have to say the remake of dawn of the dead the song makes it
movies,not_removed,the dark knights opening is the best part of the entire movie which says a lot but honestly you cant beat the intro to a space odyssey i cant think of a more iconic opening scene
movies,not_removed,opening scene of quantum of solace just car engines and great scenery no dialogue crank the volume and enjoy some good sound design
movies,not_removed,always love the opening for i dont know if its my favourite but its the first that leaps to mind
movies,not_removed,without a doubt my favourite its amazing
movies,not_removed,as far back as i can remember i always wanted to be a gangster memorable one for sure
movies,not_removed,shut up keymaster
movies,not_removed,this has gone way over my head please clarify
movies,not_removed,starfire
movies,not_removed,thats tommy he tells people he was named after a gun but i know he was really named after a famous century ballet dancer
movies,not_removed,i love this movie
movies,not_removed,hes my partner that doesnt mean we hold hands or take windy walks along the beach
movies,not_removed,those do happen a lot the can we stop topics happen a lot too and so do comments pointing that out in the words of the great dr vindaloo theres nothing to worry about theres nothing i can do
movies,not_removed,no just ignore them have a nice night ok
movies,not_removed,i think the biggest problem i have with threads like that is that they always link to a youtube video of that scene maybe im the odd man out around here but when im redditing i have no interest in stopping to watch a video a video of any kind and yes dudes that includes your attempts at being the next film analysis channel a la every frame a painting so you can stop now nobodys watchin
movies,not_removed,its the same situation as with coffee flavored candy no one is forcing you to eat it so dont complain about it dont like it dont look at it
movies,not_removed,yes can we stop everything nobody say or post anything anymore anywhere because somewhere someone will be upset about it instead of maybe you know ignoring something were not interested in and let those who are have their moment
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i dont mind it if the op at least attempts to tell us why heshe feels said way about that scene most people on here just vaguely posts a video clip with a clickbaity title for the karma
movies,not_removed,im just here waiting to find out what is
movies,not_removed,can we stop the posts
movies,not_removed,theyre really cool maybe you should just unsub do those subs that are often in sub movies or films maybe youre not that interested like the rest of us swerve
movies,not_removed,yes all posts should be catered to the user just like facebook i love their algorithm the ads really focuses on me as a person too
movies,not_removed,why do the titles occupy a big space in your screen why dont you just look past them like noncunty people do
movies,not_removed,yeah i totally agree with this i think those sorts of topics fit better as a text post where they explain it or at least have a comment with a nice paragraph or two about why they think the movies scene is great
movies,not_removed,because it came out when people were young or they saw it when they were young
movies,not_removed,nostalgia is like putting cocaine infused marbles into your mouth in that it makes you say stupid things —yahtzee
movies,not_removed,i have only ever seen it ridiculed on this site but people tend to fondly remember the original because of tim currys portrayal of pennywise which was stellar thats really what people are looking towards with this new one it isnt whether the cast can pull it together because a feature length film is going to have much stronger direction than a tv movie the actors obviously werent the problem you had some heavy hitters for their time in that movie the writing and direction was to blame but tim curry carried it singlehandedly people dont think of the book when you say pennywise even if theyve read it they think of tim curry in a subpar movie his role was legendary so the new pennywise actor has excuse the pun very large shoes to fill not many people could tell you the cast of that movie or what particularly made it rough around the edges but they can damn well tell you tim currys role was iconic
movies,not_removed,nostalgia
movies,not_removed,i dont
movies,not_removed,i will always have respect for the interpretation but to answer your question i really dont know this production of it is using modern technology and is finally getting on the big screenhow could you not be excited if youre a fan or have read the book nostalgia and pessimism seems to be the answer some people just like going against the crowd
movies,not_removed,i get a sense that most people who allegedly love the old it havent even seen the entire thing and have only seen the pennywise scenes on youtube this movie really doesnt have a lot to live up to which is why its perfect to be rebooted
movies,not_removed,i still like it but it does go downhill really fast and suddenly i love it for the same reason i love other dumb horror movies the only difference is how awesome tim curry is as it thats about all
movies,not_removed,i think its only really remembered for a select few scenes as a whole people forgot that its a minseries made for tv and it certainly shows but it has a somewhat cult following solely from a handful of scenes featuring pennywise
movies,not_removed,to be honest i dont know i wanna do what others in this thread are saying and blame nostalgia but it is weird currys performance to me is the only good thing about it the rest is pretty aggressively mediocre to downright bad thats why im excited for the reboot looks like theyre actually going to make a scary movie
movies,not_removed,the color grading was practically nonexistent jesus this is an actual complaint you do know that it wasnt as easy to do back in when it aired right color grading only really became something that could be done easier in the late early o brother where art thou was the first with digital color grading and it took weeks to do
movies,not_removed,a different time it was released in it was crap by the standards of its day it was crap by the standards of previous decades its just not very good
movies,not_removed,you did a very good job answering his question
movies,not_removed,well forgive me for that complaint but the lighting was just plain terrible
movies,not_removed,hollywood used to be really good at making great glossy midbudget thrillers the fugitive arlington road the river wild misery etc now i feel like those type of films have to be ultra low budget festival fare
movies,not_removed,watching hail caesar earlier this year made me wish for more swords and sandals movies with decent scripts tho looks at benhur
movies,not_removed,big budget rrated action movies in the vein of speedcon aircliffhanger
movies,not_removed,weve seen a lack of futuristic shitty society full of gangs movies lately robocop johnny mnemonic predator and pretty much any other movie from the and early we need a good old fashioned bloodintheneonstreets flick edit i suppose we have dredd but it wasnt ridiculous enough though it was awesome
movies,not_removed,fairytales i dont mean fairytales with a new kick to it i mean actual old fashioned fairytales with new cinematographic technology i would love to see my childhood classics in a new polished look
movies,not_removed,something not a sequel or a remakereimagining i know im dreaming
movies,not_removed,music
movies,not_removed,and action blockbusters featuring regular dudes with smartass attitudes doing superhuman shit and never getting hurt
movies,not_removed,gloriously dumb movies like airplane the naked gun series hot shots loaded weapon and top secret not direct parodies exactly but really goofy with a lot of sight gags dialogue misdirection and truly ridiculous physical comedy
movies,not_removed,filmnoir springs to mind as it covers a wide range of aspects id like to see be more prevalent in film firstly good use of shadow and light to make compelling scenes that really narrow the viewers focus to the thrill fright etc of the character ie dementia or the third man secondly good mysteries are hard to come by nowadays i feel like too many films focus on the mindbending aspect when dealing with the genre moreso than fleshing out a good old fashioned whodunnit lastly while it is so commonplace now to have characters that exhibit and moral ambiguity the sense of conflict with ones self in filmnoir was a wonderful aspect that i think is now overlooked as it is what we are used to basically im asking that the coen brothers start making everything and throwing out all of those fantastic references and homages to the great noir films that preceded them
movies,not_removed,educational comedies like trading places and father of the bride movies that have a point but also make you laugh it seems most comedy now just have a pure political agenda and shock value with zero constructive message therein
movies,not_removed,i would love to see a super dumb throwback to john woo style action movies of think hard boiled or perhaps a cronenbergstyle body horror film
movies,not_removed,science fiction comedies like back to the future and the fifth element teen movies like heathers breakfast club and american pie
movies,not_removed,funny movies that are actually funny
movies,not_removed,historical docudramas journalism thrillers heist crews entertainment industry movies and gods to honest ninjas would be nice to see get more green lights
movies,not_removed,fantasy movies in the vein of lord of the rings i dont mean in terms of adaptations but i mean in just general quality and execution the hobbit movies could have been these had jackson not been screwed over by the studio so badly
movies,not_removed,musicals we usually get one every other year but they pander to the broadway crowd rarely does a studio really try with them with quality for a mainstream audience les miserable and chicago did a good job but hairspray phantom rent and the producers were all cashing in on their popularity without any effort put into the film not by the studio anyway beauty and the beast and la la land hopefully spur studios into considering musicals viable again
movies,not_removed,prisoners
movies,not_removed,does gone girl qualify for what youre talking about
movies,not_removed,side effects
movies,not_removed,they either go big or go home these days a thriller has to be about some earthshattering secret or its banished to a festival the fugitive was very personal a dude is framed for his wifes death the stakes are small but yet large today the stakes are high but the personal element is small what we need to do is get back to telling stories about the people not the events
movies,not_removed,everything would get compared to gladiator years old and still the most recent milestone of the genre

movies,not_removed,good one someone else mentioned side effects racking my brains i guess you could throw the lincoln lawyer in there clearly they occasionally do get made and i really enjoyed all three of those movies which makes it all the more shitty that they are so infrequent now when once upon a time they were bread and butter
movies,not_removed,its more of a prestige drama than a straight up thriller but its probably as close as ive seen
movies,not_removed,are we ignoring
movies,not_removed,oh man good news
movies,not_removed,isnt nice guys based on something
movies,not_removed,agreed walk hard holds up
movies,not_removed,well now i feel dumb for not just saying that surely i could have spent more time thinking about terminology
movies,not_removed,no the nice guys is a shane black thing war dogs was based on a book
movies,not_removed,the book was written later then the screenplay the basis for the film was just a magazinearticle

movies,not_removed,christina ricci from casper the daughter from alf and amanda bynes all of them are older than me so its not weird
movies,not_removed,danny larusso
movies,not_removed,godzilla the trailer makes it look like bryan cranston was a lead character and there would be more godzilla screen time it was about the marines mostly the marines
movies,not_removed,fight club the marketing made it sound like a movie just about underground fighting
movies,not_removed,brave i thought it was gonna be something like mulan but it ended being about the mum turning into a bear
movies,not_removed,in bruge one of my absolute favourite films but advertised as a kind of buddy cop style comedy action in actuality it was a very melancholy story of redemption and resurrection fucking love that film also amazing use of the ol swear words throughout
movies,not_removed,edge of tomorrow had a boring ass trailer that put off so many people i remember people were mocking the trailer calling it elysium thr marketing showed none of the humor and awesomeness of the movie from that time i learn to wait at least for the reviews and not dismiss a movie because of its trailer
movies,not_removed,the kangaroo will be the star of kangaroo jack cillian murphy is maybe playing the devil in red eye hitchcock will be the movie you want it to be adventureland will be superbad in an amusement park marvels really gonna change things up with iron man and the villain looks great man of steel the thinking mans superhero movie liam neeson will spend two hours fighting wolves in the grey marvels really gonna change things up with age of ultron and the villain looks great youre really gonna root for chris pratt in passengers
movies,not_removed,crimson peak definitely the trailers really made it look like a horror film its romance i think if more people knew that going in it would have been better enjoyed
movies,not_removed,toys starring robin williams as an inventor of toys fun family movie right wrong
movies,not_removed,suicide squad but i think it was due to them changing the storyline at the hour the change to a projokerharley ending was a terrible decision among other things cough enchantress cough imo
movies,not_removed,bridge to terabithia
movies,not_removed,the village marketing really played up the horrormonster elements but it is really a nice characterdriven film with an m night twist
movies,not_removed,be kind rewind marketing really latched on to the sweding thing which isnt really the main focus of the story especially when the act hits
movies,not_removed,im surprised no mention of bicentennial man yet they showed it as being a comedy featuring a wacky robot butler
movies,not_removed,is no one going to mention collateral beauty
movies,not_removed,hail caesar solaris
movies,not_removed,drive
movies,not_removed,iron man
movies,not_removed,im expecting downvotes for this but ive always thought deadpools marketing was funnier than the actual movie
movies,not_removed,into the woods when gf said she wanted to see it she showed me a trailer it was dark there were monsters and a witch and no one sang i got into the theater and that fat british dude from latenight tv started singing after a minute i thought why is he still singing it went on like that for hours insipid
movies,not_removed,passengers annapolis
movies,not_removed,i remember a bunch of my friends in my freshman year of high school went to go see this new horror movie that was coming out it ended up being catfish like the mtv show
movies,not_removed,a monster calls trailers seem to suggest its a full on fantasy with some action was not prepared for how emotional and depressing the movie becomes at times in saying that it was better than i thought it was going to be
movies,not_removed,when i saw the trailer to prometheus i got really psyched because a lot of it reminded me of the stylistic choices made by scott for alien so naturally when i went to see it i was expecting exactly that a good thriller and horror film with a sophisticated undertone in the end it became a very complicated story about the birth of mankind which poses an interesting discussion in and of itself but was not what i wanted nor imho very well executed at all
movies,not_removed,the international they had this good script of a investigationpolitical film got a top notch cast and director then the shit studioproducers decided to add some pointless action scenes in reshoots and the films poster was trying to sell this bourne image when it wasnt further from the truth
movies,not_removed,tomorrowland i thought the title land was going to be part of the whole movie but was just seen in two of three scenes
movies,not_removed,catfish
movies,not_removed,sweeny todds marketing made it look like a dark horror style film and i dont remember any mention of singing in the trailers
movies,not_removed,a lowbudget mystery drama marketed as a comedy i cant for the life of me figure out how they thought baitandswitch would help them make a profit on this film they did not have enough of an ad budget to sell this film their only real chance was word of mouth but by getting people in the seats expecting to see a comedy and then hitting them with a fairly slow developing drama most people walked out within minutes and told anyone who asked dont waste your money marketing aside this is a very unappreciated film i really enjoyed it from beginning to end the mystery was intriguing and the reveal at the end was satisfying in every way more than i can say for most mystery movies even ones costing hundreds of times as much to make btw if you want to see how misleading the marketing was watch the trailer then watch it again with the sound off you can really see then that this is a drama not funny in any way
movies,not_removed,drive
movies,not_removed,drive still a masterpiece imo
movies,not_removed,million dollar baby but really it was the only way to make it work i still loved that film even though it wasnt what i thought it would be
movies,not_removed,iron man thought i was going to get a bad ass science vs magic battle age of ultron thought i was going to get comic book ultron battle los angles thought i was going to get a band of brothersblack hawk down meets alien invasion
movies,not_removed,the american with george clooney sold as an actiony thriller about an assassin when it was actually a very contemplative characterdriven story about a tired assassin who tries to leave the game an excellent movie but probably not what the public or the studio thought they were getting
movies,not_removed,bug it was marketed as a horror film maybe thats what made people hate it but its one of my favorites
movies,not_removed,eyes wide shut
movies,not_removed,i dont really watch the trailer for the martian but the viral marketing personally made the film was gonna be a very serious psychological drama in space i was surprised when i watched the movie and found it pretty lighthearted and had a lot of funny moments
movies,not_removed,the trailer for fences is very misleading the movie you see in the trailer isnt what you get in the theater
movies,not_removed,most recent one is passengers was marketed as a space thriller with something sinister in the back ground was actually a loveredemption story in the backdrop of space
movies,not_removed,dark water it was marketed as a horror film in the same vein as the ring instead it was a bleak and depressing psychological character study with a supernatural subplot shoehorned in
movies,not_removed,collateral beauty
movies,not_removed,suicide squad
movies,not_removed,days the sandra bullock movie not the danny boyle horror film the movie is pretty damn heavy and is more of a straight up drama about a woman struggling with addiction including constant flashbacks to her growing up with an alcoholic mom the trailer and tv spots really played up the comedy and made it seem much more lighthearted than it really was
movies,not_removed,suicide squad promised a fun movie but what we got was the equivalent of a trip to the dentist
movies,not_removed,the accountant was marketed imo as an action movie and i was blown away after seeing it because the action was totally absent until the end even the poster just gave off a total action movie vibe
movies,not_removed,cable guy
movies,not_removed,kick ass
movies,not_removed,oh god the first teaser trailer was totally different too set such a dark and serious tone it was the only trailer i watched biggest movie disappointment ever edit
movies,not_removed,should be retitled to marines with special appearances of bryan cranston and godzilla
movies,not_removed,shit not only was it not about cranston the marketing made it look like it was going to be a movie about godzilla
movies,not_removed,i believe thats one of the things fincher mentions in the commentary that the studio marketed the film to a completely wrong audience
movies,not_removed,i caught it in the cinema because three kings was sold out i was gutted until i saw it i did eventually see three kings thought it was garbage
movies,not_removed,maybe it wasnt a good marketing technique but that helped to that plot twist be completely unexpected
movies,not_removed,but it ended being about the mum turning into a bear dont forget the bear fight at the end
movies,not_removed,agreed i went in expecting an adventure and journey and instead i got a trounce through the back yard with mom
movies,not_removed,i actually liked that one you thought it would be about the princess being a strong woman but it just ended up being an intimate film about a girl and her mother learning to accept one another although one is an animal i mean i dont think anybody saw the bear twist coming
movies,not_removed,dont fucking make me have to leave a fucking message with the fucking receptionist or there will be fucking hell to pay im fucking telling you jeez he swears a lot doesnt he
movies,not_removed,dont you call my kids cunts
movies,not_removed,to add to this i came into this thread to make sure someone had said edge of tomorrow if youre a scifiwithaplot kinda person and you thought this was just a tom cruise action flick and didnt see it change that right now its a damn good scifi film with a lot of intricacy when me and my friends watched it we were blown away by how badly they had fucked up the marketing for it best example of this weve witnessed
movies,not_removed,the marketing really hindered an otherwise excellent action movie saw it recently and i was blown away at how clever the premise actually was
movies,not_removed,i knew absolutely nothing about this movie from the marketing other than tom cruise is in a robot suit
movies,not_removed,wait you think listening to reviews is any more reliable youd rather have somebody tell you what you are supposed to think about a movie why not just watch it
movies,not_removed,liam neeson will spend two hours fighting wolves in the grey to be fair what we got was stellar though the grey is such a good movie
movies,not_removed,adventureland was still great
movies,not_removed,hitchcock hancock
movies,not_removed,the trailer was like that but in pretty much the first scene they spell it out when mia says it is not so much a ghost story but a story with ghosts in it
movies,not_removed,i think that movie was quite weak generally i knew it was a gothic romance and im a total sucker for romantic films but ive never been so goddamn bored during a film before completely unengaging
movies,not_removed,you should really listen to the how did this get made episode for this one of their better ones and that movie is bananas it also really describes how it go made and is pretty funny
movies,not_removed,why whats it about
movies,not_removed,the use of multiple things that you see middle aged people share on facebook pretty much killed that movie for me i just thought the writing was terrible
movies,not_removed,uggghhhhh
movies,not_removed,to be fair that was a childrens book that they adapted so the marketing was targeting children
movies,not_removed,i really enjoyed this film but did not enjoy the twist
movies,not_removed,i was going to post this as i felt lied to by the trailers i was expecting some slapstick comedy with jack black and mos def but i got a sappy danny glover neighborhood gentrification flick was still ok though
movies,not_removed,i think everyones just trying to forget about that one
movies,not_removed,i cant believe how far i had to scroll to find this the expectations versus reality are staggering
movies,not_removed,i just read its wikipedia entry how does this shit get made
movies,not_removed,why hail caesar
movies,not_removed,right looked like a cool action caper ended up being a cool sexy ryan gosling character movie
movies,not_removed,or age of ultron
movies,not_removed,i think youve got a perfectly valid opinion there albeit one i disagree with but i dont think the marketing really misrepresents or deviates from the film whether they like the movie or not the trailers give a pretty accurate picture of what you can expect from the movie
movies,not_removed,im expecting downvotes for this but ive always thought deadpools marketing was funnier than the actual movie its a fair criticism i just disagree with it since humor is subjective it presented exactly what you where going to get in the movie sidenote why did it originally copy a comment from the top of the page
movies,not_removed,i think the marketing was clever and some maybe most of the humor in deadpool was not but they threw enough at me that i enjoyed it
movies,not_removed,dont see it the way you do but its interesting that the first posters of deadpool were like a romantic movie they did it on purpose of course
movies,not_removed,the trailer more or less lays out the exact plot of the movie beat for beat
movies,not_removed,in all fairness musicals never market with any of their songs
movies,not_removed,reminds me of when i went into les mis not knowing it was a musical what a fun three hours
movies,not_removed,sweeney todd similarly had some trailers that featured zero singing or indictation that it was a musical
movies,not_removed,but the was full of singing
movies,not_removed,what is front with musicals and they did have clips of the songs before they came out
movies,not_removed,thank you i got dragged to this by the wife and her sister there was no mention of this being a musical by them or the previews nightmare before christmas pulled this same stunt i was jazzed when it started up in the theater and several minutes in started wondering when the singing was going to stop
movies,not_removed,i thought reddit circlejerk loved lalaland i guess musicale are okay only when we decide so
movies,not_removed,in the trailer i remember chris pratt saying i think theres a reason we woke up early and kinda leading into a shady corporation idea when it was just some fuckery with the computers
movies,not_removed,i thought the trailers looked depressing i might just be a little clued in to that vibe since i immediately noticed his mom being sick
movies,not_removed,also the prometheus trailer spoils some key moments from the film not least the fucking ending
movies,not_removed,i always felt like it was the beginning of a franchise that didnt exist so it forgot to be a good movie that stands on its own
movies,not_removed,i mean its a really wellknown musical so thats kinda on you
movies,not_removed,eh bettle los angles gets a lot of flakk its not that bad
movies,not_removed,i thought it was going to be a horror movie about giant killer bugs was so pleasantly surprised to get something different
movies,not_removed,really is it not an accurate adaptation of the play because the trailer seemed tonally deadon
movies,not_removed,my wife and i went into the movie expecting the sinister plot also
movies,not_removed,wow you really thought rhodey was going to die why would they show that in the trailer
movies,not_removed,just because rhodey didnt die doesnt mean there arent consequences
movies,not_removed,interesting choice however super was more removed from me the trailer made it look like a lighter comedy version of kick ass whereas the movie is actually a lot darker and more twisted
movies,not_removed,i remember getting free tickets to this film for some reason was in leeds and a friend rang me to say he had freebies like two weeks before general release
movies,not_removed,that would have been such a better movie i have to say the halo jump marines teaser was spectacular too one of the most atmospheric in the last five years at least
movies,not_removed,im a huge godzilla fan and while i still enjoyed the actual film that trailer is probably my favorite godzillarelated media in the entire franchise
movies,not_removed,to be fair who do you market it to
movies,not_removed,dont ask questions just go watch it trust me
movies,not_removed,its a psychological thriller about a man going against consumerism society sort of but its got a lot of charm and a great soundtrack its the kind of movie that teenage boys see it and it changes their lives but the more jaded you are the less impact it has still a gorgeous movie though very ahead of its time when it came out
movies,not_removed,natalie harry its a inanimate fucking object harry youre an inanimate fuckin object
movies,not_removed,leave my kids fucking out of it what have they done you fucking retract that bit about my cunt fucking kids
movies,not_removed,i thought the marketing was fine its exactly what i expected an action movie with tom the god cruise with the concept that he keeps repeating the day
movies,not_removed,yeah i see how badly worded my comment was but in my experience there has never been a movie on rt with or above that i didnt like so i am basing it on my experience especially if the trailers were lukewarm a movie critic is more reliable imo over just judging a trailer because they give you the general idea of what worked or not verse a min trailer that can be at times misleading its not the ideal approach but its how i do it also i ignore critics if the movie premise is interesting to me
movies,not_removed,it had a lot more substance than what they were advertising so that was a welcome surprise
movies,not_removed,i always mix up will smith and anthony hopkins
movies,not_removed,to each their own personally i loved it it was probably my favourite movie of last year
movies,not_removed,one of my favorites wasnt anything i expected i would watch robin williams open an envelope as a kid so i saw it pretty early on but i loved it in a weird melancholy way
movies,not_removed,robin williams lives in a toy factory and his father dies his military general uncle wants to start making war toys so robin his sister joan cusack and robins love interest go to war using wind up toys that films weirdness gave me an existential crisis when i was a kid also l l cool j hides randomly for no reason
movies,not_removed,normal is just a setting on the dryer
movies,not_removed,still the trailers were very purposefully misleading they billed it as a narniaish fantasy movie where kids meet giants and punch wolves in the face with a giant gauntlet in reality those scenes are all just the kids imagination theyre like of the movie or less and most of the movie is about regular kids going to school and being bullied and not getting along with their dad
movies,not_removed,oh shit that bad looked really good
movies,not_removed,well the trailer made it look like it wasnt going to be absolutely dreadful seriously though the trailers show actors who are barely in five minutes of the film and didnt really show that the focus of the film was the hollywood executive or hint that it was almost an anthology of barely connected stories
movies,not_removed,fucking rock of ages broke me
movies,not_removed,ill bet you were les miserables
movies,not_removed,im guessing there were numerous trailers this movie in particular could be portrayed as entirely different films a horror movie a comedy a musical a whimsical johnny depp costume fantasy i mentioned in another reply i would probably never see a trailer with music in it unless for some reason they start showing musical trailers between episodes of the wire
movies,not_removed,well admittedly i knew it was disneyrelated i knew who was in it and i still went to appease the gf i may have seen the trailer and blocked it out i still contend that i was tricked somehow russian hackers probably
movies,not_removed,i think weve seen the use of trailers evolve a lot in the last few years in how they are tested and tailored to audiences even changed during the campaign since everything is digital now its a lot easier to recut and make an overnight change or send out many different versions depending on what movie they accompany or what tv show is on when they are broadcast i am a throwback a caveman who only watches guy shows crime war scifi history yes i know they are not exclusively guy shows so i would probably never see the same ad that airs on lifetime or the oprah channel network is it just called o see thats how much i know
movies,not_removed,its almost like different people enjoy different movies
movies,not_removed,its almost like good movies are better than bad movies
movies,not_removed,and also he ought to know why she woke up early lol i dunno how to hide spoilers
movies,not_removed,that line combined with the sos morse code in the ads and posters had me thinking there was another ship like theirs that had broken downbeen abandoned in deep space and they had figured out a way to hail pratts ship and wake people up maybe some sunshineevent horizon space madness oh well
movies,not_removed,my wife and i thought the same thing that trailer was misleading for sure
movies,not_removed,couple of people tried suing wb saying they didnt know it would be a musical
movies,not_removed,people are saying the same thing about into the woods which is also a well known musical and bridge to terabithia which as been a commonly read childrens book for well over years so apparently doing any sort of research ahead of time about movies in a time when a lot of stuff is not new ip is hard
movies,not_removed,while it is well known and even more so now i think it is totally reasonable that not everyone in had heard of it im not really into musicals and i would never have heard of it before the movie if not for it being a plot point in jersey girl
movies,not_removed,it ends extremely sadly
movies,not_removed,yes it is
movies,not_removed,some of the worst action scenes ever put to film
movies,not_removed,well i didnt realize there was a play until i watched the movie the trailer was very intense and the movie is not very exciting ever
movies,not_removed,as much as i like that moviethere pretty much arent lol everything that actually happens ends up having a big but tony and cap have totally split from each other and had a big fightbut then it ends with an lol well hang out again when we need to fight something letter rhodey is hurtand then is literally already walking by the end of the movie cap and bucky are finally friends again tony hates buckybut bucky is just gonna be frozen again all of caps friends are in prisonbut he breaks them out in one second its a fun movie but for me it was really brought down by undoing everything of consequence in the last minutes
movies,not_removed,i felt like kick ass marketing really didnt reflect what i watched maybe i just took it the wrong way youre totally correct with super marketing was dumbed down to reach the masses
movies,not_removed,edgy teens
movies,not_removed,if you know its a psychological thriller before seen it you wont enjoy it that much
movies,not_removed,im sorry i called you an inanimate object i was upset
movies,not_removed,its really so much more than just tom cruise repeats his day and dies a lot
movies,not_removed,yeah if its over then theres a good chance youll like it i was more talking about the reverse you could still like something with or even lower on rotten tomato depending on the movie and your tastes
movies,not_removed,well that sounds interesting
movies,not_removed,this is a brilliant summary im actually very intrigued to watch this now remember it being on tv once and being wierded out expected like live action toy story
movies,not_removed,delete my browsing history
movies,not_removed,i had a big smile on my face pretty much the entire film
movies,not_removed,boooo boo i say i adored hail caesar granted it does play rather like a series of comic sketches as opposed to a wholly coherent film but dammit they were great sketches mostly
movies,not_removed,you should give hail caesar another shot i didnt like it much in theaters but ive since seen it again and it really grew on me
movies,not_removed,oh its that bad i was going to watch it on the plane lol
movies,not_removed,the main character is clearly josh brolin the start of the trailer is his confessional scene then it sets up the future baird whitlocks kidnapping and that brolins character has to do something about it pretty straightforward imo
movies,not_removed,or as americans would say le mizherabels
movies,not_removed,maybe i just take my east coast liberal elitist upbringing for granted
movies,not_removed,the avengers are pretty much completely disbanded tony is left emotionally shattered not to mention his ptsd and anxiety and shit vision just shot his own team member and is dealing with finding emotions rhodey is still recuperating black widow is missing spiderman has been thrust back into his daily life but now he wants more all of the others are criminals on the run hawkeye cant go back to his family bucky is frozen black panther has let outsiders into his country and may be considered to be aiding in criminal activity scarlet witch is like idk pretty young and shes now an outlaw too cap is also pretty wrecked emotionally and the accords are still in place meaning nobody can do anything the conflict was in no way resolved and there were most definitely consequences
movies,not_removed,i mean if suicide squad is any indication
movies,not_removed,no it really isnt
movies,not_removed,you should see it that description was not inaccurate but not entirely accurate either it would be really hard describe the movie for better or for worse i personally liked it you might not but i can almost guarantee that it will be unlike anything youve ever seen
movies,not_removed,it was definitely a much darker comedy than the trailers let you to believe
movies,not_removed,its actually really good in my opinion the misleading marketing is that it makes it look like a bunch of actors putting together a heist to save george clooney but its not that at all
movies,not_removed,i mean its at on rt so obviously some people liked it despite what the trailers show its about josh brolin as a film executive tying up the loose ends of the whacky antics goldenage hollywood stars are getting up to as a coen brothers fan i was disappointed and bored but your mileage may vary
movies,not_removed,i really enjoyed it true its disjointed and some of the acting borders on mugging for the camera it does however have many of the endearing hallmarks and snappy dialogue of a coen bros film the scene where bolin hosts the focus group with the religious heads is one of the funniest coen scenes ever imo
movies,not_removed,its not bad its just one of the coen brothers bfilms as opposed to one of their masterpieces if you enjoy their movies like burn after reading or the ladykillers youll probably like it it has a great look and some very funny moments
movies,not_removed,i was really disappointed on my first watch but after several successive watches i work on a cruise ship and they played it on one of the crew tv channels multiple times a day for a solid week straight its grown on me a lot i still think it has some very significant shortcomings and would be much better if they either cut several side plots out or instead turned it into a tv show to fully flesh them out but i disagree with the guy saying its terrible if you like other coen material youll probably enjoy it
movies,not_removed,come on everybody already knows the villain is snyder
movies,not_removed,kneel before zack
movies,not_removed,i dont think youve ever actually seen a villain before except for maybe in the movies
movies,not_removed,ok im lost wheres that from
movies,not_removed,i kind of ad libbed what ben stiller says in dodgeball he says the same thing but instead of villain its
movies,not_removed,who cares films should be judged by their content not the race of the director
movies,not_removed,more than most
movies,not_removed,i have seen of those listed it would have been an interesting contrast to see a comparison between that list and say overall top picks just going off of imdbs top rated id seen from there but thats not really a fair comparison
movies,not_removed,batty batty batty ive seen hollywood shuffle
movies,not_removed,nothing against the others but none really look like anything i need to run out and see either
movies,not_removed,i watch movies by directors i dont care about their race
movies,not_removed,i skimmed at least either way i should step my game up
movies,not_removed,i find lists like this minutely more irritating every year and have only recently realized how much that has to do with being racially mixed and not relating to anyone about anything through race ever ever ever these conversations are so profoundly boring to me that the fact they still occur causes a contradictory situation such that i find the comments interesting and often funny depressing but funny my racially ambiguous response to this is why i have not and will never watch a movie based on or even take into consideration the race of the director actors or production crew i watch what i find interesting and have limited time
movies,not_removed,yikes ive only seen i guarantee i have seen more than that on the top white director list some ill never see ad i cant stand terry mcmillan others though i have no excuse for not seeing
movies,not_removed,im not a fan of black directors their movies are all about blackness all the time always and nothing else its boring
movies,not_removed,i loved hollywood shuffle
movies,not_removed,actually thats what i found interesting about this list i myself dont really pay much attention to the race of the director andgrowing upi didnt pay any attention to who the director was i just went to the movies because i loved it but theres a certain way in which i knew even at the time that these films were not mainstream even in my urban neighborhood though i couldnt have told you at the time why they werent race plays tricks on our subtle perceptions i think
movies,not_removed,not even spike lee rmovies bogeyman black director has a totally black centric oeuvre with summer of sam and old boy summer of sam is a very good film too
movies,not_removed,film
movies,not_removed,finally a fools gold sequel
movies,not_removed,it was never about the money it was all about his christmas booty
movies,not_removed,let the mcconaissance continue
movies,not_removed,cant wait for the seinfeld photoshop saying gold jerry
movies,not_removed,was gonna say this
movies,not_removed,it stalled for a bit wouldnt you say
movies,not_removed,id argue it ended with the oscar win which also coincided with true detective interstellar onwards is a different chapter in his biography
movies,not_removed,there post era in his work will continue to produce quality i believe it
movies,not_removed,hopefully so dark it cant be seen at all
movies,not_removed,implying that darker is better shows a real misunderstanding of the source material
movies,not_removed,yeah but wed still have to watch your garbage fire of a movie sono thank you
movies,not_removed,ive already seen the darker version i closed my eyes during the whole movie so guess id say it was dark
movies,not_removed,kappa
movies,not_removed,okay but unless i can actually watch it somewhere that doesnt do me a whole lot of good does it
movies,not_removed,what he means is the films image levels were reduced by in post so now you can hardly see shit
movies,not_removed,heres what fox should do with in my opinion admit that the released film was a failure gather up all extant footage deleted and extended scenes and release it on a special bluray invite faneditors to have at it take whats there and make the best they can evaluate the resultant fanedits and reward to the best one rerelease the film on disc with both the theatrical and fan edits profit
movies,not_removed,inappropriate michael b jordan joke
movies,not_removed,wow such a cynic
movies,not_removed,thats so funny i forgot to laugh
movies,not_removed,i bet the whole unshown movie is just a closeup of jordans face
movies,not_removed,did you forget to laugh during the movie too cuz it was hilariously bad
movies,not_removed,false
movies,not_removed,ulrich muhe was one of the greatest actors of his generation and in many ways this was his swan song as his died just a year or so after its release its a magnificent film and he is astounding in it id like to rewatch it i remember being initially skeptical of the film beating pans labyrinth for best foreign language at the film and while i never quite swung around to definitely preferring it any doubt of it not being worthy was swept away
movies,not_removed,one of my favourite films of alltime just fantastic in every way
movies,not_removed,great movie the last line in the film is so great
movies,not_removed,i would like to have hope so but as you likely know by now this sub isnt the best when it comes to actual good movies that arent popular or trendy
movies,not_removed,im irish but i went to a german school my whole life and the teachers would sometimes show us films that were historically significant or just straight up blockbusters in germany i think one year we watched the lives of others about times great film
movies,not_removed,this is such a great movie its extremely touching and the ending was perfect
movies,not_removed,the lives of others beat pans labyrinth for best foreign picture at the oscars for the longest time i was pissed at this movieuntil i saw it edit i think i would vote for pans labyrinth if i could but the lives of others is definately worthy of the award
movies,not_removed,i saw this on saturday great film my mum whos german recommended it
movies,not_removed,this film is damn amazing so happy others are praising this film the entire stasi situation in east germany is so interestingbonkers if anyone else liked this film and the surveillance aspects check out the book stasiland by anna funder it is an amazing nonfiction account and series of interviews with people who lived during this period of time it is an excellent companion piece to this film
movies,not_removed,its one of the best film ive ever seen
movies,not_removed,the lives of others is one of those movies that i forget about but when i think about it im pretty sure its one of the best made films ive ever seen
movies,not_removed,this is a special movie that of the film watching world wont see simply because it isnt in english its a shame
movies,not_removed,i love it one my alltime favourites its just such a strong story covering so many themes and ideas
movies,not_removed,i truly believe that this is as close to perfect as a movie can get the characters the story everything was so wellwritten and the actors all did a wonderful job
movies,not_removed,its so weird to think that the only film the awesomely named director florian henckel von donnersmarck has done since this one is the tourist yes the joliedepp one
movies,not_removed,yeah i watched it and its awesome
movies,not_removed,love it
movies,not_removed,yes i saw it when it came out a few years ago and regularly quote it when people ask for your favourite last line of a movie s shall i gift wrap that for you no thanks its for me
movies,not_removed,ah great thanks for reminding me now im crying and also speaking of suicide in communist regimes i am in china now and learn more and more about how terrible the problem of suicide is here very terrible
movies,not_removed,love this movie it made me cry
movies,not_removed,its a great movie i thoroughly enjoyed watching
movies,not_removed,one of the best
movies,not_removed,it was a very good film i remember watching at the same time as die fälscher and due to that die fälscher stood out more to me but nonetheless das leben der anderen was and continues to be a fantastic film that i need to rewatch
movies,not_removed,if you like things set in cold war germany deutschland a tv series is worth tracking down its on in the uk not sure about the uselsewhere
movies,not_removed,oh yeah its an amazing movie and it really grows on you with every time you watch it it is crazy that it was florian henckel von donnersmarks first work as a director and simultaneously it was his masters thesis for his film studies and what a masters thesis it was
movies,not_removed,i love this movie so much and havent seen it in several years where can i watch it in the us
movies,not_removed,its already acclaimed as a masterpiece it certainly is one of my favourite movies ever
movies,not_removed,wouldnt you like to know
movies,not_removed,fantastic film
movies,not_removed,i mean it won best foreign film so id guess yeah probably so
movies,not_removed,dude its really popular even won an oscar
movies,not_removed,yes this is a great film
movies,not_removed,for anyone wanting a really concise article about the film theres a great writeup at which also goes into depth on the digital format the film is presented in and touches on the interesting time in history when the film was released when bluray was just being introduced
movies,not_removed,if you liked the lives of others you should definitely check out burning bush
movies,not_removed,i had to take an elective in my last year of university so i took post unification germany in film sounded interesting and i love film one of the movies we watched was lives of others it honestly blew me away i had to write a paper on it afterwards and ive never enjoyed writing a response as much as i did that one its such a tense compelling movie and truly a hidden gem
movies,not_removed,i actually wrote an essay on it a few weeks ago very interesting film
movies,not_removed,yes
movies,not_removed,havent watched it in years gonna have to go through the mountain of movies in my closet now to watch it again i do remember it being very good the thing where they took the seats out of chairs to collect scents for police dogs comes to mind specifically
movies,not_removed,a lovely film that does the period very well if you havent seen it yet gary oldmans tinker tailor soldier spy is of equivalent quality and covers a similar period also doing a walking tour of east berlin is really fascinating
movies,not_removed,i think its great but i remember rolling my eyes when the car accident happens towards the end like it was just out of nowhere and felt like lazy conclusion maybe i need to rewatch
movies,not_removed,this movie is pure amazingness everyone should be required to watch
movies,not_removed,of course other people have seen it its one of the highest rated films on imdb and netflix you didnt find some undiscovered cinematic jewel i swear to god the same movies get discussed over and over ad nauseam here yesterday someone made a big deal about seeing the good the bad and the ugly for first time he was probably only the millionth person to realize it was a good film
movies,not_removed,i love the deus ex machina where she gets hit by a truck it illustrates how even though the east german government has near complete control of its people there are somethings that cant be controlled
movies,not_removed,the best film youve ever seen whaaaaat this reminded me of an average stephen king movie in terms of quality
movies,not_removed,completely agree i hadnt seen him in any films prior to this and without a doubt his performance is one of the best ive ever seen absolutely phenomenal on every level its rare that such nuance and humanity can be expressed in a character youre not supposed to like and in the end actually do care for what a shame that he passed away so shortly after the film
movies,not_removed,i remember being initially skeptical of the film beating pans labyrinth for best foreign language at the film and while i never quite swung around to definitely preferring it any doubt of it not being worthy was swept away oh they were both made in the same year thats a bit sucky since they are both great films i definitely prefer the lives of others but pans labyrinth is another absolutely fantastic film
movies,not_removed,what was the last line nur für mich only for me right when hes buying the book
movies,not_removed,oh please the lives of others is one of the trendier options for foreign films here
movies,not_removed,yeah i think its unfortunate that they came out in the same year i saw pans labyrinth just a couple years after it came out and lives of others tonight i prefer the lives of others but they are both absolutely amazing films
movies,not_removed,damn man i saw a video delving into the subtext of pans labryth wildly interesting watch the video and tell me if you picked up on any of this
movies,not_removed,money and a vacation in italy i wouldve made that as well
movies,not_removed,its on in us and can be purchased on itunes google play etc
movies,not_removed,its not an obscurity competition and plenty of people avoid great films in other languages than english
movies,not_removed,well it wasnt a car accident it would have been lazy if she had just been randomly hit by a car but sieland committed suicide i agree that this is one of the only things that a film could have done slightly better since it was very sudden and a little random the exact way she commits suicide doesnt make a whole lot of sense given that she knew dreyman would be arrested before coming home in the first place but i didnt think much of it
movies,not_removed,well it wasnt exactly an uncontrolled accident she ran in front of the truck to commit suicide
movies,not_removed,god in the machine
movies,not_removed,i think he brought that humanity to every role ive seen from him im a big fan of his collaborations with michael haneke and think his portrayal as the tortured father of both bennys video and funny games go a long way in making those films work so well when hanekes white ribbon came out i as left wondering why on earth muhe wasnt in the film only to discover hed been dead for two years i was shocked
movies,not_removed,if i recall correctly its es list fuer mich its for me i could be wrong its been a few years since i saw it but didnt the seller ask if he wanted it gift wrapped
movies,not_removed,ill agree and disagree i think for the casual novice it isnt like say amelie or pans labyrinth but as soon as someone takes foreign films serious its up there in that next level
movies,not_removed,its a really popular film won awards i think is on netflix easily available hardly obscure and we are talking on a movies forum and if you avoid a film because it isnt in your language then thats just idiotic and if you looked up a lists of good foreign language films the lives of others will pop up on loads of them because its so easy to get hold of and is very accessible
movies,not_removed,im sorry if i came off as ignorant i did watch this a while ago and yes now i remember i do say though that is my only complaint i thought the acting was the greatest thing about it and i loved the politics of the movie as well
movies,not_removed,yeah youre right its more of something that government cant control thats why they make such a big deal about the suicide paper
movies,not_removed,anything unexpected in a movie is deus ex machine on rmovies
movies,not_removed,ill have to look into his other work white ribbon was a phenomenal movie as well the performances and cinematography were wonderful and that scene where the son gives the bird to his dad completely crushed me
movies,not_removed,yeah the seller asked if he wanted it wrapped and the hauptmann replied no its for me i didnt remember exactly how it was worded but i think that was right i thought of a few ways to interpret that what the symbolism was i mean but im not so sure
movies,not_removed,rmovies is the super mainstream movie discussion subreddit where people think lotr batman and marvel are good films this is an excellent post in that context if you dont like it there are plenty of more in depth and advanced movie subreddits
movies,not_removed,you arent sure the whole book was based on what he did to him it was dedicated to him he was hgw check out the
movies,not_removed,rmovies is for all movies you muppet lives of others has been popping up on this subreddit for years its nothing new at all in any way at all maybe op should have checked before a shitpost like that
movies,not_removed,i assumed the meaning was supposed to be more symbolic than just the insidejoke that the book was dedicated to him one of the major themes of the film of the hauptmanns moral development his coming to be emotionally mature and attached to other people i thought that there were ways of interpreting the last line of the film that might be references to that or other themes in the film
movies,not_removed,rmovies is the first port of call for people just getting into movies you muppet
movies,not_removed,ah i see hmm i never thought of it as having any other significance
movies,not_removed,no it isnt at all its for everyone my point still stands
movies,not_removed,lol good luck with your policing the default subreddits project
movies,not_removed,what a twat you are lol
movies,not_removed,strange
movies,not_removed,the sorcerer supreme
movies,not_removed,thrilling
movies,not_removed,science squid
movies,not_removed,ohhh shit they better not fuck this one up jordan peele watch that movie likes its your religion and be specific with details make the fanbase proud
movies,not_removed,it looks like hes on the studios wish list at the moment but if hes really familiar with the property and has great ideas for an adaptation then i say go for it im betting the studio is only looking at him because he told a great story on a budget
movies,not_removed,i hope that whoever does it follows the movie close to heart and doesnt do some weird hollywood bullshit adaptation thats all im really hoping for
movies,not_removed,the continuity between the xmen movies are just so complicated and screwed up i just gave up trying to understand it
movies,not_removed,i guarantee you that was just brian singer fucking up continuity and not giving a shit
movies,not_removed,its a lack of commmucation between two different directors the wolverine and dofp were filmed pretty close to another so i guess singer didnt know that mangold lopped off wolverines claws though its not shown in the movie singers explanation is that magneto could reconstitute the adamantium claws has a different relationship with magneto and perhaps magneto could forge them so there ya go
movies,not_removed,sure lets go with that
movies,not_removed,how was silver samuriabot able to cut thru adamantium anyway
movies,not_removed,the continuity is a mess and in particular the post credits scene in the wolverine makes things a lot worse as best i can figure out the time travel aspect of dofp can explain the claws we see wolverine with bone claws at the airport in the wolverine and then the next time we see him in dofp they are back to being coated in adamantium we can probably assume that the same interference in the past that undid scott and jeans deaths also prevented the wolverine from happening at least not exactly as depicted in the film seeing as wolverine was still suffering from grief over jeans death this makes a certain amount of sense he never lost the claws instead wolverine was captured by stryker in the and they attempted to weaponise him before he was set free by the mystique and the xmen in apocalypse what doesnt make sense is trask introducing prototype sentinels in the but xavier and magneto only going to wolverine for help in the my only guess is that mystiques abilities reemerged after she turned herself in and her dna was used to make the adaptive sentinels that way
movies,not_removed,the original trilogy was internally consistent origins wolverine changed one or two details the look of the alkali lake lab and wolverines dog tags but was still consistent with the previous movies plotwise first class was where things started contradicting each other and the changes snowballed through dofp and apocalypse
movies,not_removed,you know whats funny though the continuity was perfectly fine in xmen through the xmen movie that fucked up the continuity was xmen first class although singer was involved with that movie as well so i guess he deserves partial blame
movies,not_removed,i guess magneto managed to put metal claws on him again
movies,not_removed,though ive never actually seen the specific comic didnt magneto pull all the adamantium out of logan in an comic arc i always thought this was a major arc that would be shown one day in the movies
movies,not_removed,because his sword was heated adamantium
movies,not_removed,magneto controls wolverine at the airport checkpoint because yes he still has adamantium on his skeleton just not his claws he wasnt freezing his hands to stop him he was freezing his entire metal encased skeleton
movies,not_removed,but then again this stuff is easy as hell compared to the time travel shenanigans they pull off in the comics i still prefer the basic continuity they have over at the mcu though
movies,not_removed,yeah but i still try to think about how the timelines are supposed to be connected sometimes and it only hurts my brain lol
movies,not_removed,too busy with little kids to care
movies,not_removed,first class was fine it intended to be its own thing from the beginning and was going to just be a reboot days of future past is where they fucked it up because they decided they wanted to do both timelines and they somehow had to make them both work
movies,not_removed,yes then later apocalypse shows up pits logan against sabertooth logan wins and apoc removes the adamantine from sabertooth and puts it into logan knighting him death of the four horsemen
movies,not_removed,yes i think they pay homage to the scene in dofp with magneto putting the rebar metal in wolverine
movies,not_removed,doesnt mean itd cut thru like diamond cuts thru anything besides other diamonds
movies,not_removed,also all humans naturally have iron in our blood
movies,not_removed,i havent read the comics so i wouldnt know about that i did try to figure out what got changed in the big reset at the end of dofp its complicated youve pointed out the key difference between fox and marvel where fox do xmen movies one at a time with each building on the last marvel seem to have the overarching storylines for their cinematic universe planned out with each movie filling in the details
movies,not_removed,xmen first class is clearly a prequel the opening of that film is a shot for shot recreation of the opening in the original xmen film complete with the michael kamen score from xmen it also has a hugh jackman wolverine cameo and the film was marketed as a prequel to xmen bryan singer who helped produce and write the movie also called it a prequel so did vaughn although he said he didnt give a fuck about continuity
movies,not_removed,and in first one where he bends wolverines claws then says he was there to kidnap rogue not him
movies,not_removed,if its heated then yes it could
movies,not_removed,but not as much as that guy in x men
movies,not_removed,not that type of iron inside the blood is diamagnetic
movies,not_removed,heating wouldnt make a diff
movies,not_removed,good thing mystique helped her ex lover magneto on that
movies,not_removed,that wouldnt matter and really im joking magneto had that power in the comics but i know hes a bit weaker in the movies
movies,not_removed,yah it would dude
movies,not_removed,oh ur right hot metal always cuts thru the same metal
movies,not_removed,saw this
movies,not_removed,httpsalternativemovieposterscomstheamazingspiderman
movies,not_removed,kickpuncher kickpuncher the ultimate kickpunch kickpuncher punchkickers revenge cyber punches with the power of kicks
movies,not_removed,dont forget the spinoff elbowkneer son of kickpuncher
movies,not_removed,she definitely doesnt walk towards the woods with the baby shes playing peek a boo when it vanishes
movies,not_removed,i can honestly say i did not get that impression but i havent seen it since opening weekend
movies,not_removed,i think you need to know a bit about the puritans to really understand the film the puritans always thought females were more susceptible to the devil than males the film itself seemed more like an urban legend the puritans would most likely tell their children and family to keep them from straying from god i dont think there is anything inherently deep about the film what you see is what you get my opinion anyways i really enjoyed the film because it captured how frightened the puritans were of the new world you should read some the literature by puritan women of how the forest frightened them constantly and how unknown everything was sorry went on a tirade that completely disregarded the scenes you were talking about p i dont think thomasin knew about the witches in the woods i think her character was just there to serve the stereotype that women were more susceptible to the devil also everything was out of her control and considering her age choose the devil and have some semblance of a family or be orphaned in an alien world because your whole family is dead both her choices kind of sucked but yeah she also loses her soul such is life though
movies,not_removed,i must not have been paying close enough attention to that scene isnt she close to the woods when it happens
movies,not_removed,thanks for the input great information to know going into the film have you studied the puritans before
movies,not_removed,shes by their house how did you miss this scene lol have you actually seen the movie where did you come up with her walking to the woods with the baby to sacrifice it lol this scene is like in the first minutes
movies,not_removed,its literally the first scene and yes she is close to the woods playing peekaboo
movies,not_removed,yeah i spent a semester studying the literature from that time period it was really interesting to say the least
movies,not_removed,i never said she did it was a theory smartass
movies,not_removed,its not the first scene
movies,not_removed,right but she doesnt walk with the baby towards the woods which is what you said im just wondering how you saw a scene thats not in the movie lol
movies,not_removed,the film opens on thomisen removing her hands from her face and staying peekaboo
movies,not_removed,do you need to rewatch the scene the baby literally disappears by the edge of the woods she walked with the baby to the edge of the woods sits her down plays peekaboo disappears camera pans to the lining of the woods thomasin runs towards the edge of the woods is that clear now did you even watch the film edit jesus fuck you people are all too literal maybe you dont physically see her walking to the woods before playing peekaboo but how the fuck do you think she wound up there maybe she flew i didnt know you needed everything spelled out
movies,not_removed,uuhhh no it opens on thomasins face as her family is before the town council
movies,not_removed,she sits beside the house she is not at the edge of the woods we know this when the baby vanishes the camera tilts up and we see the woods far away tomisens perspective you should probably give the movie another watch if you werent paying that much attention at minute i have to disagree with you she has no idea about the witches and certainly doesnt sacrifice the baby willingly
movies,not_removed,well fuck me
movies,not_removed,the woods honestly isnt that far from the spot she stopped its okay everybody tries to figure out their owm theories its just something that i wanted elaborates on thanks for the input
movies,not_removed,no worries buddy this is a movie that is widely open to interpretation so go for it thats what makes cinema so great
movies,not_removed,definitely what scene from the film struck you the most
movies,not_removed,im a little biased friends with the editor so i loved the whole film my two favorite scenes would probably be the baby death and when mercy taunts tomisen for being a witch by the river clickety clackety
movies,not_removed,he is confusing good movies with profitable movies there are still a lot of bad movies being made but they are profitable
movies,not_removed,yes you can you cannot get away with making bad movies without huge stars in them
movies,not_removed,what like suicide squad
movies,not_removed,then whose been letting him get away with it
movies,not_removed,he should know since he hasnt been in a good movie for a long time
movies,not_removed,will smith announces his retirement
movies,not_removed,lessons will has learned from his sons acting career
movies,not_removed,for what its worth ill take wild wild west over suicide squad anytime
movies,not_removed,i think hes right to an extent i bet that if we didnt have rt or imdb that suicide squad would have performed better i think a movies rating and the spread of opinions through social media has an effect now albeit one that can mostly be mitigated by big actors or being part of a popular franchise
movies,not_removed,sure you can suicide squad is a mess and made a lot of money it depends really i think the author of this piece is not very astute either after earth is terrible because of jaden not because of will and i actually dont think wild wild west is awful its not an awesome movie but its an ok comedy more recently hollywood has become extremely lazy and prices to watch films are ridiculously high so obviously movie goers are going to be more critical movies used to be cheap entertainment but now you need to practically take out a loan for a night out
movies,not_removed,i think dc is disproving this theory
movies,not_removed,wild wild west is enjoyable for what it is honestly he has a lot of charisma and the setting steampunk stuff looks cool
movies,not_removed,big willie hasnt been to the movies lately
movies,not_removed,tell that to adam sandler
movies,not_removed,he says this literally weeks after getting away with making a bad movie
movies,not_removed,is he kidding his movies are the epitome of mediocre blockbusters most of the time
movies,not_removed,certainly is hard to get people to go to good movies though lots of reasons for that
movies,not_removed,i thought wild wild west was a fun movie
movies,not_removed,whatever makes you justify your terrible choices in scripts will look at leo then look at yourself
movies,not_removed,which is unfortunate for will as hes made a career out of starring in bad movies
movies,not_removed,so hes not making anymore movies
movies,not_removed,i understand the desire for selfimportance here but heres something to consider suicide squad did solid business its already at mil worldwide yes it likely could have done better had the movie been good but as it stands the movie is a success
movies,not_removed,says the guy who boycotted the oscars because he wasnt nominated for concussion
movies,not_removed,will smith is a solid actor anyone whos seen pursuit of happiness seven pounds and ali can attest even concussion featured a solid performance that being said his script picking choices have been less than solid as of late which is what he should be concerned about now i dont blame him for being in after earth any of us might see the value in trying to help our childrens career take off and be successful wasnt his fault it didnt work dudes got acting chops just needs to pick his roles better
movies,not_removed,birdemic disagrees
movies,not_removed,there are so many example to prove him wrong just ask michael bay
movies,not_removed,he better tell nick cage then that guy lives off bad movies
movies,not_removed,am i the only one that likes wild wild west
movies,not_removed,isnt that what hollywood has been doing for the last decade getting away with making bad movies by the power of marketing
movies,not_removed,i really want to hear adam sandlers take on this
movies,not_removed,no you can still make all the terrible jump scare horror movies you want and make multiple times the budget on the opening weekend
movies,not_removed,bad horror movies seem to be the exception right now
movies,not_removed,yes you can you can get away with bad movies as long as it is fun
movies,not_removed,he seems to have mastered the knack though
movies,not_removed,says the guy who only acts in bad movies any more
movies,not_removed,pretty sure he got away with it in suicide squad
movies,not_removed,the smith family has an ego problem
movies,not_removed,if movies were affordable wed just queue up and go but if youre going to charge premium prices we want a premium show so well read reviews before making a decision
movies,not_removed,so then how does he keep doing it
movies,not_removed,uh yes you can you keep doing it over and over
movies,not_removed,how is will smith the closest thing we have to hollywood royalty i know that he used to be the guaranteed summer box office revenue generator but i think that is fading beyond that and i like will smith though not many of his movies he doesnt strike me as the kind of movie star that people aspire to be streep hanks clooney fit that role better in present day hollywood i agree that instant wide distribution of information from the public has made everyone a vocal critic making it more difficult for bad entertainment to prosper due to ignorance though you still need to take in to account who it is that is sharing their opinion
movies,not_removed,bad movies are made all the time a majority of movies are terrible the system is whats wrong
movies,not_removed,said will smith making millions from shitty movies
movies,not_removed,not sure suicide squad was his fault he brought it in that movie i hated the movie but thought it was honestly one of his best performances
movies,not_removed,what viewers didnt change anything hell were the only reason why making movies is even a business
movies,not_removed,then explain almost every movie thats come out in the last few years
movies,not_removed,so where are the good movies will
movies,not_removed,says the star of suicide squad
movies,not_removed,hollywood weve tried everything except encourage good directors reward poignant writing and let the artists do their work without micromanagement from business minded execs why are we failing
movies,not_removed,will smith better
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,tell that to adam sandler
movies,not_removed,believe me ive been trying
movies,not_removed,how does he figure
movies,not_removed,and yet he still keeps getting roles in films
movies,not_removed,no they havent the masses still go see fucking garbage movies while no one goes to see actual good original content suicide squad and kubo and the two strings are perfect examples of this
movies,not_removed,what about after earth
movies,not_removed,he should have done id resurgence
movies,not_removed,but they made suicide squad and got away with it
movies,not_removed,when you make shit like after earth you kind of deserve it
movies,not_removed,i think a more accurate way of putting this would be filmmakers and studios now feel the audience response much more than they used to its harder to blame those snobby critics for low scores when the internet is full of direct audience feedback about how terrible the movie is on the day of release a poorly rated movie can still bring in money at the box office but the bad reviews are damaging to the careers of actors directors and other creatives associated with a movie optimistically you could say this would encourage hollywood to make better films but my concern is that it will only pressure them to make safe movies that dont take any risks and try to please everyone
movies,not_removed,tell that to my boy adam sandler
movies,not_removed,doesnt stop them from trying
movies,not_removed,says the one who was in ss
movies,not_removed,i really dont get it movies are not objectively good or bad the quality of good or bad is entirely subjective to the individual viewer sure a lot of people think transformers and its sequel sucked ass i liked them are the movies good or bad we can argue quality of writing acting whether or not cgi is tying cinema and how badly avatar will suck until we run out of oxygen but you cant change the fact that just because the majority dislikes a movie it does not mean the movie is objectively bad its almost as if smith has never watched a movie before
movies,not_removed,dear will smith no one watched wild wild west kids bought tickets for that film to sneak into blair witch
movies,not_removed,just a thought but shouldnt it mostly be the customer that makes the rules most times we want this not that so i wont spend my money if i dont get that
movies,not_removed,will smith needs to get back to making theme songs for his movies after earth ride tha hawk feat kendrick lamar and keb mo could have really helped that movie out
movies,not_removed,why does will smith hate wikiwikiwild wild west so much
movies,not_removed,tell that to adam sandler
movies,not_removed,i agree the system has changed i use to be able to watch a couple of trailers and get excited to go see it in the theaters but now i avoid trailers like the plague i watch the first official trailer and then avoid anything else like teasers i hardly go to the movie without someone i know going to see it first and giving me their opinion i also watch a couple youtubers who do movie reviews and then check out rotten tomatoes before going to see a movie in theatre it cost so much money to go see a movie now that i have to make sure that its really something that i want to see because i dont want to waste time or money i have one exception that i do and that is marvel movies i go see those in imax no matter what since ive been a fan since i could read my dads comic books at
movies,not_removed,michael bays rolling around on a pile of money laughing at this article
movies,not_removed,yep will the gig is up
movies,not_removed,will smith swore and the world suddenly seems like a much darker place than it was
movies,not_removed,this actually makes me very happy to read to know that there is a concious in hollywood that recognizes the greed over the quality if work they been giving us for the past crap decade and longeri hope this is the turning point where we see greats again
movies,not_removed,people are going to know really quickly and globally whether a product keeps its promises sadly marketers and trailer makers do not seem to have realised this yet either that or they just cant hear all the screaming through their mountains of cash theyre rolling in
movies,not_removed,adam sandler sends his rich regards
movies,not_removed,right theyve changed it by calling every movie a bad movie unless people are circle jerking about it then its a good movie
movies,not_removed,of course you can will the only difference is a minority jump online and qq its not the audience being more informed or changing the system through social media imo its that a lot of mainstream cinema itself has changed into a highly homogenized product based more on marketing and blowing a cgi load all over the screen than actual substance and people are both getting sick of it and far more skeptical of hype and marketing as a result maybe im alone here but online opinion and critique has zero influence on me seeing a film its a loose barometer at best if i want to see a film that interests me ill go see it regardless of what is said online or if critics give it a ill make my own mind up
movies,not_removed,good maybe he will retire from acting its not like he doesnt play the same character in all those movies
movies,not_removed,i um enjoy wild wild west
movies,not_removed,the usa has overall become a bit more critical of bad movies but i think a bad movie can still make a boat load of money from a china release a lot of international markets still love special effects and cgi festivities even if they arent particularly good movies
movies,not_removed,i dunno about all yall but i rarely ever see movies opening week even back before the web age id let friends and critics be guinea pigs and then id smash up their reviews into a collage and see what filters out because reviewerscriticsfriends do have biasesagendas also if i got burned once on a franchise or actor im very reluctant to pay to see anything else
movies,not_removed,after earth is one of only two movies i have turned off part way through because i just couldnt stand to watch any more of it it is literally one of the worst movies i have ever tried to watch so i will give will credit he certainly does know about making bad movies
movies,not_removed,but you can get away with rating good movies as bad looking at you reviewers attacking warcraft
movies,not_removed,will smith is not a good actor he only knows how to play will smith
movies,not_removed,weird seeing as suicide squad was a steaming pile
movies,not_removed,suicide squad was terrible just awful my god
movies,not_removed,so everything he has made post ali
movies,not_removed,what was the last good movie will was in
movies,not_removed,you say that but this stinker of a movie managed to make crazy money still and its probably large part due to his name
movies,not_removed,well he should know
movies,not_removed,everything changed after earth
movies,not_removed,yep just look at will s filmography since hancock all masterpieces
movies,not_removed,huh thats funny i couldve sworn will smith just starred in a turd named suicide squad huh
movies,not_removed,sure you can just has to be a marvel or dc movie
movies,not_removed,dripping with irony will smith has made exclusively shitty movies for years
movies,not_removed,what would he know about bad movies s
movies,not_removed,i dont think after earth gives you much of a leg to stand on here will
movies,not_removed,lol yeah thats why there hasnt been a decent movies released in years
movies,not_removed,i dont see will smith movies because he isnt really an actor will smith is will smith in every role hes ever been in
movies,not_removed,indeed paul blart exists
movies,not_removed,hes defining good in a businessmarketing sense it meets the needswants of the audience fun can make a movie as successful saleswise as high art can you just need to know who your target market is and what theyre looking for i can appreciate a movie like fast furious is a good movie from a business sense in that it really effectively delivers what a certain audience is looking for i just dont happen to be part of that target market
movies,not_removed,the thing about adam sandler movies is he is very open and honest with marketing to let you know what you are getting his only recent bomb pixels was the only movie whose ads tried to pretend like t his was a good move paul blart in its name lets you know this movie is stupid come if you want a stupid time fuck yea there will be fat jokes kevin james has a stupid mustache yea we know no reason for it we just didnt want you thinking this movie was anything other than stupid protect and serve wanted you to think a mall cop movie could be clever there is nothing clever about a mall cop nothing we accept that its just stupid you know all the jokes we are going to give you all of them kevin james will do some flips cause for a big guy he is surprisingly agile its cute
movies,not_removed,like suicide squadruns away
movies,not_removed,i meanyou can also get away with it if the movie is bad enough but entertaining if its just terrible thats different
movies,not_removed,after earth
movies,not_removed,tell that to
movies,not_removed,sort of movies like that still disappoint at box office see bvs which despite numbers was still a financial disappointment
movies,not_removed,ben hur pimped the sit out of morgan freeman who i bet is only in the movie for like minutes
movies,not_removed,what are we some kind of reddit commenting squad
movies,not_removed,i think suicide squad is feeling the effects of the mixed mostly negative reviews and mixed word of mouth sure the movie is still doing well enough but movies that are really well received usually stay on top longer the movie could probably have performed at the level of cap am civil war if it had been received better a better movie now it just did well in the first week and everything after is slow in general box office succes is more and more correlated with critic and user reviews for wide release movies so will smith isnt wrong here the younger generation is much more likely to read about a movie online beforehand to make an informed decision because they do so for many other products as well as the older generations stop going to the movies or die off this correlation gets stronger disney seems to have gotten the message first because theyre getting pretty good at combining financial succes with actually making decent movies disneys own movies marvel star wars pixar theyre doing really well financially and deserve the top spot imo other studios are still stuck in the idea that big stars some cgi and some focus group testing are enough but theyre being proven wrong several big studios are struggling and even desperate curious to see how the blockbuster segment develops in the coming years edit few small corrections
movies,not_removed,much as i disliked suicide squad its doing pretty well at the box office
movies,not_removed,which is probably what prompted that statement
movies,not_removed,sum kind of suicide squad
movies,not_removed,and after earth
movies,not_removed,eh it wasnt a bad movie at the very least it was entertaining even if the plot was tiring but the writers and editing definitely fucked it up will smith was easily the best part of the movie though
movies,not_removed,i was gonna say most recent movies have been pretty shit compared to movies in the past
movies,not_removed,ok movie is not a bad movie we live in the age of ultra hyperbole everything is either omg its so amazing im shakinggg or worst film in the last years what an utter turd
movies,not_removed,hes not really getting away with it iirc he was the biggestmost well paid actor in the world just before hancock hes far from it now back then id watch movies just for will smith now i dont really care
movies,not_removed,to be fair hes been the highlight of these bad films
movies,not_removed,then whose been letting him get away with it whos
movies,not_removed,i am choosing a dvd for tonight
movies,not_removed,after earth is the only example of a truly bad movie hes been in since wild wild west which while stupid had some fun charm suicide squad was not bad it was ok
movies,not_removed,well concussion had a pretty good performance from him but besides that yeah
movies,not_removed,focus was at the very least pretty decent
movies,not_removed,seven pounds is also amazing been a while though
movies,not_removed,to me will smith hasnt been in a good movie for centuries
movies,not_removed,he was so hot in hancock and i am legend werent even amazing movies and people loved him anyway i dont what he was thinking not doing a movie for years after that
movies,not_removed,jaden to take over as the smith actor will also be given host role in new cosmos series
movies,not_removed,hes really more suited for philosophy
movies,not_removed,watching that movie after listening to an evening with kevin smith is fucking funny i found myself super excited when the camera lingered on the cliff i was like ooh here it comes and boom giant spider also the racist backandforth quips was worth the rewatch and of course the bits of butt from hayek and ling
movies,not_removed,wild wild wess
movies,not_removed,im really not sure with this thread this years biggest movies flopped hard with the exception of one movie suicide squad everything else just flopped because of low scores hes absolutely right
movies,not_removed,exactly if suicide squad or bvs were good movies they would be breaking all sorts of recordsits not like the reviews are meh like the star wars prequels they are bottom of the barrel bad movies
movies,not_removed,i actually dont think wild wild west is awful im glad wild wild west exists just so we all got to enjoy the story kevin smith told about some producer wanting to shoehorn in a giant mechanical spider to a superman movie which eventually sank into preproduction hell only to have that same producer finally find a production that was fine with him shoving in a giant mechanical spider say what you want about the movie but that specific guy got to live his super weird dream just like we all hope to do
movies,not_removed,i cant imagine the dc universe can take much more critical flops people are happy to see characters like harley on screen for the first time but they are quickly turning against the dc continuum it will be just like the tv shows people might be invested at first but will get pissed at the low quality and start tuning out
movies,not_removed,after earth is terrible because of jaden not because of will wills pretty fucking terrible in after earth that weird quasibritish accent and flat affect didnt do that shitshow any favors
movies,not_removed,after earth is terrible because of m night shyamalan and jaden and imo will too and where are you going to the movies i see everything because i love movies and find them to be one of the cheapest forms of entertainment or even cheaper if you go on the right day or at the right time is too much i disagree just dont buy concession for your whole group if you dont want it to be expensive
movies,not_removed,hollywood has become extremely lazy i dont think it is laziness it is the bloat of middle management executive overreach over reliance on focus groups over thinking misplaced priorities and many other factors which are huge expenditures of time and money that have nothing to do with creating good art and have everything to do with creating a product the worst part of it all is how incredibly hard they work to churn out mediocre overworked garbage
movies,not_removed,how so their movies are horrible and theyre losing money with each one
movies,not_removed,wild wild west is freaking awesome i dont understand why people trash it so much its funny the characters are likeable and the setcostume design is interesting im not sure what everyone wanted out of that film but its a lot of fun no complaints here
movies,not_removed,if it works for you thats cool
movies,not_removed,the problem with that movie was that the director didnt have control of his actors they both were hired and neither wanted to be the funny one so they both played it pretty straight and it lost that comedic edge that would have made it much better the director said it himself in an interview
movies,not_removed,i havent seen that movie in a coons age
movies,not_removed,i thought wild wild west was a fun action movie yes it is dumb but it is still fun
movies,not_removed,its camp at its peak form its so earnest in its ridiculousness that its endeared itself to some people add to that i think kevin smiths story about john peters has increased the metahumour of the movie
movies,not_removed,now youre being generous most of his recent work has been utter shit hes like the anti tom cruise he only picks shit movies to star in
movies,not_removed,to be fair he was really good in persuit of happyness i robot concussion and focus and he played different type of characters
movies,not_removed,his best performance was when he widened his range in pursuit
movies,not_removed,and those roles are all he knows how to do
movies,not_removed,quite pathetic how agent jay is less mature in each sequel
movies,not_removed,yeah suicide squad only made million worldwide before it begins raining downvotes i didnt say suicide squad was good but i absolutely wouldnt say it underperformed if anything it overperformed
movies,not_removed,bombing
movies,not_removed,kubo was great gf and i saw a random trailer for it about months ago and were pretty hyped about it saw it opening weekend and both enjoyed it a lot everything about that movie was refreshing
movies,not_removed,this is already happening see the bazillion franchises trilogies sequels adaptations etc we get every week now its truly rare to see a movie that is an original
movies,not_removed,and then you get the anticirclejerk that calls every movie bad if the original circlejerk calls it good first because the only way people can think its good is if they have hype goggles on and nobodys being honest with themselves i honestly dont mind circlejerking about stuff you like or dislike but i feel like its given rise to this mindset of absolutely no one can have their own opinions you have to either hate or love everything with nothing in between and no matter what your opinion is its not actually your opinion its just whatever supports your agenda
movies,not_removed,the china box office certainly is influential especially compared to even years ago warcraft is a great example of a film that made huge money overseas and basically nothing in the us however the weak us box office might also prevent warcraft from getting a sequel
movies,not_removed,huh
movies,not_removed,i would disagree with that statement entirely i would say he has been giving the public exactly what it wants for the past years when he does take on a lesser sympathetic role the movie doesnt do well because people just dont want to see it much like robin williams in a drama
movies,not_removed,he does dramatic roles very well
movies,not_removed,oh hell no
movies,not_removed,can i just say that i think paul blart excels at hitting its target market is it a bad movie maybe its not an amazing or genre defining movie but it does exactly what it sets out to do
movies,not_removed,to this day i dont understand how it made enough money to warrant a sequel
movies,not_removed,if you actually watch the second paul blart mall cop film then youll realise that it has a lot of comic gold in it
movies,not_removed,always bet on blart
movies,not_removed,i purposely didnt mention any movies as good and bad are too subjective if listed movies i think are bad i would be attacked with pitchforks
movies,not_removed,the sharknado series is amazing dont you dare say anything bad about it
movies,not_removed,after earf
movies,not_removed,that was actually one of the few movies i can say was painful for me to watch i was only able to watch the whole thing out of sheer morbid curiosity
movies,not_removed,eh million budget and million box office it wasnt the greatest movie but i enjoyed it
movies,not_removed,it had good actors but no huge stars they are not always the same
movies,not_removed,who were the huge stars in
movies,not_removed,i never made a deal with
movies,not_removed,tbh i think a lot of ben hurs problem was marketing i didnt even know they were making it until i heard that it flopped
movies,not_removed,the only way to solve this crisis is to be superman four the quest for
movies,not_removed,wait say that again
movies,not_removed,hope youve got insurance
movies,not_removed,nowe da patsies
movies,not_removed,the movie could probably have performed at the level of cap am civil war if it had been received better thats kind of an obvious statement if it was a better movie more people would see it
movies,not_removed,mixed reviews might wanna take off those rose colored glasses nothing about its reviews were mixed it was completely trashed by critics
movies,not_removed,suicide squad is doing well enough in the box office but im really curious to see what effect it has on the future of the dceu within my group of friends it burned off the last goodwill we had and wont see anything that doesnt hit
movies,not_removed,mixed reviews and mixed word of mouth it was bad and it got bad reviews there was nothing mixed i felt vindicated because i had said it was going to be awful when the trailers kept making the front page and was downvoted to oblivion it looked like a turd but because the editing to bohemian rhapsody was so good everyone thought it was going to be great
movies,not_removed,if it had been received better if it was a better movie you mean
movies,not_removed,i dunno there were a few cringe worthy scenes in squad but overall i enjoyed the movie for what it was a fun mins of shit blowing up
movies,not_removed,people read about it online first because going to the movies is too expensive to gamble on whether or not its a good movie
movies,not_removed,thats the point his own movie is proof you can get away with making bad movies
movies,not_removed,thats the point
movies,not_removed,the first week it was bonkers and then took a pretty good dive that first week was hype and there was a lot of it imagine the movie was actually really good on top of the hype we are talking another million
movies,not_removed,i think it would be doing even better in the box office if it was better received
movies,not_removed,because it was the last big budget action movie of the summer
movies,not_removed,welcome to earf
movies,not_removed,after erf
movies,not_removed,well it was a straight up fresh prince movie after all
movies,not_removed,i know man also music made after sucks s
movies,not_removed,im actually dubious of a film if i find out will smith is in it whilst suicide squad was overall disappointing i feel like he made an excellent deadshot i have mixed feelings about this film i think he just needs to get parts that suit him or written around him enemy of the state is still one of my favourite films mainly for him
movies,not_removed,it makes me sad that we still dont have a real equivalent to will smith today even though the actual will smith is still around
movies,not_removed,after earth
movies,not_removed,looking at suicide squad i can certainly agree with that
movies,not_removed,in hollywood years is a lifetime
movies,not_removed,i thought they ruined a lot of the magic with the garbage b plot about will smiths dad
movies,not_removed,agreed also concussion
movies,not_removed,tell da trufff
movies,not_removed,it was okay every character always said what was going on it was weird
movies,not_removed,raising his kids
movies,not_removed,phil was great at osophy thus philosophy youre welcome
movies,not_removed,still waiting on john peters getting his polar bear fight because as im sure youre aware theyre the fiercest killers in the animal kingdom if you havent check out its really insightful and fucking hilarious at times the cutting back and forth from the artists telling their horrors stories of john peters are edited so well with peters trying to explain himself
movies,not_removed,they are far from bad movies extremely mediocre yes people extremely exaggerated the reviews so it just compounded
movies,not_removed,right online reviews dont dictate whether or not i like a movie either but they have an impact on people who are on the fence about deciding to watch something or not
movies,not_removed,link for it been in some of his podcasts as well
movies,not_removed,when that story was told on hdtgm i could not control myself with laughter it was true perfection and made me appreciate www a lot more
movies,not_removed,honest question if i hated man of steel because of the beginning and ending but actually liked not loved bvs what are my odds of enjoying suicide squad
movies,not_removed,judging by their box office i think they can take more terrible reception suicide squad is pretty different from bvs and mos it is meant to be humorous but still take the dark tone that theyve built into their universe it tries really hard to be a good movie but there are just way too many weird editing choices and cuts to make it a good film its not bad at all id go with mildly entertaining best marvel movie i can compare it to would be the incredible hulk just dont go in expecting a coherent and logical movie
movies,not_removed,i see everything because i love movies and find them to be one of the cheapest forms of entertainment is too much i disagree most consumers are used to paying less than then for a whole month of netflixspotifyxboxlive etc going to the movies for like hours just doesnt seem like good value for money anymore
movies,not_removed,terrible i think you mean great i like it but i think its somethin bad
movies,not_removed,theyre not losing money though suicide squad is doing great unless youre comparing to potential box office numbers if they were better
movies,not_removed,i liked it because i was when it came out its a great kids movie
movies,not_removed,not a huge fan of wild wild west but people are on the will smith hate train strangely its not even because they dont like him they just dont like jaden who happens to be a normal teenage kid
movies,not_removed,i havent seen wild wild west in a long time however i imagine its like batman robin or batman forever youll hear they are the worst films ever made but if you sit and watch them now they are actually fun campy and colourful movies
movies,not_removed,im sure the sequel will smooth out those concerns
movies,not_removed,should check it out might be in your wheel house
movies,not_removed,peters is that the actor that plays the villain
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,years ago it was the exact opposite
movies,not_removed,ah a bio pic that portrays the bad person as the hero just like hmm i am legend
movies,not_removed,its an amazing movie the amount of work that went into the movie is astounding
movies,not_removed,right exactly although i have a hard time relating to people who hate any movie at all or actively and passionately dislike it or anything predominately negative ive never watched a movie and really had that strong a negative feeling about it the strongest i remember having is thinking freddy got fingered was pretty bad before i realized it was supposed to be and the joke was on me well done people act personally offended by movies and i dont get that most movies are at least okay in terms of providing some kind of entertainment value or telling some kind of story most of the time people demonstrate pretty clearly in their complaints that they didnt even understand something about the movie or the movie as a whole or that they just didnt even make an attempt to give it a chance but thats enough ranting
movies,not_removed,they were merciless towards it
movies,not_removed,i agree for a long time he gave the public exactly what they wanted will smith but they no longer want will smith they want someone who can play other characters
movies,not_removed,psschufuh
movies,not_removed,i can get that i bought the heat and i like it its a terrible movie i shouldnt like it yet somehow i do
movies,not_removed,domestic gross million worldwide production budget million there is your reason also as the late great george carlin said think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that
movies,not_removed,its because kevin james is just an inherently likable person
movies,not_removed,its not that it made a fortune its just that comedieshorror filmsromcoms have absolutely tiny budgets compared to blockbuster action films so the studios are fine with pumping out mediocrebad crap in those genres because they will at least break even and they dont have exorbitant marketing budgets
movies,not_removed,its a family friendly movie so many viewers in this demo have a welp gotta take the kids to see something this week attitude that you dont really have to worry about positive press like you would for an adult movie kids movies that bomb tend to have alienatingweird premises mars needs moms look too challengingartsyweird kubo and the two strings or just have the bad timing to release at the same time as a more appealing kids movie a movie about a goofy mall cop is gonna do just fine
movies,not_removed,a lot to make so even with mediocre box office sales it turned a profit
movies,not_removed,its a story that takes place entirely in a mall starring kevin james an actor whos got name recognition but works cheap those movies cost nothing to make and are guaranteed to make their money back even with a lackluster showing at the box office
movies,not_removed,i dont understand how it made any money at all
movies,not_removed,observe and report mall of america on the other hand would be a great sequel
movies,not_removed,it was released at a time when studios dump their questionable movies in january it was the least objectionable movie at the time so people went and chose that one over all others it was the perfect storm
movies,not_removed,ah my mistake i only watched the first paul blart mall cop
movies,not_removed,loved here comes the boom
movies,not_removed,have you seen best acting ever
movies,not_removed,i never saw beyond the first one did it stay funny the first one took itself so seriously i was worried that beyond that one it might be too selfaware to really stay fun
movies,not_removed,sharknado can eat me sharktopus is the king
movies,not_removed,wow people downvoted a sharknado comment what is reddit coming to
movies,not_removed,you know when someone else does something so embarrassing you feel embarrassed for that person thats how i felt about after earth from the first fucking sentence of narration i shut it off minutes in the embarrassment was too overwhelming
movies,not_removed,yeah it was packed with up and comers but no mega stars that can carry a film on their own
movies,not_removed,who would you say are the current huge stars then
movies,not_removed,michael b jordans not a huge star but hes getting there
movies,not_removed,the biggest i can think of is probably kate mara but then i wouldnt call her an a lister or anything
movies,not_removed,so thats why they call it that
movies,not_removed,now that i read the joke in print i realize its supposed to be spelled for
movies,not_removed,ah he said it he said the thing
movies,not_removed,batsy batsy batsy
movies,not_removed,right but isnt that smiths point hollywood used to have more success with shit movies that were marketed well but thats waning now you need good for action movies as well as good marketing its not a simple formula anymore
movies,not_removed,so i guess the best movies are the ones that the most people have seen right
movies,not_removed,not really how many people saw spotlight or revenant as opposed to civil war
movies,not_removed,these are the kinds of brains being scraped off the floor who take time to remark on the mainstream film industry
movies,not_removed,rose colored glasses im not defending the movie i have no horse in the race either way mixed may be marginally too positive a choice of words but its not far off the response has not been universally negative from either critics or the public metacritic has the movie down as mixed or average reviews with and imdb is at rt is at though with a average so maybe the best wording would be mostly negative instead of mixed doesnt really affect the point i was making though
movies,not_removed,rose colored glasses reminded me of daredevil
movies,not_removed,for real
movies,not_removed,correct although in defense of op mixed reviews usually means a fair number of bad reviews
movies,not_removed,yeah but fans loved it and its making a sinful amount of money so its fair to say the film is an outlier similar to some of the earlier transformers films the last made a lot but were still scored low by fans
movies,not_removed,thats the thing im not entirely sure that dc realizes its going to need to start making good movies at some point yeah you can get away with oversellinghyping bad movies for a little bit especially when you are breaking out shit like batman v superman out of the gate but people will start burning out
movies,not_removed,within my group of friends it burned off the last goodwill we had and wont see anything that doesnt hit yikes
movies,not_removed,yeah man after batman v superman my friend group all felt burned we waited a week to see reviews for suicide squad and as it looked crap and so went to see star trek instead weve all agreed to wait minimum a week before seeing any dc film we are the target demographic for these films and have seen most of the marvel films asap if thats a trend then its devastating for the dceu
movies,not_removed,what effect did mos have on the dceu third biggest batman box office and biggest superman box office ever what effect did bvs have on the dceu biggest august box office in history despite a shitty movie face it theres no just world here bad movies make lots of money if the audience is happy the only barriers so far are the nolan barrier for batman films and the robert downey jr barrier for superhero films in general you need nolan to break a million or rdj to break million in superhero flicks
movies,not_removed,thats kind of a risky way to play this game isnt it i assume youre talking about rotten tomatoes for scoring thor the dark world has which could have easily been and that movie is horse shit fast and furious has and that movie is horse shit furious has and its complete horse shit avengers age of ultron has and its garbage captain america winter soldier has and its boring as fuck iron man has and its complete horse shit iron man has and its one of the worst marvel movies of the lot i dont get the obsession with rotten tomatoes as a measuring stick because it fucking sucks its subjective crap
movies,not_removed,the second week was the biggest second week for an august film the third week was the biggest third week keep in mind guardians is an august film the ridiculous opening for ss was followed by a huge second week that couldnt match the epic levels it wiped out box office records that wasnt a movie people lost interest in it was a movie that was ducking crazy successful opening weekend this is the difference between sums and ratios half a cupcake is a smaller sum than of a wedding cake youre stuck on ratios and avoiding any discussion of the actual sums to recap ss did million in days guardians did million in days both released in the first week of august sums versus ratios
movies,not_removed,i didnt like the movie either but it had strong legs indeeds despite every movie journalist being mad as shit towards it
movies,not_removed,imagine if starwars flew down the whitehouse and picked up the president what would we do we were lucky starwars was a good moviethe next one might not be
movies,not_removed,you think that would be the case that maybe if the movie was better it would be better recieved no way bro s
movies,not_removed,i think he long ago hit what i call the the al pacinodenzel washington state where theyve been in so much theyve been phoning in shit and now just come across as the same character in every single movie over the last years or so denzel does this lower lip overbite while sucking in his lower lip kind of thing now will smith does the head nod and dead eye stare shit and pacino does that bug eyed stare like hes trying to remember his lines
movies,not_removed,stop lying to these people enemy of the state was great by mainly because of gene fucking hackman
movies,not_removed,dont forget jack black i know i did till i rewatched it recently
movies,not_removed,ehhhhh i think hes good because hes got a great natural charisma that people gravitate towards but i wouldnt say hes an excellent deadshot per se hes good at being will smith and this time he did it in a costume
movies,not_removed,well from what ive read his deadshot will be in the batman solo film affleck is making
movies,not_removed,he did a nice job in concussion but i agree that most of his recent work has been weak
movies,not_removed,what suicide squad reminded me is that smith has more pure charisma than anyone else on the planet when he uses it hes just magnificent the problem is that hes been picking roles that dont capitalize on it
movies,not_removed,the rock
movies,not_removed,wild wild west wasnt for you
movies,not_removed,i get the impression after that point most of the films he was in spent too much of their budget on him being in them and not enough of their budget on anything else
movies,not_removed,you dont think he was good in that movie though this sounds liek the issue is with the director and the script not with will smith the only movie i genuinely think could be pinned on him was wild wild west because thats a script that should have been littered with red flags
movies,not_removed,well put it this way he wasnt what was wrong with that movie
movies,not_removed,b plot it was a minute thing at the end of the movie linking j and k it was great and expanded on their relationship in a deep and meaningful way
movies,not_removed,i mean yeah but the rest of the film is good too
movies,not_removed,best friend decided to marathon read the road and watch the movie immediately after what compels you people to make such poor life choices
movies,not_removed,man you need cheered up you can borrow my copies of old yeller and schindlers list
movies,not_removed,i mean in jaden was and willow was wouldnt you want to take off time before that
movies,not_removed,i would say nether movie is good enough to be called mediocre i would classify them as bad they have somethings going for them like some great action sequences good music but the story is woeful and i dont think there is enough good to push them into a mediocre category the shit is too thick for any of the good to rise to the top that seems to be what the reviews say too if you read them in full
movies,not_removed,they are very very very different you cant tell i loved bvs i dont like ss
movies,not_removed,why your feelings on mos
movies,not_removed,dude if you go in with minimal expectations you will find the movie entertaining its a fun and engaging movie about characters some more developed that others
movies,not_removed,i actually liked suicide squad not loved but liked i went in with zero expectations and while the movie definitely had some issues and editing problems it wasnt the glaring trainwreck i felt most people were making it out to be i think it was a solid enjoyable some great moments but nothing that will blow your mind
movies,not_removed,if you havent the urge to see it now id wait for streaming or dvd and make up you own mind
movies,not_removed,ss had jokes but i wouldnt describe the movie being humorous not the way gotg was and the jokes didnt hit so much either
movies,not_removed,its dollars unless youre working minimum wage and in serious debt thats really not a a lot of money thats like mcdonalds for two
movies,not_removed,fuck that shit i have a subscription for euros a month with tickets being euro i only need a month to break even
movies,not_removed,matinee for me now is the equivalent of about
movies,not_removed,bvs didnt do amazing box office wise compared to its budgetmarketing costs itll probably turn a massive profit from all the merchandisingnon box office sales suicide squad on the other hand is a sucess given that most of these characters are unknown to a general audience
movies,not_removed,i looked up each movie and youre right that being said batman v superman and suicide squad both sucked in my opinion so im just jaded
movies,not_removed,its still pretty fun now honestly
movies,not_removed,totally agree with you will smith still makes great movies though and his son is still a bit young to have developed all the skills that will was able to
movies,not_removed,agreed wild wild west was intentionally cheesy and it doesnt hide that one bit
movies,not_removed,the had a ton of fun movies like that surprised they dont take more chance on stuff like that these days
movies,not_removed,the producer hes the one who was adamant the climax of the movie feature a giant spider
movies,not_removed,im not sure what youre getting at here are you saying his character was the bad person in pursuit of happyness and i am legend
movies,not_removed,yeah i mean they gave their reasons whats the problem
movies,not_removed,production budget million so it was the sort of midbudget film that everyone agrees there need to be more of and it succeeded radically if it wasnt such a shit movie itd be an example of hollywood doing something right
movies,not_removed,wouldnt that be the median person
movies,not_removed,alsoand i cant believe im about to stick up for paul blart of all things but the first one wasnt that bad its still bad but strictly as a family film its reasonably enjoyable and you could do a lot worselike the sequel
movies,not_removed,think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that the average person is not stupid they are average
movies,not_removed,on a normal distribution curve
movies,not_removed,my new favorite quote thank you
movies,not_removed,i dont hate him but how can anyone possibly like him whats to like has he ever made a joke hes like hummus to me
movies,not_removed,the first paul blart mall cop is just a set up for the first minutes of the second paul blart mall cop trust me if you watch the second paul blart mall cop then youll absolutely love it
movies,not_removed,i was pissed when room came out obvious cash grab to confuse people that want to view the original masterpiece i mean theyre in a room like way too on the nose wiseau was clever enough with the meaning of room while this rip off had a room be the main plot
movies,not_removed,ive only seen about half of the fourth one it was not funny
movies,not_removed,i feel it stayed the same but just got way bigger
movies,not_removed,i thought miles teller did a decent job carrying whiplash but your point still stands i guess you could also debate if it was simmons that carried it but either way they were really the two biggest stars in the movie
movies,not_removed,definitely not four people whose biggest movies were sundance movies¹ one netflix show² and fucking tintin³ ¹ miles teller whiplash and michael b jordan fruitvale station ² kate mara house of cards ³ the guy whose name youd have to google fucking tintin
movies,not_removed,hes damn close miles teller is close too but hes been hovering around close for quite sometime whereas it seems jordan kinda shot up to where he is recently
movies,not_removed,its taking basketball fans a while to accept him as an actor
movies,not_removed,the only reason hes even remotely famous is because people get him confused with the basketball legend
movies,not_removed,i purposefully left out some punctuation so that the homonym would be more pronounced
movies,not_removed,hollywood used to have more success with shit movies that were marketed well bvs and suicide squad did big business due to marketing and by all accounts hardly function as coherent movies which shit movies back then did well i also think they might have done well because they didnt have the hundreds of millions of dollars poured into them like todays blockbusters are so the marketing is ultra aggressive nowadays to get as many people there for opening weekend with little focus on staying power or artistic merit
movies,not_removed,no being a good movie causes people to go to see it more people going to see a movie does not cause it to be good
movies,not_removed,if were already focused on talking about big dumb summer comic book movies then well yeah people prefer to see better movies all other things being equal
movies,not_removed,i could have clarified better in my original post but i already replied to someone else with a similar counterpoint if were already focused on talking about big dumb summer comic book movies then well yeah people prefer to see better movies all other things being equal
movies,not_removed,well they werent in theaters at the same time for one thing
movies,not_removed,i think the big danger ultimately isnt with suicide squad though i know for me i am not feeling too strongly about the dceu right now after superman and batman vs superman but i was still really excited about the suicide squad going in because just the nature of the movie feels so very different with the advertising and the marketing and just the overall feel presented for the movie it felt like this totally different thing and even with my somewhat lackluster impression of the other movies in the universe it really got me to buy in the problem is though that it didnt really feel all that different the issues it suffered were the same bad characters pacing and scripting with an overly ambitious world ending threat faceless villains and bad guy heroes who are kind of well they are these horrible people they murder for money they kill and eat people torture them are complete psychos but then after a minute introduction they are instantly thrown into a team and suddenly all these insane evil vindictive people are a close family willing to die for each other even after just minutes before completely betraying the team and escaping on their own what i am trying to say is the big danger isnt for suicide squad its for their new movies coming out they took a movie that has the most potential to be completely and absolutely different from their previous dc works and still managed to make it feel exactly the same and when that happens it really makes you doubt anything they ever make will be different it had the most potential to be something fresh and they squandered it which sheds a poor light on the chances of any of their more traditional movies breaking the mold they have established
movies,not_removed,even when you average the reviews together it doesnt break i think mostly negative is more genuine of a statement
movies,not_removed,it doesnt just apply to nostalgia it can also apply to someone who is kidding themselves
movies,not_removed,why not theres no time requirement for its use its not like its nostalgia goggles idiomatic an optimistic perception of something a positive opinion seeing something in a positive way often thinking of it as better than it actually is
movies,not_removed,suicide squads multiplier is horrible though thats what bad reviews get you bad multipliers and less money if it had the same reception as guardians of the galaxy and the same multiplier it would end its domestic run with million its not going to be getting anywhere close to that because its bad transformers eked out million if it was actually good like gotg it couldve hit over million more note used gotg because of the similar ss release date nothing to do with marvel v dc
movies,not_removed,why assume dc is intentionally cranking out bad movies theyre trying to get their own cinematic universe on its feet theres no logical way they would settle for movies that they themselves thought were bad or even mediocre the problem is that the dc heads think their movies are magnum opuses but obviously the audience thinks otherwise theres a disconnect between what dc thinks is a good superhero movie and what fans consider a good one david ayer was so confident suicide squad was going to be heralded and yet we all see how fans really reacted to it
movies,not_removed,wasnt star trek beyond considered the best one and didnt it do the worst so doesnt that in and of itself disprove the idea i honestly think it all comes down to marketing and well luck good movies flop all the time and bad movies rake in the cash its a perfect storm when both hit together and thats usually what the most successful franchises are built on even though even that is not always true most people arent looking at the new justice league movie and thinking i havent liked zack snyders films im not going to see it most people even those that see a lot of movies have no idea who the creatives are behind it its more of a whats playing this weekend that looks mildly interesting mentality your general audience isnt that concerned with what came before
movies,not_removed,thats your opinion though i think a lot of people would disagree with you on most of the movies you just referenced
movies,not_removed,all those opinions expressed as facts
movies,not_removed,obviously its not meant as a hard rule if it hits it wont be immediately dismissed and if its and the consensus is its not good but at least its better than suicide squad well probably still skip it ive wasted and hours on two movies i truly didnt like hoping the reviews were wrong
movies,not_removed,yeah i dont really get why people on this subreddit are so deadset on making it seem like every dc film is an absolute failure in every sense if people dont like the movies thats fine and totally understandable but making up facts about how much the movie cost to make or how well its doing in the box office is just ridiculous
movies,not_removed,the third week was the biggest third week that doesnt seem to be true actually from what i can tell ss made mil its third weekend for the whole week while guardians made mil and for the week week its below guardians again to recap ss did million in days guardians did million in days both released in the first week of august just looking at domestic box office ss had million to guardianss mil after days thats better but not that much better and with ss dropping faster the gap will close probably not all the way sure but some if ss got better reviews and better word of mouth that likely wouldnt be the case those ratios youre dismissing mean the two cakes will be pretty equal after all that wasnt a movie people lost interest in it was a movie that was ducking crazy successful opening weekend why cant both be true after an amazing first weekend people are losing interest quicker than with other movies
movies,not_removed,to be fair guardians had pretty much no hype aside from a trailer that made people go huh catchy musicthat guy from parks and rec got buff it was like an obscure franchise that people began to discover and talk about it was a surprise hit that nobody expected to do so well with ss they hyped the movie like hell reworked trailers to spin an entirely different movie and had star power of robie leto smith portraying comic book characters more wellknown to the population than a single gotg member so its like yeah of course box office numbers would be higher they did everything in their power to make those numbers high as opposed to simply just releasing a movie into the wild like marvel did
movies,not_removed,i am not arguing that it didnt do well financially i am arguing that it could have done much much better simply by being a better film i was probably off on my dive comment though i forgot to look before i posted
movies,not_removed,yeah i saw it and didnt hate it i thought it was pretty rough but not the complete shitshow some critics said it was
movies,not_removed,jimmy youre off your meds again
movies,not_removed,al pacino now is basically just a crazy old fart who does whatever the fuck he wants for the most part i think he dabbles in small theater productions these days in between doing mostly shit movies to pay the bills
movies,not_removed,denzel does this lower lip overbite while sucking in his lower lip kind of thing now omg lol so accurate im sitting here laughing at work from this
movies,not_removed,jon voight was pretty good too reprising his role as devious obviously corrupt man in place of power
movies,not_removed,watch the conversation in case you havent seen it
movies,not_removed,tell the trufh
movies,not_removed,gene hackman is a cunt
movies,not_removed,not deadshot deathstroke
movies,not_removed,while hes not the mainstream movie success that smith is i feel is a pretty good comparison
movies,not_removed,yeah like after earth he was the stoic military commander a role where he cant shine at all not once did he use the charisma in that movie and it showed
movies,not_removed,i genuinely enjoy www
movies,not_removed,that movie moves into that spectrum of so bad its good imo
movies,not_removed,genetically speaking it was his fault
movies,not_removed,well there were many things wrong about that movie he was too but just not the wrongest thing
movies,not_removed,he was though because it was basically his project he contacted m knight with the story concept and asked him to make a movie about it staring his son his son sucks but that aside why would you do this if i were him the last thing i would think is i want to jump start my sons career i know m knight shyamalan cause of all his hits like sixth sense and worst part is a little searching and youll find out m knight stole the plot of the sixth sense from an episode of are you afraid of the dark dude never had any writing talent
movies,not_removed,i dont know he did have that incredibly stupid accent
movies,not_removed,why young kids suck and are basically all the same when they start getting older and are capable of thoughts and understanding is when you want to start really guiding their development
movies,not_removed,suicide squad was edited to hell it hardly resembled a movie more like halfbaked a hour music video seriously i cant imagine that was the movie anyone set out to make
movies,not_removed,batman vs superman took an additional min after lex literally said batman is over there go get him to actually show the fight that movie dragged on so awfully i cant believe they wanted to add more min of boring bullshit
movies,not_removed,over the top end of world action does nothing for me it completely loses any dramatic tension and i dont care about the outcome i need some personal threat to feel invested like families on the ferries in the dark knight or kids being hunted in jurassic park otherwise it just feels like disaster porn and special effects dont wow me for that any more
movies,not_removed,i went in with extremely low expectations ended up hating it worst dceu movie by far imo
movies,not_removed,engaging it is not
movies,not_removed,and here you are raising his expectations p
movies,not_removed,a hundred percent this it feels like people approached it expecting a masterpiece it was nonwowwing fun movie will smith was tremendous they got the characters right enough to not upset my nerdrage
movies,not_removed,savage
movies,not_removed,compared toman of steel and bvs it was definitely more humor than theyve had before whether it was good depends on the viewer i thought it was ok but nothing like marvel style humor
movies,not_removed,yeah i know but im saying compared to whole month of entertainment you can get with that money from netflix or spotify hours at the cinema doesnt seem like such a great deal anymore
movies,not_removed,yea bvs had a lot bigger ceiling it failed to reach due to the quality it could have had easily been a smash hit disappointing
movies,not_removed,didnt do amazing is currently on top
movies,not_removed,think it has to do with a spiders natural ability to control the population of insects and pests potentially a fitting choice for the situation
movies,not_removed,in pursuit of happiness he spent all of their life savings without consultation and then accepted an unpaid job while they had rent a kid to support nowhere in there did he really act in the kids best interest in i am legend the monsters are the victims the film was poorly directededited to make it look like will was the victim
movies,not_removed,they lied misrepresented etc just like game journalists arent trust worthy and over represent or exaggerate the film journalists did the same
movies,not_removed,average can mean anything
movies,not_removed,median is an average
movies,not_removed,median is one kind of measure of average youre assuming that when ucysperling said average they meant mean average its a fair assumption but they still could have mean median average too
movies,not_removed,iq falls on a bell curve so meanaverage and median are the same
movies,not_removed,youre going to be a great redditor
movies,not_removed,if you want to maintain credibility dont go around saying you dont like hummas
movies,not_removed,his standup is ok if a bit generic king of queens was a good show though mostly due to his supporting cast i didnt say he was super funny or anything but its easy and fairly pleasant to spend a block of time watching him fumble about on screen he lacks the manic genius edge that made fellow hollywood fat guys farley belushi and candy timeless stars but he also seems to lack their demons which is why hes still around and theyre not add in the fact that his work is almost always family friendly and you have a guy seemingly grown in a lab for the sole purpose of making money for production companies hes like the human equivalent of pizza hut not many will tell you its their favorite pizza but you also wont find a lot of people turning their nose up at a slice
movies,not_removed,best drinking movie
movies,not_removed,there is a difference between say sharknado a film that tries to be bad for fun and wild wild west which is bad because it truly failed on every level
movies,not_removed,interesting i might have to look further into those thanks
movies,not_removed,he did an excellent job in whiplash as did simmons and it definitely has gotten him more attention but i dont think hes considered a huge star in the way that bradley cooper or chris evans whos names alone will put people in seats ill be interested to see what war dogs and bleed for this does for his career though
movies,not_removed,that does the opposite of answering my question
movies,not_removed,yes thats why transformers movies perform better than marvel movies
movies,not_removed,not what i was referring to nor what the original commenter was referring to
movies,not_removed,i agree suicide squad is the biggest problem for the dceu theyve had so far i thought man of steel was bad but quite a few people thought it was alright all in all it was just a pretty rocky start it wasnt the worst thing and i didnt see it as too bad of a sign batman v superman was actually bad but it was obvious to everyone who saw it that that was down to the studio wanting too much of it it was at once a batman returning movie a man of steel sequel a batman fighting superman movie and a justice league leadin it was clearly bad because it was constantly trying to juggle four different movies and stay coherent thats a pretty big task for anyone and a movie without that baggage could work so theres still hope for the next one suicide squad was just bad it didnt need to continue a story it didnt need to do several different things it just needed to be a good movie all on its own and it failed at that thats definitely going to do more harm than the other movies theyve put out so far
movies,not_removed,overly ambitious world ending threat this is starting to be a problem right off of the getgo every single dceu film is looking to be a doomsday scenario and audiences also stop caring man of steel kryptonian genocide of earth batman v superman fucking doomsday literally suicide squad magical armageddon compare that to marvel phase iron man jeff bridgess envy of tony stark in a cave incredible hulk save nyc from abomination smashing it iron man stop what amounts to a murder attemptbig terror attack thor pure character growthfamily conflict save a small town cap first avenger save nyc from getting nuked avengers at last the world is in danger phase iron man stop superhuman terrorists thor dark world stop bad guys from rewriting the universe at that point winter soldier guardians and ultron were all globalscale dangers then in antman its to save a little girl in the end it feels like dc just wanted to pump out a bunch of avengersscale hits thats not how any of this works not even in comics but thats not surprising even in dc comics in particular theyve been maniacally obsessed with grandscale globalgalacticuniverseshattering events for ages no one gives a fuck anymore in marvel when they do it its still rare enough that we all say oh shit its on now many of the marvel stories being done are far far smaller in scale its more like the dc tv shows you could do a legitimate six month six issue story about captain america traveling to the heartland to do something like find and save a kid who happens to be the greatgrandchild of red skull or something dc would have the kid be like some cosmic bomb or something
movies,not_removed,its on track to make more than guardians of the galaxy were getting kind of inane when a movie with zero alist heroes is the most profitable august release in the history of cinema and people are twiddling their thumbs over wouldacouldashoulda
movies,not_removed,gotg domestic foreign worldwide days ss domestic foreign days what source are you getting domestic for gotg
movies,not_removed,i get the impression dc execs think theyre better suited to making films than the filmmakers they hire the directors are glorified babysitters at this point i also get the impression that to them marketing is everything gotta get the people into the cinema and everything that follows including the fucking movie is secondary
movies,not_removed,i never said or even implied they are intentionally making bad movies im positive they are trying to make good movies they just havent been successful much and its going to start biting their wallet eventually
movies,not_removed,i agree with you about star trek as its marketing was poor however that isnt the main focus of my argument i was simply saying that young people who generally drive interest for these superhero films are beginning to view these films as a toxic brand i think its pretty widely agreed that the negative reviews for suicide squad kicked the legs out of the large initial box office from the good marketing further to this as you were saying most people have no clues about creatives however the general audience can recognise that these superhero films they watch are decreasing in quality if i remember rightly there was some evidence that revenue from the new captain america film was negatively impacted by how crap bvs was the point im poorly attempting to make is that repeated bad films can depending on the knowledge if the cinemagoer negatively impact a brand film series and genre
movies,not_removed,it appears around at least of people would disagree with him on one film and up to as many as would disagree with another obviously id have to survey hundreds of people for better accuracy but it sure does feel like the percentages line up with audience opinion
movies,not_removed,thats without china though which guardians had its pretty crazy ss is doing so well without china because thats become a make or break part of the movie market these days
movies,not_removed,hey we need someone to play a creepy old burea jon voight
movies,not_removed,come on guys we all know jack black was the star that made that film shine
movies,not_removed,i love how he basically plays the same character in both movies such drastically different movies but similar subject
movies,not_removed,viola davis played that role in this one along with joel kinnaman
movies,not_removed,why
movies,not_removed,deadshot too affleck wants to do a villain siege basically
movies,not_removed,burn him
movies,not_removed,ive yet to figure out what donald glover is all about i enjoyed community on nbc then there was all kinds of shifting and drama which i never fully understood too bad as it once was a very clever and quirky show that often tapped in to new and interesting themes while still loping along with classic sitcom memes ive sampled a little of what glover has done since leaving that show but little of it stood out to me as exceptional so an apt comparison
movies,not_removed,half his fault
movies,not_removed,unbreakable signs and the village are all decently written whether you appreciate the execution or not after earths core story is awful so much about it is nonnonsensical contrived and uninspiring it crafted merely for action set pieces and poorly paced emotional filler
movies,not_removed,dude never had any writing talent so that episode of alone in the dark also contained all dialogue characters and themes of the sixth sense including the penultimate scene that never fails to make me bawl my eyes out i need to check it out then what a ridiculous statement hes written three arguably five good to great films which is more than most filmmakers
movies,not_removed,i havent seen the ultimate cut but i did see one extended scene that seemed necessary luthor talking to an alien and getting caught i cant believe that was cut but superman talking to ghostdad was left in
movies,not_removed,zod wanted to terrform the earth to recreate his home planet and bring his people back from the brink of extinction while i get that end of the world scenarios have been done to death you cant really have superman deal with some trivial issue because hes too powerful he could easily handle small scenarios like the ferry problem xray the boats from afar to see which has the bomb and quickly swoop in and remove the bomb before it explodes with superman you kind of have to do bigger issues because thats when he is challenged i understand why you dont prefer that kind of conflict though weve seen it done many times over
movies,not_removed,i feel like everything you said applies to bvs tenfold more than it does man of steel
movies,not_removed,you might like suicide squad the stakes are big but they keep the story focused on the squad
movies,not_removed,i see reviews panning suicide squad as a trainwreck the fantastic four film that was a trainwreck suicide squad is just averageabove average perhaps with an extended version to restore some scenes change the flow it could be really good i dont think it quite deserves the hate its getting
movies,not_removed,i think it was humours in ways it wasnt intended to be
movies,not_removed,not everyone has the internet capacity to stream movies
movies,not_removed,compared to its budgetmarketing costs ignore the important part
movies,not_removed,unfortunately no its not nearly as thought out as that its because spiders are the fiercest killers in the insect kingdom much like polar bears are the fiercest killers in the animal kingdom it comes from kevin smiths story from the failed superman film from the midnineties its an hilarious watch and if that intrigues you at all theres a documentary on the whole project called the death of superman lives what happened
movies,not_removed,i can almost buy your argument for pursuit how in the hell is will smith not the victimhero in i am legend the people that turned into the monsters are victims yes the monsters they became are not will smith is literally trying to save the human species and does while the monsters are fighting for the exact opposite there is no way you can paint will smith as the bad person in i am legend
movies,not_removed,what did they lie or misrepresent the film critics i follow seemed to give perfectly reasonable explanations of why they didnt like those films
movies,not_removed,average is assumed to be arithmetic mean unless a different measure of center is specified
movies,not_removed,well i was quoting george carlin so the truly pedantic can argue with his rotting corpse
movies,not_removed,a backhanded compliment if there ever was one
movies,not_removed,i see what you are getting at i dont find him pleasant but i dont want to punch him in the face like sandler for some reason i still think pizza hut is a bit generous hes frozen pizza he fills a gap but is without any nutrition or substance the whole time you are eating it you wish you were eating something else they play king of queens at like in the uk ive only ever seen it properly when i was in an airport lounge and my whole body was sleep deprived nauseous and numb i could have watched that or tellytubbies and had the same reaction
movies,not_removed,i found out about it when made a game about it too bad we cant view flash on mobile phones
movies,not_removed,damn i guess he was in the wire wasnt he i dont really remember his character but i did watch it a long time ago i also thought he was nick cannon when i saw his picture
movies,not_removed,an exception does not make a rule
movies,not_removed,i would say a lot of the examples you listed still fit into the general complaint about save the world endings even though it might be slightly scaled back to save the city or stop terroriststerror attack in most cases the threat is still often too great here id love to see more personal endings in the movies going forward with the endoftheworld scenarios being saved for the avengers movies
movies,not_removed,you realize youre literally in a thread about wouldacouldashoulda and how reviews affect box office gross right has nothing to do with whether or not a film is successful regardless of critical reception
movies,not_removed,im not reread my comment
movies,not_removed,hes saying that were suicide squad to have had the reviews and word of mouth that guardians got it might be able to get close to instead its box office is entirely frontloaded and it may yet struggle to reach
movies,not_removed,and thats the power of doing good movies can you imagine if they tried to do a dcuniverse movie without much advertising based on the wbdc branding alone
movies,not_removed,jamie kennedy was tha bomb in enemy of the state yo
movies,not_removed,jamie kennedy was the lynchpin of the whole film
movies,not_removed,i watched enemy of the state the other day and noticed when they showed a photo of young gene hackman it was of him in the conversation thought that was a nice little touch
movies,not_removed,in the movie he is but i think he is supposed to be idk he is actually pretty cunty in crimson tide too but super cool in the replacements
movies,not_removed,like arkham originsknight sounds like a great idea
movies,not_removed,yeah i tend to dismiss everything beyond season season was an abomination then i felt like seasons were like a frankensteins monster of a tv show reanimated just to appease the fans not bad but nothing special i think given some time he could find some great success in films but i think the comparison is very apt because hes a crossover success made his name on a tv series has done some good standup work and is a decently big name rapper i feel similarly in that i really like some of what hes done but not all of it i have high hopes and im rooting for the guy i think hes a genuine talent that has his best years ahead of him
movies,not_removed,so that episode of alone in the dark also contained all dialogue characters and themes of the sixth sense including the penultimate scene that never fails to make me bawl my eyes out no it doesnt youre right it was probably actually better than anything penned by shyamalan
movies,not_removed,lol
movies,not_removed,were you the script writer or should i for some reason take your word on that spiders maintain a specific set of the bio food web they are not killers in a traditional sense they maintain eco system balance except for humans we destroy the balance apparently
movies,not_removed,they exaggerated them to oblivion and back instead of doing a normal point or so away for their issues they expanded that to what they would normally do while barely even critiquing the other movies they would rate highly and giving minor point reductions for that theyve always been highly unreliable when it comes to games in any case they also lied as many of their issues werent existent as i said game journalism hasnt been trusted for a while and film journalism isnt any different
movies,not_removed,right but the pedantic person would be wrong assuming average is mean only
movies,not_removed,and when they go to his office its basically the same faraday cage setup and a very similar abandoned warehouse as in the conversation but with computers
movies,not_removed,i recently saw a promo for an upcoming show on cable fx starring him he was a down on his luck character trying to climb back through managing an up and coming rapper despite my disinterest in the subject matter it looked like an interesting project
movies,not_removed,would you rather ms iwhipmyhairbackandforth starred instead
movies,not_removed,which is why no one has hears of it but yeah its probably better than the academy award nominated movie okay hipster
movies,not_removed,yes clearly my word is gospel im just extrapolating from whats told in that video i linked and doco i referred to the producer of the film john peters was adamant that the superman movies third act feature a giant spider because theyre the fiercest killers in the insect kingdom so it doesnt seem like much of a stretch to say that that was his reasoning for including it in wild wild west
movies,not_removed,i dont follow video game journalism as much anymore but i find the statement that film criticism is like that to be quite ridiculous film criticism has being better than it has ever being before can you provide actual examples
movies,not_removed,lol yeah holy shit i googled him and totally remember him now but yeah he looks way different obviously
movies,not_removed,atlanta that does sound like an interesting project ill have to check it out when it premieres i can get into just about any subject matter if its done well
movies,not_removed,its called a joke friend
movies,not_removed,im sorry but i have yet to see a film critic rate anything in a non arbitrarily inflated form just like game journalists and most youtube personalities do the best example as always is to compare the mean aggregate of user reviews to their metacritic review this works best a week or so after release so theres a large enough sample size
movies,not_removed,that would be before earth
movies,not_removed,i can give you some film critics that i think are excellent are what they do but if your looking at something like metacritic i fear were each looking for something completely different
movies,not_removed,parkoooooouuurrrrrr
movies,not_removed,parkour dancing nice
movies,not_removed,that was fun to watch is that the guy from seven brides for seven brothers
movies,not_removed,hes probably on the cheapest medical plan available i dont imagine that this particular future is a welfare state and considering they just dug him out of a hole he probably doesnt have the best health plan
movies,not_removed,how does he make it down them forest trails in that hospital spec wheelchair using only his little human arms and the thin wheels he was sent to pandora by a corporation that is operating in an environment that is free from ada and osha regulations which is pretty much what how all mining companies operating in third world countries operate now the guys that made the decision to have himreplace his brother didnt consider that issue when in pandora is not expected too he wasnt supposed to leave the compound where they kept the rest of the support personnel biggest plot hole in the movie to me you like so many on this sub have no idea what a plot hole is aside of giovani ribiisi being anything but a medic why giovanni is running a mining operation he would be either some type of engineer an accountant or the company owners son
movies,not_removed,they didnt have it in their budget so much was spent on tech and maintaining that that they only had scraps for a chair it probably could receive email or something but would need a plug in touch screen to access
movies,not_removed,on the earth of avatar poor people do not get the latest technology it made believable to me that earth was not a paradise but a miserable place
movies,not_removed,they shot some scenes of him on earth before he was hired on to replace his brother he was a wounded veteran and didnt have the wealth or access to the medical tech that could fix his paralysis i think they also promise him in the final movie at some point that theyll fix his legs if succeeds in his mission which is meant to be his big sacrifice helping the jungle smurf cats dooms him to never walk on his own feet again
movies,not_removed,my point is that even in the distant future where we are mining remote alien worlds where we have the tech to create dnamatched remote controlled organisms where we experience our consciousness through that other physical body wheel chair tech hasnt advanced at all regardless of how poor he was i think that part of the story is bs
movies,not_removed,we live in a future with robotic mechanical legs but kids in third world countries slide around on cardboard boxes technology spreads neither evenly nor rapidly through space something firstworlders are perpetually unaware of when the singularity happens of the world wont notice technology doesnt spread evenly and most of the world doesnt even have electricity
movies,not_removed,i think it is more for people who correct aspect ratio doesnt matter they look at the film and wonder why there are black bars on their tv i have family that when they first got an hd tv had sd television stretched to fit the screen and thought that the hd picture looked amazing unfortunately that is probably the majority of customers so they stretch to apease the masses although have seen hbo keep aspect ratio on some movies the ocean movies and the revenant come to mind
movies,not_removed,i like oar as well but what exactly is in the rest of the frame in rushmore that made it unbearable to watch
movies,not_removed,well hes not exactly portrayed as a lady killer hes fashionable in context i suppose but to me it doesnt seem like his looks are a factor at all
movies,not_removed,he isnt that good looking tbh
movies,not_removed,i think the general audience would have had a hard time to sympathize him as a species we simply dont care much about unattractive people
movies,not_removed,yeah i guess youre right it would have been cool to see someone like philip s hoffman play theodore but yeah it would have made it a completely different movie and that may not had been necessarily a good thing
movies,not_removed,was that a standard issue lapd sword
movies,not_removed,wow that looks impressive not going to lie its always nice to see a twist on certain concepts
movies,not_removed,this actually looks like something i want to see
movies,not_removed,alt universe i am legend
movies,not_removed,i was saying that the most disappointing aspect of suicide squad was how much i was rooting for it to be good for will smith i only buy ray ban sunglasses and big willie style is one of my favorite cds ever but goddamn has he made some boring fucking movies in the second half of his career this looks promising and netflix has been pretty on point the last couple years
movies,not_removed,this looks really interesting wow
movies,not_removed,damn at first i thought this was going to be a serious drama with social commentary but then bam sword and monsters
movies,not_removed,i liked the only in to only on netflix thing
movies,not_removed,welcome to middle urf
movies,not_removed,somebody played a lot of shadowrun in their roleplaying years
movies,not_removed,and its written by max landis too
movies,not_removed,will smith is doing directtodvd now
movies,not_removed,this needs to do well if only to convince netflix to pick up the dresden files
movies,not_removed,will smith with a sword im down
movies,not_removed,daywalker
movies,not_removed,no you can only get that if youre swat
movies,not_removed,yeah its a weird mix of stuff in the trailer but i am interested
movies,not_removed,i cannot explain that emotion when i saw the sword because i had the exact same thought going in
movies,not_removed,hey thanks for pointing that out i didnt even bother doing research when i saw the december premiere because i wanna save some hype for when it is actually coming out
movies,not_removed,yeah but this time with elves and orcs
movies,not_removed,swords warcraft and topless women hopefully
movies,not_removed,they sure dont make visual comedy like this anymore
movies,not_removed,when i was a kid i thought nicks speech about losing his mother growing up at macys was real like a real tragic story i didnt realize until i saw it again at like how ludacris the story actually is kilmer just sold it so well
movies,not_removed,yes honestly some of the best camp ever
movies,not_removed,my favourite comedy film full of ironic jokes and clichés its amazing even now especially in comparison to new fartcomedy era
movies,not_removed,love this movie you dropped your phoney dog poo what phoney dog poo
movies,not_removed,do you know a little german
movies,not_removed,souvenirs novelties party tricks
movies,not_removed,punchline ruined in the thumbnail
movies,not_removed,my favorite httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdxgykxaufbk
movies,not_removed,one of the funniest visual gags to me is when val looks outside the window of the train and he sees a man running full speed trying to catch a tree also when kilmer is singing in front of the audience and he tries to put his head in the oven and kill himself baby ill even be nice to yo mama
movies,not_removed,look up the british tv series a touch of cloth
movies,not_removed,if they did i have a feeling we wouldnt cherish them as much comedy gets stale quickly and this shit is corny as fuck but it works i love it
movies,not_removed,these visual gag comedies are like the prog rock of movies cerebral elaborate they had their own time when we could all enjoy them and now they are gone besides there is no way the millennial audiences would keep their interests in these sort of comedies where paying attention to detail and knowing some pop and history references are required
movies,not_removed,ludacris
movies,not_removed,mein camp
movies,not_removed,your hog balls sir
movies,not_removed,what movie is this
movies,not_removed,absolute gold
movies,not_removed,for the lazy
movies,not_removed,well it doesnt have to be just perspective jokes there are so many opportunities and ways to make visual gags
movies,not_removed,ok dad
movies,not_removed,where paying attention to detail is required it is the reason why the great comedy was canceled to quote a studio executive on why it was canceled because people would have to pay attention to get the jokes but at least we got good movies out of it
movies,not_removed,the story was told in a rap so very ludacris
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,top secret stars val kilmer
movies,not_removed,this might be a joke but for anyone confused there is actually a separate show called a touch of cloth this video is just a sketch from mitchell and webb look a fantastic sketch series
movies,not_removed,this is not at all what i was referring to httpsenwikipediaorgwikiatouchofcloth
movies,not_removed,obligatory drop of the
movies,not_removed,its true though mainstream hollywood movies are aimed at audiences aged it has always been the case for the past years or so that demographic happens to be millennials and that particular generation follows certain trends of social media short attention span and immediate gratification it just is
movies,not_removed,i knew i spelled that wrong autocorrect didnt kick in
movies,not_removed,you sort of forgot there are movie audiences outside the us of a but youre welcome
movies,not_removed,dub or sub
movies,not_removed,just watched it today was not disappointed the pacing of the film feels rushed but at the same time it doesnt feel uncomfortable to watch since it seems to flow well with the urgency of the situation that the viewer was immediately thrown into at the start of the film theres actually a pretty large focus on the human cast and its clearly made to be a social commentary on the current state of affairs mostly that of japans but its still relatable on a universal level to a certain extent human nature and the inefficiency of the administration its albeit comical at times but depressing since its horrifyingly accurate but at the same time it maintains a healthy stance of critique against the government and the american government by acknowledging the necessity of certain procedures and the reality of the world as well as the strength of individuals that are willing to undertake the burden of being marked in history for their decisions and the strength of humanity when they are truly united against a common foe it caters to nerds and geeks of all stripes as well ranging from the hard science fiction attempt at explaining the existence of godzilla and its physiology to intensely detailed protocols of the military or rather the jsdf and its equipment on the other hand it could get pretty corny at times and its easy to misunderstand the purpose of the film if you choose to shut it down without watching it further with an open mind it certainly deserves a solid imo
movies,not_removed,that theater list isnt final the only new york theater is yonkers it says from that one site
movies,not_removed,sweet only mins away will definitely be checking this out
movies,not_removed,yea boi
movies,not_removed,i saw this opening night in japan i strongly recommend seeing in theaters if you can the monster rampage scenes have real spectacle and corniness and bad fx are nowhere to be found its an awesome theatergoing experience i think most americans wont care too much for the plot if you watch this on a small tv you might not be too entertained but i think you will have a totally different experience if you see it in theaters
movies,not_removed,this is going to be a rather strange movie for us audiences its really nothing like any of the previous movies except maybe the first it may be a lot of things a social commentary on the handling of fukushima a political satire on the effectiveness of bureaucracyetc but if you are going there expecting more than about min in pieces of godzilla action you are most likely going to be disappointed it was not my cup of tea and i own every godzilla movie
movies,not_removed,the nearest theater is hours away jesus christ
movies,not_removed,the closest to portland is fucking kennewick jesus
movies,not_removed,no showings in ohio fuck
movies,not_removed,i wonder how many people will struggle to understand if this is a sequel to godzilla or not
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,neat
movies,not_removed,i hope my local theater gets this we got godzilla and it was glorious for me and my friends i do wish to repeat this experience a second time
movies,not_removed,i really just want someone to put all the godzilla scenes on youtube and save me the money
movies,not_removed,how the hell are there no showings in ny proper no yonkers doesnt count
movies,not_removed,in
movies,not_removed,eh im not super hyped yet we dont even know what theaters will be showing it
movies,not_removed,better be an indianapolis showing
movies,not_removed,nice i am waiting for this movie
movies,not_removed,anyone know if uk will be as lucky
movies,not_removed,anything for canada
movies,not_removed,cant wait
movies,not_removed,cool
movies,not_removed,the entire movie is a groundlevel view of this kaijū you see only his shins
movies,not_removed,omg gorjilla supa kawaaiiii dessuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
movies,not_removed,gouhado
movies,not_removed,shit godzilla
movies,not_removed,subtitled
movies,not_removed,asking the important questions here please be subbed
movies,not_removed,¿por qué no los dos
movies,not_removed,hopefully both i love dubs but dont mind subs at all even if the tone is off it doesnt bother me at all something about hearing about my natural language in a film makes me enjoy it more however subs are fine by me ive seen people say dubs shouldnt even be provided because they degrade the product i think the option makes it more accessible to those who are inclined to turn away from subtitled movies however subs are much easier to produce i assume and should always be available
movies,not_removed,sounds like an anno film looking forward to it
movies,not_removed,living in singapore so saw it last week and i enjoyed it i agree with everything here although i had a huge issue with the acting ability of whoever played the female americans character it just seemed awkward and forced and for someone who was supposed to be fluent in english and not in japanese it came across as the opposite where the english was difficult to understand at points and the japanese was pretty fluid it took me out of the movie at times plus her awkward overthetop actingposing towards the camera
movies,not_removed,on behalf of missouri i just wanted to let you know that i hate you
movies,not_removed,we gonna lit this bitch up
movies,not_removed,so its more serious than the millennial series
movies,not_removed,are you saying there is only minutes of godzilla ill probably watch it regardless but i would hope they would be minutes of godzilla in it especially considering i love the new design
movies,not_removed,pretty sure anybody familiar with the series will know to not expect too much screentime from the big g people complain about the lack of godzilla in the movie but thats pretty damn par for the course
movies,not_removed,so its like almost every godzilla movie ever then padding with characters we dont care about destruction shots and godzilla
movies,not_removed,akuma
movies,not_removed,good
movies,not_removed,the only way to see it
movies,not_removed,deleted
movies,not_removed,definitely more serious tone than anything made before they were going for a what if godzilla was a real threat similar to any other disaster feel but its a godzilla youve never seen before as well the godzilla scenes are the best made ive ever seen and this is the deadliest godzilla version ever its a good movie i just wanted people to know there is going to be a lot of scenes of people in meetings talking about what to do and less of them actually doing something
movies,not_removed,i cant really say for sure the actual screen time just my feeling watching it part of the problem of every godzilla movie is what to do with the time when godzilla is not onscreen they didnt want any of the showa or millenial side stories involving aliens or psychics just what could be scientifically possible in the real world so lots of people talking about what to do vs the usual human side story that may be as fantastic as godzilla itself
movies,not_removed,its worse because its all about bureaucratic red tape and watching how a huge government and politicians really make decisions on a large scale does anyone really want to see a movie about that yes it tries to focus on a few characters but watching how they interact within a huge government and committee meetings is a large part of this movie godzilla itself was a strange take he starts as this goofy creature with very odd eyes then evolves or times before its really godzillalike it was kind of ok and its not like the other movies where they try and obscure him with shadows smoke so you never get a good look at him oh not only does he shoot antiaircraft lasers out of his back but also out of his tail
movies,not_removed,shinkuuuuui
movies,not_removed,i mean there have been sub movies out in theaters in the past few years plus its a few nights special event i could totally see it being subbed since this movie is in theaters for the hardcore kaiju fans
movies,not_removed,what the fuck is your problem the two versions can coexist calm your tits
movies,not_removed,you dont get out to see many foreign films do you as a geeky godzilla kid i grew up with dubs and find them awful now i dont understand your logic in thinking those who had to suffer through them in the past would prefer them to subtitles today
movies,not_removed,the fact that funimation of all companies is releasing this tells me theyre not exactly expecting blockbuster numbers here its not like the other stuff theyve put in theaters like evangelion which was dubbed were particularly widespread or even popular i know for a fact im not going to see it if its dubbed liveaction dubs are just not enjoyable for me
movies,not_removed,no sorry
movies,not_removed,i would prefer subtitles but with dubs its more of an entertaining pop culture thing i grew up in the with lazy dubs on a lot of japanese movies and that became part of the entertainment factor to it either would be fine with me i think id take it more seriously with subtitles but dubs will be fine
movies,not_removed,so youre saying its a lot of people sitting around and talking as giant monsters horrifically smash things yeah sounds like hideaki anno
movies,not_removed,oh shit a godzilla movie to rival gojira i need to see this
movies,not_removed,seeing that last in a youtube video was what convinced me to wait until i have the benefit of a fast forward button while watching this i had a lot of problems with the american godzilla movie but none of them concerned the big g himself
movies,not_removed,annosan please feed the fans we want to read your movies
movies,not_removed,deleted
movies,not_removed,yeah animated films can have good dubs but live action i just cant see it happening i remember an old dubbed film playing on tv when i was a kid and it was so weird there this disconnect
movies,not_removed,deleted
movies,not_removed,are you familiar with how most other godzilla films are structured
movies,not_removed,ha
movies,not_removed,the nice flys
movies,not_removed,i think its cute
movies,not_removed,usually when someone cracks a joke this bad they have the decency to show themselves out
movies,not_removed,idk why i laughed
movies,not_removed,i laughed as well but not before groaning first good stuff

movies,not_removed,rodney dangerfield in natural born killers a guy known for being a lovable self defacing fart joke style humor guy takes a role as a sexually abusive father kelsey grammer as beast he pulled it off perfectly but it really is a departure from frasier vince vaughn as norman bates what idiot would attempt to top one of the most iconic performance as a pyscho ever filmed wtf were you thinking vince john wayne as ghengis khan come the fuck on john wayne was an icon when he took this part and he was so miscast
movies,not_removed,vince vaughn wasnt the only one deluded in that movie the whole thing was a terrible idea i had completely forgotten about grammer as beast he did seem to fit the characters personality but yeah still an odd choice
movies,not_removed,silence la la land arrival rogue one voyage of time billy lynn century women and rules dont apply are the ones i want to see most
movies,not_removed,should silence actually get released itll be at the top of my to see list but hey what do i know im a bear i suck the heads off fish
movies,not_removed,i am most interested in rouge moeana and arrival myself
movies,not_removed,paul thomas anderson and tom hardy
movies,not_removed,nick cage and quentin tarantino
movies,not_removed,vincent donofrio with david lynch
movies,not_removed,martin scorsese and ryan gosling
movies,not_removed,id love to guillermo deal toro work with christopher walken i think that given drl toros affinity for older actors hed really get something special out of him when hes really just been given the same roles the last several years
movies,not_removed,now that hes having his mcconaissance i want to see matthew mcconaughey work with david fincher could be really awesome also i love domhnall gleesons awkward british humour and i think hed be great to see in an edgar wright movie
movies,not_removed,paul thomas anderson directing michael fassbender or if the rumours about his new project with daniel day lewis are true then i would love him to cast joaquin phoenix as the other lead seeing day lewis and phoenix act opposite one another under andersons direction would be perfection
movies,not_removed,classic hand drawn animation as a medium it still gives a feeling cgi can never replicate just like or a year but give me something drawn please
movies,not_removed,miniatures when i look at the city scape in blade runner i start wondering it looks so real another in my opinion criminally overlooked example is the ship crashing into the pier in the lost world never actually wondered how they did this until i saw the miniatures in the special features it looks amazingly real combine this with todays computer technology to clean it up add some more details and stuff
movies,not_removed,mediumsized movies nowadays everything is either a huge blockbuster or an indie hit and if its not one of those two its usually a bust but back in the and there was a whole lot of wiggle room for a movie that didnt cost a lot to make a modest profit a lot of smaller thrillers and comedies from this era could never be made today because of the risk theres no middle ground anymore you have to be a smash hit or youre a disaster what the fuck could you even release a movie like primal fear today edit a lot of people have provided great examples that medium sized movies still exist upvote them because theyre absolutely right perhaps it only feels like there are less of them because there are more attempts at large scale movies like uafunfact pointed out in addition usiredcalot started a pretty interesting discussion about topic discussion basically all of the comments are better than the shit i spewed out give it a read
movies,not_removed,tastefully done full penetration scenes like in lethal weapon
movies,not_removed,growing up in a south east asian country in the and painted movie posters were everywhere the colours were so beautiful but occassionally they got it wrong it was so hideous there was a studio near my high school where i sometimes would visit and watch the artists work to create the vision then one day they were not there anymore i have always wondered where and what became of these artists when their job became obsolete
movies,not_removed,not editing with shitty digital intermediates thats barely better than most peoples tvs cinemas boasting that they have screens is especially annoying selling upscaled movies as or uhd isnt great either they made a big deal out of shooting the force awakens on film and then pissed all that beautiful detail away by transferring it to a digital intermediate
movies,not_removed,id like to see trailers made up of original footage instead of a montage
movies,not_removed,good old school epics not every film should be so long but i would love to have a hour long movie every once in a while
movies,not_removed,intermission theres nothing wrong with wanting a break in the middle of a movie to go refill snacks or use the bathroom
movies,not_removed,big budget films for adults outside of movies starring leo if you want more than million for your film you pretty much have to either have a ridiculously stacked cast or you have to make genre films that will appeal to kids i suppose tv has made up some of this slack with shows like game of thrones and vikings and such but i dont think its enough
movies,not_removed,not making sequels
movies,not_removed,breather time in movies build up to action that is slow to start long shots of a certain subject editing doesnt really do it anymore
movies,not_removed,comedies like airplane or naked gun
movies,not_removed,humour in comedies
movies,not_removed,practical effects
movies,not_removed,the return of auteur theory in big budget andor blockbuster films
movies,not_removed,slower movies that take their time to establish shots characters and mood the opening title sequence and initial tracking sequence in alien for instance is one of the creepiest loneliest sequences ever filmed it puts you in the mood to feel isolated and terrified before theres even one line of dialogue then the opening dialogue does nothing to push the story forward it exists only to establish who these people are and what motivates them movies dont take the time to establish themselves like that anymore or at least not the ones that ive seen even some of the best movies ive seen in recent years are relatively quick paced in comparison
movies,not_removed,practical effects i miss movie magic
movies,not_removed,using film instead of digital theres still a few underdogs like jj abrams and tarantino who use film instead of digital but largely the world has moved on from film imo film looks far better and iirc it has much higher quality than digital since it isnt limited by resolution
movies,not_removed,practical effects dont get me wrong i love cgi but the whole lets just fix it in post culture has been a detriment to films
movies,not_removed,original screenplays
movies,not_removed,films under hours opening credits with the title in front of the movie shooting and editing on high resolution film rather than digital doing as much incamera practical effects work as possible utilizing models miniatures pyrotechnics wirework animatronics makeup etc verisimilitude rather than postmodern cynicism and irony to when an audience over in an outlandish story etc
movies,not_removed,practical effects wellmade animatronics etc cgi
movies,not_removed,dvds coming with an insert with chapters labeled it stopped some time in the early and i quite miss it
movies,not_removed,using squibs to simulate gunshot effects action movies pretty much never use them nowadays and just use cg which looks really fake yeah people arent actually getting shot in movies but with squibs it looks somewhat realistic and not computer generated
movies,not_removed,movie palaces instead of theater chains
movies,not_removed,good writing of original ideas
movies,not_removed,a comedy thats a comedy and not some feel good were all special bullshit
movies,not_removed,keeping films under hours would be lovely just once in a while you know
movies,not_removed,screenwriting
movies,not_removed,oc
movies,not_removed,i may have gotten this post way wrong but in a more literal sense i would love to see a bit of the formal wear come back nowadays most people that work in the film industry belowtheline wear clothing thats as comfortable and practical as possible not that wearing hiking boots and band tshirts is bad but ive worked with an ad or two that wear a full suit every friday in honor of the men and women who wore business attire every day even while working on set back in the golden age theres something classy about making movies while wearing a tie
movies,not_removed,i kinda miss the erotic thrillerfemme fatalescorned woman from hell movies like basic instinct fatal attraction disclosure etc
movies,not_removed,it would be nice if decent wages made a comeback
movies,not_removed,intermissions on longer or more adult films screenings of movies none of this post converted stuff some of us can tell the difference which means subconsciously we all can native contains a lot more depth information post converted works the same way a pop up story book does way less advertising before the film i pad top dollar to see trailers are fine proper matting for letterboxed films especially in this age of crappy digital projectors huge projected black bars look like shit and it feels like im just watching a dvd at home cinema chains that care about the experience you can tell the big chains are trending towards allowing casual cellphone use in theatres fuck this
movies,not_removed,fight scenes in which the camera isnt jerking around and dont cut every frames id like that
movies,not_removed,i member when directors took out their viewfinder
movies,not_removed,casting actors based on talent and not for diversities sake
movies,not_removed,animatronics
movies,not_removed,nudity in r rated movies my local theater shows classics i watched the shining and enter the dragon for the first time in decades and was pleasantly surprised at the nudity modern movies have no problem with blood and guts but when it comes to bush or a titty they get shy
movies,not_removed,fight scenes that are choreographed and not just a bunch of shaky cam
movies,not_removed,sped up film silly i know but it always cracked me up back in the day
movies,not_removed,full penetration they dont show enough of it
movies,not_removed,studio contracts for directors producers etc like in the
movies,not_removed,i completely agree the princess and the frog was refreshing if you look at the animation then i recently rewatched aristocats after a long time and the animation is so so beautiful it really would be nice if disney would kinda go back to the roots look at hayao miyazakis work its incredible
movies,not_removed,why didnt you all go see winnie the pooh in then thats on you that movie was incredible
movies,not_removed,just like or a year its funny to ask for just or a year back in disneys heyday when it made hits like the lion king it was the only animation studio to make animated movies that got a wide theatrical release in the usa and there would only be animated feature to see per year total to be technically accurate there were sometimes other lowerbudget animated films you could see in a more limited release or at film festivals and of course there were some foreign films you could see if you looked for them and disney itself dabbled in releasing stopmotion films made by other studios but in terms of the big animated features most people actually saw the one film from disney would be it it was nothing like recent years with bigbudget animated features getting broad releases every few weeks
movies,not_removed,as a huge anime fan it pains me to see how much bigbudget western animation is cgi now
movies,not_removed,as an adult male i paid to see winnie the pooh in theatres that beautiful animation and attributed humor did a great job of making me not care that there was like kids under in the theatre all of them crying all of them being loud fuckers
movies,not_removed,disneys been really knocking it out of the park lately with its cgi films and of course pixars worst movies are still great but the thing with computer vs hand drawn animation the first toy story looks really dated now years later hunchback of notre dame does not pixars first crop of movies are still really great but its physically getting harder for me to watch them because theyre starting to look pretty bad and its worse for other studios who already started out looking not great when they were new who knows maybe in another to years those movies will be pretty much unwatchable while all the handdrawn movies from the still look great
movies,not_removed,lotr used miniatures perfectly orthanc barad dur great eye etc
movies,not_removed,batman begins used miniatures for the train crash
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,problem is ticket prices lack of disposable income lack of free time if you can go see a movie per month then medium successful movies have a place but when movie tickets with snacks cost and there are a million other entertainment choices competing for your time its harder to justify that also dont forget that home theater equipment has gotten significantly better and cheaper in the last decade you can now get a very respectable tv for under throw in another for a receiver and a basic set of speakers w subwoofer and a bluray player all the wires are color coded so even an idiot can set it up and many receivers now have auto calibration to adjust the levels and delays and whatnot drop the tv to and you can probably do the whole thing under the result is for a very reasonable price you have a theater in your home that in many ways rivals the experience of going to a cinema you can hang out with your friends and talk if you want eat good quality take out food and have some beers or wine or whatever movie starts when you want and you can pause it if you have to go to the bathroom etc in contrast the theater has overpriced tickets overpriced food thats often not very good a seat thats less comfortable than my nice recliner the movie starts on their schedule not mine and theres always someone kicking the seat or doing some other annoying nonsense now granted the theater has a much bigger screen and better sound but is that better screen and sound worth plus inconvenience for one movie increasingly the answer is no for me at least i still go to a theater for films that release in imax imax is worth paying for imho normal screens not so much
movies,not_removed,primal fear is fantastic i only watched it for the first time a few months ago i would also add that there are way too many blockbusters now it all goes back to what you mentioned studios want every movie to make a billion dollars which is even more difficult because of the sheer quantity of movies that are being pushed into theaters frankly its exhausting to watch all these movies that feature the world being saved or cities being destroyed
movies,not_removed,these movies still exist lol think of literally all the academy award nominated films of the past few years and this year birdman spotlight steve jobs arrival etc
movies,not_removed,these movies are still being made are you going to see them though
movies,not_removed,arrival was hacksaw ridge was girl on the train was the accountant was even sully is just a bit more at all of these movies came out this fall on a medium size budget and made a profit you were saying
movies,not_removed,i completely disagree its not as black and white as youre making it out to be i could list plenty of middleground movies that have been released this year they dont all have to be good or future classics everybody wants some kubo and the two strings midnight special the nice guys nocturnal animals sausage party hell or high water and triple werent made on shoe string budgets nor are they big budget hits all those films where released this year
movies,not_removed,those movies go direct to vimeo
movies,not_removed,honestly i think lethal weapon was better at least it didnt have a creepy old dwarf guy fucking in it
movies,not_removed,i presume that it was a kathleen kennedy decision to not quadruple the vfx budget on tfa by doing them in since vfx shots made up the majority of the film and less than half of north american screens are and im sure that percentage is lower for other territories plus the highest spec is and you wouldnt want to pass up the opportunity to remaster and make another pile of cash in a few years i will say the claim that the di was done in it was only the vfx that were upresd from makes me roll my eyes pretty hard
movies,not_removed,did you see it in imax
movies,not_removed,ffs watch the force awakens carefully and you will see that mastering in just wouldnt have been worth the extra cost between the and the vintage anamorphic lenses they used the footage they shot can only just resolve its mastering would have been total overkill what is with people on reddit thinking film is about resolution film has a look and an on set workflow that is entirely seperate to resolution thats why tfa was shot on film
movies,not_removed,fuck i want to see film make a huge comeback
movies,not_removed,most films are shooting alexa and its only really a camera
movies,not_removed,id like to see trailers not spoil the entire plot
movies,not_removed,such as
movies,not_removed,the first force awakens trailer basically did this im convinced several shots where shot specifically for the trailer especially that kylo ren shot hes not acting wounded and the shot is clearly designed around the reveal of the lightsaber in a way that wouldnt make sense at that moment in the context of the film
movies,not_removed,zootopia did this
movies,not_removed,i had no idea this used to be the case working on a script now and if it ever gets as far as that ive written standalone scenes that convey who the characters are and what the cinematic universe they exist in is like thought i was doing something no one had done before either way the point is to entice the audience into wanting to see the movie without giving any of it away
movies,not_removed,i feel that epics have made a comeback somewhat since the or at least directorswriters and production companies are making films very similar to the epics of yore movies like the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford there will be blood and more recently the revenant certainly feel like they invoke a certain big scope feeling that the epics before them had
movies,not_removed,yeah an experience like apocalypse now redux
movies,not_removed,tv miniseries have kinda become this
movies,not_removed,we have that in iceland it actually sucks
movies,not_removed,agree to an extent hour movies definitely need consideration for intermissions anything under hours no thanks it just interrupts the flow
movies,not_removed,i feel like its on a movie by movie basis here i watched the hateful eight on film and the intermission was good my friend told me in her home country sometimes they stop in the middle of a film not meant to have intermission to do intermission
movies,not_removed,every film ive seen at my local theater has had an intermission and im thankful for it means i can drink all the sprite i want without worrying about leaving partway through to use the bathroom
movies,not_removed,id hate for movies to start having intermissions it ruins the flow of the movies for me when i start watching i like to watch from beginning to end not have a random stopping point somewhere in the middle id probably go to far less movies than i do now if they started having an intermission during the movies
movies,not_removed,i feel like we may be seeing some of that more hopefully ex passengers coming out
movies,not_removed,god i miss before sequels
movies,not_removed,not everything had to be a god damn franchise
movies,not_removed,thats what happens when your product makes money
movies,not_removed,i know youre just making a joke but i really do feel like purely comedy movies are dying in a way and its at least in part due to the amount of humor thats already in high budget blockbusters at this point every marvel movie might as well be a comedy at this point with the amount of one liners hell i saw moana this past weekend and there were tons of cheap laughs if you look at the comedy movies of this decade and im talking comedy as the main genre aside from a few good ones like jump street and what we do in the shadows because im on reddit what are we left with two grownups movies and a few teds then you look at the comedies of the you have anchorman borat superbad shaun of the dead step brothers hot fuzz and so much morea few years ago if you asked what my favorite genre was i wouldve undoubtedly said comedy but now its not even in my top i dont know why im making this rant i just wanted to get it off my chest
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,auteur theory you can thank michael cimino for the death of that when you have given total control of a project and drive the budget so high it bankrupts the studio people are going to pay attention
movies,not_removed,to be fair there has always been a divide between big budget film directors and auteur directors auteur films with a big budget havent disappeared though not to sound like the rmovies circle jerk here but nolan tarantino wes anderson martin scorsese pta etc are still putting out large budget films and theyre all auteurs by andrew sarris definition
movies,not_removed,but auteur doesnt necessarily mean good technically michael bay is an auteur but his movies are terrible from any kind of analytical standpoint
movies,not_removed,i dont really get why big action movies feel obliged to start in the middle of an action sequence ive already paid you dont need to convince me its a cool movie
movies,not_removed,did you see sing street it was shot digitally but they went for a classic warm film look the grade it looks great and i was sure it was film in the theatre you are technically correct that film has no set resolution but in reality a digital image will resolve about as much detail as film
movies,not_removed,film doesnt have a set digital resolution in pixels but the resolution is limited because it can only resolve detail down to its grain size thats one of the reasons larger formats like and imax were necessary they were the way to get higher resolution images up onto the big screen there are reasons that people want to revive film but achieving maximum image clarity isnt really one of them anymore
movies,not_removed,truth
movies,not_removed,i actually really love post stuff and not because i enjoy making it theres so much you can do now to up your production value using a flick of a switch low budget filmmakers can suddenly reduce the ocean between them and hollywood to a river image shaky warp stabilizer overexposed lower the brightness objects in the shot add a layer over em and thats just some of the fixing stuff thats nothing the real meat is when used to enhance films i mean color correction alone straight up gives filmmakers the ability to create the look of their worlds
movies,not_removed,i think fantastic beasts really missed an opportunity there yes the cgi was excellent but it would have been so easy to reintroduce some practical models especially with the smaller things like ron perlmans goblin or the bowtruckle personally i found it hard to buy into the magical creatures just because i knew the actors were interacting with thin air anytime they were on screen i dont think they should automatically break out the cgi if there is an option for a decent practical model
movies,not_removed,we need everyone who makes this comment to watch this
movies,not_removed,is this a joke theres tons of original movies being made
movies,not_removed,or at least ideas that dont seem too familiar like arrival
movies,not_removed,do you mean comedies with dramatic endings if so i do miss completely straightforward comedies
movies,not_removed,i dont really know what you mean there are plenty of movies under hours
movies,not_removed,golf clap
movies,not_removed,that would be an awful idea for days all pas i know hate their body after hours lol
movies,not_removed,neat idea but that sounds miserable
movies,not_removed,those kinds of films were reacting to the sexparanoid and early by writing women who enjoyed sex as being a threat to the idea of hypermasculinity in america yay reagan dont get me wrong i love me some basic instinct but unless you made a film that was directly pointing to these issues it would be hard to get something like that greenlit today since noir is rarely made to comment on anything except its own decade but i totally agree that more erotic thrillers should be a thing it would just have to be updated for the time
movies,not_removed,same here
movies,not_removed,how about heimdall in thor he is god from norse mythology and yet he is black in the movie but it was said it´s not because of diversities sake but because of actor´s talent
movies,not_removed,examples
movies,not_removed,thats the one id say the same for optioning films based on similar criteria
movies,not_removed,back to your original point if actors where cast entirely on talent there would be a lot of very good looking white actors with far fewer parts there are better unknown actors out there than the same stale a listers turning in tired performances time and time again also without throwing too much shit acting just isnt that hard or i should say there are fucking loads of talented actors all ive the world they dont get the pats because they arent talented they dont get the pats because they are unknown in this case and in every case really diversity for the sake of diversity is good if it brings some new blood into the club
movies,not_removed,disney tried going back to its roots with princess and the frog and it didnt quite give them the return they wanted
movies,not_removed,the old school disney movies on blu ray make that animation look even more amazing
movies,not_removed,who says i didnt
movies,not_removed,people love ripping off nolan but they never do it in the right way say what you want about his films but the way he approaches large scale practical effects is the way to do it
movies,not_removed,to be fair a lot of those are studios golden tickets to the oscars which gives them a lot more flexibility on budget so they dont need to be shoestring but a lot of them have stories that wont need an awful lot in the first place so thats why that being said limitless lucy looper and chronicle that last one broke a combo are pretty interesting in how theyre out of this bracket but still work perhaps scifi films with a fairly bankable cast are in demand
movies,not_removed,well shit my mind is changed thanks for a really good comment
movies,not_removed,wasnt thirty million kind of a lot back in
movies,not_removed,dont forget gone girl
movies,not_removed,this comment is about times more thought out and better presented than mine thank you for replying
movies,not_removed,but when movie tickets with snacks cost what in the fuck i swear every time someone on this sub complains about movie theater prices the number gets higher and higher its like a satire of itself nobody is making you people buy worth of popcorn every time you go see a film
movies,not_removed,it seems like a though the higher movie budgets for the blockbusters get and the more financial risk they become the higher ticket prices will get at least that is the excuse they will use it seems almost like they would need different kind of theaters that have more reasonable ticket prices without dolby macaroni digitalanalog imax butt candy on each screen that or find ways to make them appealing and viable on the small screen which is hard because right now most people associate something that wasnt in theaters with a steaming pile of turdand there are so many great tv shows that let people invest way more into the characters and story all that said i do think you will see them again in some form or another they arent nearly as big of a financial risk and audiences will tire at some point of the choice between a huge blockbuster spectacle or investing hours and hours in a tv show which still feels pretty greatbut there are just so many now its impossible to keep up with all the great showsstories out there
movies,not_removed,i cant speak for everyone but i definitely try to i dont have the funds to see every movie that comes out at the moment so between dr strange and arrival obviously that was an easy choice and im so glad i gave arrival my money for a recent example i read dr strange is pretty decent but marvel has enough money atm
movies,not_removed,i thought that chief lazarus was a compelling villain you could really feel his emotions with each thrust
movies,not_removed,true but the full penetration scene made sense in context
movies,not_removed,why
movies,not_removed,isnt resolution the only thing keeping film relevant though
movies,not_removed,its not going to happen because its too expensive to ship reels in comparison to the digital format that and film just isnt really printed anymore and on top of that digital films dont degrade over the course of a run in theaters the film you see on opening day looks the same as it looks six weeks into the run no scratches no splices no dirt
movies,not_removed,terminator skynet reprogramming back to the future
movies,not_removed,such as m night shyamalans for instance
movies,not_removed,the back to the future teaser is the first that comes to mind i think thats be a neat way to help movies from getting spoiled
movies,not_removed,the first teaser for the star trek also super similar shots were in the film itself but its mostly from a different perspective
movies,not_removed,maybe not like that redux was unneeded and cut scenes added back in for the extra cashin apocalypse now is good as it is theatrical version
movies,not_removed,obviously its gotta be anticipated during the filmmaking process or else its definitely abrupt im sure a lot of people watching some of these hour epics wouldnt mind an appropriate break in the middle when the main protagonists are essentially just walking through a forest for minutes
movies,not_removed,no shit
movies,not_removed,i would like to see more comedies with heart not just vulgar shock humor which i appreciate but everything seems to be going this way even adam sandler where are the modern tommy boys and uncle bucks
movies,not_removed,the nice guys midnight in paris moonrise kingdom this is the end the trip submarine the grand budapest hotel alan partridge popstar four lions bridesmaids goon life after beth the lego movie seven psychopaths mr right were the millers deadpool they came together frances ha and hot tub time machine are all pretty fantastic films in my opinion there are a lot more but those are a few that i love
movies,not_removed,dont think you can blame cimino for that since there were plenty made after everything james cameron made burtonsnolans batman raimis spiderman now its more rare thanks to the cinematic universe shit
movies,not_removed,fair enough but in modern cinema i blame the likes of kevin feige more than cimino like icarus would it be better to have a safe success the mcu or an ambitious failure like the dccu
movies,not_removed,agreed never understood why its completely wrong with as they say circle jerk to directors you have mentioned maybe since they quality filmmakers we need to talk about them and learn from so the filmmakers in the future can make great films such as these gentlemen you have mentioned though its always a shame to see not enough people on that subreddit talk about kurosawa or bergman or even tarkovsky
movies,not_removed,usually there are more objectively good auteurs then the michael bay version of an auteur
movies,not_removed,ah yes everything about sing street was great but i loved the look of it
movies,not_removed,yep it was one of my favorites of the year it really looked like it was made in the
movies,not_removed,fantastic beasts used massive sets though i really liked that
movies,not_removed,fuck that models are cumbersome to work with practicals were a huge part of filmmaking when film was the standard it was easy to reset practicals when you were changing out reels which gave breaks in shooting digital technology has sped up production by quite a lot and as a result stuff like implementing cgi has grown more cost effective practicals still have a place but they are much harder to get working than cgi and mainstream audiences would likely scoff at a puppet these days
movies,not_removed,i dunno i watched top gun and while its not a great masterpiece or anything i really liked the fact that all the airborne footage is real that is now lost even in a blockbuster budget were not going to strap a couple of cameras on jet fighters anymore most of the time whole sequences like that would be done on a computer and its obvious i would mind it less if they did the real thing and used cgi to touch up or enhance the action mad max fury road did this very well but i feel like thats the exception i see so many modern action films now with cgi blood cgi explosion it just sucks practical squibs and explosions are so much better even in shitty movies they are enjoyable
movies,not_removed,thats a really good video no doubt but i suppose bmactldr means leaning on cgi even using it as a chair its interesting because if its just lazily thrown in it makes it all the more useless even if visuals that cgi can create look so stunning like a polished bmovie of sorts practical effects are actually there and even though great cgi can outshine those more often than not they need a purpose to actually be there its in a sense a constraint that allows for more creativity versus being far more relaxed when you can just do everything you want later
movies,not_removed,to me it seems that damn near every comedy hollywood makes either ends in well golly we learned our lesson or see kids everybodys special
movies,not_removed,not in the big release category
movies,not_removed,yeah it was probably easier when of a movie was made on the lot hey i dont hate my body after after yeah
movies,not_removed,yeah it would depend on the show
movies,not_removed,kind of a waste of idris elba though
movies,not_removed,then fair enough i have no problems because idris elba is a talented actor my problem is when it is done more so as a marketing piece to promote the movie
movies,not_removed,that and doing it was more of a contractual thing for their reacquiring pixar they had to let lassiter get a film out by then they were fully invested in animation
movies,not_removed,that had a lot to do with goddamn avatar coming out around the same time
movies,not_removed,agreed you can actually see the pencil lines its breathtaking
movies,not_removed,that was more to anybody around
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,probably because it doesnt seem like a movie that costs that much its people talking for two hours
movies,not_removed,seriously its not even for two people to go see a movie sure the tickets are but no one is forcing you to buy overpriced food cant you last hours without a drink or snack
movies,not_removed,i live between two move theaters one of them still does tuesdays and is a fine budget option not on tuesdays tickets are their popcorn prices are and respectively sodas are and have free refills they also serve beer each the other one went the other direction a single ticket is plus tax for reserved seating and they dont offer regular concessions they only offer combos small soda small popcorn and a candy is the cheapest offering and its only a second small drink can be addedon for only
movies,not_removed,i personally dont like movie theater popcorn its too fake when i go see a movie i usually get one of the more substantial food options like the pizza its not terribly good but its tasty pizza plus a large bottle of water plus two things of candy is closer to now its true that this isnt strictly necessary i could eat before the film and just get the bottle of water however even without the pizza i like to have something to munch on during the movie like an mms or something so with a candy and a water thats still in the range but if we are going to do an apples to apples comparison my numbers hold up because if im watching a movie at home ill probably order a pizza or something
movies,not_removed,totally disagree with your tv comment tv movies are still perceived as shit thats true but tv shows in general are in a golden age right lots of extremely well respected movie actors have been making the cross over to television as popular shows pull in millions of viewers every week and just think of the cultural impact as well as monetary shows like game of thrones true detective breaking bad etc have had
movies,not_removed,im not sure the price of equipping a theater has that much to do with the ticket prices its a one time cost and the theater will last for several years without major upgrades imax is of course the exception because it requires the giant screen that requires a giant theater which means either losing normal screens or buying a huge building either way the extra real estate is a huge upfront cost similar to the lack of revenue from smaller screens as for the small screen though i think thats already happening i see a couple of movies in amazon that i can buy for while they are still in theaters i think this is a recognition by the distributor that a movie might be strong enough for a theater release but might also have a significant audience that wants to see the movie but not badly enough to spend to take two people to it
movies,not_removed,ive yet to see a set of speakers plus a sub for under then you arent looking very hard and there are other cheaper ones maybe that wont fill a very big room but itll do the job ill give you that bluray players are generally but there are a handful refurbished on amazon in the range it also depends on what quality you want if you want everything then my numbers are a hair on the low side maybe low if you are fine with then you can save a couple hundred bucks by ordering new old stock of model hardware and my numbers are way high
movies,not_removed,good call doctor strange was ok but if youve seen any marvel movies from the last few years youre not missing much
movies,not_removed,large format film perhaps no one is shooting for superior resolution
movies,not_removed,if youre looking for heart and optimism in your comedy you might enjoy the trip midnight in paris safety not guaranteed jeff who lives at home moonrise kingdom the grand budapest hotel hot rod and mascots only the last four veer into the absurdity of stuff like tommy boy but they all have a lot of heart and beauty in them
movies,not_removed,icarus was a fool not a role model daedalus is the one who invented the wings and he accomplished what icarus in his hubris could not and the mcu was certainly ambitious as hell and still a success and dccu isnt really taking any big risks theyre just sucking at putting movies together at a fundamental level
movies,not_removed,safe success without a doubt safe success why because at this point the word safe doesnt mean shit in film or film criticism its just a word thrown around by armchair critics if something works in a film it works and if it doesnt it doesnt how safe it is doesnt matter
movies,not_removed,the mcu isnt safe at all guardians of the galaxy iron man and the avengers are all extremely risky projects they just paid off
movies,not_removed,then why not go for a mixture some of the best shots in fantastic beasts involved practical effects eg when newt got into his suitcase he actually went through a hole in the floor which they later edited out edit also a lot of cgi does just suck you have to do it extremely well nowadays because if its anything less than perfect it will look terrible and practical effects dont always look fake consider jurassic park
movies,not_removed,so you actually expect them to spend doble the money time and resources just to make the end result practically the same even if they have a way to make everything easier like they said in the video the effects can be really well done and you would be none the wiser
movies,not_removed,still not true
movies,not_removed,examples
movies,not_removed,some examples would help
movies,not_removed,maybe it was still a modest hit for them but i think they needed it to really breakout to justify the increased cost over their computer animation division
movies,not_removed,the problem with drama to be marketable is you absolutely need to show conflict to make up for the fact that you dont have the thrill that scifi does so in joy for instance you transition from miracle mop to jennifer lawrence holding a gun
movies,not_removed,while i agree that per person is a bit of an exaggeration that certainly sounds right for two people at about a small popcorn is usually at least get two of those and youre already over now imagine taking your family out to the theater for a night i understand skipping out on paying for any drinkssnacks during the film and i try to but for me and many others concessions are a part of the experience
movies,not_removed,the theater down the street from my apartment is per ticket
movies,not_removed,tickets here are for a normal movie for an imax i usually go see imax when its available but you could take off and go with the normal tickets and sure i can go hours without food but im making an apples to apples comparison if im going to do a movie night at my house im going to have a pizza and a drink there which improves the experience imho
movies,not_removed,i was just referring to tv movies yes it is definitely a special time for tv
movies,not_removed,yes but theatersstudios use those things to justify price increases did the masses really want at the time i would say not really but it was a way to gargle an extra a ticket and i think when all is said and done it being pure profit is kind of the idea it isnt a charity one the other hand the technologies go beyond the theater being equipped and things like imax etc do increase production costs
movies,not_removed,that speaker system is missing a receiver which is another bucks or so other than that spot on
movies,not_removed,not really these days digitals color range is practically comparable to what you get from film and what the human eye is actually capable of perceiving
movies,not_removed,thank you i think people forget that ironman was a relatively unknown superhero before the first film came out and they took a huge risk on hiring downey who was seen as a liability at the time then theres guardians of the galaxy i remember reading a few articles about how the movie would tank and lo and behold its my second favorite marvel film sure the marvel movies are formulaic and often have weak villains but marvel has taken some pretty big risks and the only reason people forgot those risks existed is because they paid off
movies,not_removed,icarus was a fool and yes marvel was ambitious in the beginning but now its all old hat and irrelevant im just getting sick of people treating a different interpretation of certain characters as some iconoclasm what is the fundamental level anyways
movies,not_removed,its the best modern example i could think of and i ambition in the confines of the superhero genre
movies,not_removed,safe dosent mean always mean bad but in case of marvel it is a detriment
movies,not_removed,in what way
movies,not_removed,well yeah thats obviously the best solution lucas for instance needed some semblance of practical world to interact with for episodes and the world felt hollow for lacking any real tangibility but my point stands hollywood would rather use cgi because it costs less to just make a lot of those things in post than it does to pay highname actors to be on set a few extra days obviously when youre doing something like a marvel film money isnt a huge issue but it still costs less to cgi in background details and characters than keep using that prop jaws that keeps falling apart and ruining shots
movies,not_removed,to be fair hes only showing clips that are second long to support his case and when it cuts to show the render or the individual plates it did surprise me that ugly betty scene for example i cant believe that only her character the pane of glass and the guy with the mic was the only real thing there but having said that im pretty sure during longer scenes your eyes can wander and see the flaws or in the case of cgi the flawlessness of an image
movies,not_removed,good talk
movies,not_removed,heimdall in thor
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,damn i now appreciate the theaters in my area more tickets and i believe a large wrefills popcorn is i cant imagine paying for just a ticket
movies,not_removed,exactly and since id have a pizza at home to do a real apples to apples comparison we need some kind of real food at the theater too you also make the very good point that the cost scaling for multiple people is different at the theater at home ill save whatever food is left over so the cost is exactly the same whether its person or people at the theater you have an almost linear price increase as you add people some may share snacks but thats not guaranteed to save much
movies,not_removed,the includes snacks the ticket is give or take but you throw in a decent snack order maybe a mini pizza a box of candy and a large bottle of water and thats easily another
movies,not_removed,well even so the guy above said it costs for one person
movies,not_removed,oh no doubt there id say the extra cost of a projector is probably peanuts compared to what theyll get from the more expensive tickets and yeah movies cost more to produce when you have imax massive cgi etc if im a studio or theater owner and people are going to see a movie every weeks id be doing everything in my power to make sure its a movie rather than a movie theres also a question of perceived value on the consumer side lets say im a moviegoer and i just saw the latest marvel action film in imax i paid plus snacks and for that money i got a very immersive experience full of excitement and sensory overload i cant get that at home and the marvel film takes full advantage of the big screen and huge sound if i watched the movie at home the experience wouldnt be nearly as immersive then i go home and load up netflix and watch some random drama film theres a lot of dialogue not much cgi and as long as my viewing hardware doesnt take away from the story i get a pretty nice movie watching experience put differently compared to watching the drama film in the theater im not losing very much by watching it at home for this i pay essentially nothing since i already own the tv and i subscribe to netflix where this leaves me im no longer paying to watch the movie im paying to experience the movie and if the movie is such that it wont add worth of experience by seeing it in a theater vs at home ill probably just grab it on netflix because when considering going to the theater to see an average film the question becomes is this worth the extra time and money and the answer these days is usually not really not when theres so many other entertainment options
movies,not_removed,thats fine and i think kind of a joke—daedalus and icarus were prisoners and made their escape as best they could but that doesnt change the fact that as told and with the options available icarus was a fool who lost his chance to escape not because he actively chose to fly instead of live but because he was a fool and got caught up in his own excitement and pleasure and then fell to his death in front of his father
movies,not_removed,except stanley is missing the point that icarus didnt do a shitty job on the wings for their purpose escaping he simply and foolishly pushed them too far the moral of the story isnt dont try to fly too high its dont be an idiot you can be ambitious and not stupid
movies,not_removed,in terms of making movies im talking about the fundamentals of story script and character dccu is sucking at all of those and thats why their films are failing not because theyre taking big risks batman v superman is the opposite of a risk and they fucked it up pretty badly
movies,not_removed,not really
movies,not_removed,i though idris elba did a good joband the role was pretty minor anyway anything beyond that
movies,not_removed,wow i dont know of any theater in ct that has tickets enjoy it while it lasts
movies,not_removed,same theater charges for their small snack package a soda popcorn and a candy they dont sell anything individually unless you buy a combo then stuff is available as an addon its like the dlc of real life i dont go to that theater
movies,not_removed,could you do better
movies,not_removed,exactly i mean why waste a great actor like elba in a diversity quota on a character who really should be white by any real logic and is in like scenes and gets like lines i mean its not like they couldnt have just cast him as the scientist guy instead or as the sheild agent who wasnt coulson or whatever
movies,not_removed,while bow tie and the like are for a standard weekend adult ticket there are definitely single digit ticket prices to be had even at full price examples include off the top of my head newtown town hall niantic cinemas groton naval base parkade in manchester apple in waterbury and apple in barkhamsted further there are plenty cheaper than the standard large chain gallery in colchester garden in norwalk and state in stamford around cant remember exactly bank street in new milford bethel or and whatever the one at trinity college is called to name a few
movies,not_removed,what relevance does that have at all do i need to be a pro basketball player to recognize a shitty free throw
movies,not_removed,i think heimdal was underwritten anyway and considering who loosely marvel uses nordic mythology anyway i wouldnt say including a black guy makes that big of a difference
movies,not_removed,by any real logic so our forefathers where racist so we better keep the racism in this updated retelling of the thor mythology that plays fast and loose with the original folk law is that the logic you are referring to
movies,not_removed,interesting i dont think any of those are near me but that brings up another problem even if there are cheap tickets to be had if they arent right in the center of things that means a decent drive now while as a ct resident im used to driving everywhere for everything the question is how far id want to drive for a cheap movie if it was right nearby then its a no brainer but if its drive mins for tickets or drive mins for tickets i have to ask if the extra mins of driving is worth saving and that goes back to the home theater angle assume its drive for cheap tix or get expensive tix close staying at home and watching it here still seems like a better option
movies,not_removed,no but if lets say you dont like how superman is being done in contemporary cinema ive always believed you should draw a comic write a screenplay rather than bitch about how its not some idealised form of it and clutch pearls
movies,not_removed,whatever reason there was i think we can all agree that casting black guy as one of the norse gods and heimdall is described as whitest of them all is really against any logic i don´t think i´ve ever heard anyone saying that he played that role badly it was good and he did a decent job imo and i like that character in movies but still can´t wrap my head around that it´s like casting white guy as one of the african tribe gods i mean why would you do that and i bet that there would much harsher respond from people if they did it
movies,not_removed,yeah but theres loosely and uh what the weirdest thing is just that its not mentioned i mean hes the only black person we see there and nobody remarks at all not even a handwoven explanation
movies,not_removed,no im saying that ancient norse people werent black and their gods werent either for gods sake heimdall in particular wasnt black httpsenwikipediaorgwikiheimdallr
movies,not_removed,rather than bitch about how its not some idealised form of it and clutch pearls cause thats a totally accurate description of how this conversation has gone down besides that the proposition is just ridiculous that if youre not directly involved as a creator in the field then you cant make criticisms im not a doctor so i cant complain when my doctor is sloppy and misdiagnoses something im not a carpenter so i cant complain if i find the builder has taken shortcuts and compromised the integrity of my house i should have just built my own its fine if you like dc—i do too—but lets not construct some ridiculous reality where its immune from fan or consumer criticism
movies,not_removed,news flash thor the property not the character is an americanised version of the original character it makes perfect sense to me that characters would be multicultural
movies,not_removed,its not since postdark knight trilogy films from dc is just fine good time bad times but i do belive what you have quoted me on is does fuel common criticisms by the likes of bob chipman it almost a catch since if you do the same shit over its boring and safe and when if you do something different you get called out being iconoclastic and theres no middle ground between them
movies,not_removed,i agree that dismissing the dccu films because they take liberties in adapting the characters is foolish i welcome that kind of imagination but the dccus biggest problem isnt iconoclasm its shoddy storytelling bvs imo was not held down because batman is over the edge or supes is kinda leveled by the modern worlds cynicism but rather by a bloated script that tried to shoehorn too much stuff into one film and so let no single plotline or character time to breathe dissecting the film you can pull out a lot of cool stuff and see the potential that led people to get behind the film and dump millions of dollars into it but that only heightens the frustration when the final result is muddled and unsatisfying but to be clear weve abandoned the whole you cant criticize because youre not making films and comics argument yes
movies,not_removed,i never even had that argument just that people should do their own film and comic based on ip if majot studios arent making their cup of tea but i do wonder how zack snyder got so much power nothing against the guy but i do wonder who did have to blow to get where he is
movies,not_removed,its probably a blue mat and a composite onto concrete and dust
movies,not_removed,had him slide down a section of pipe had him fall on a mat that was covered in dirt filmed with a high speed camera so he lands in slow motion
movies,not_removed,my guess is the ground was probably the just like a wrestling mat where its hard but not too hard then they just put some dirt and whatnot on it to make it look like he bounced off the concrete
movies,not_removed,i think waking life is less philosophical ruminations and more as linklater himself said kitchen sink and it did make me think about things ethan hawke and julie delpys conversation in bed kim krizans thoughts on the nature of language and even charles gunnings fucking madman rant judge not lest ye be judged but overall its just a stream of consiousness film
movies,not_removed,much as i loved knight of cups i admit that some people would consider this film as such especially when you hear the characters thoughts as they walk around and away from the cameras line of sight
movies,not_removed,anything by terrence malick
movies,not_removed,inception
movies,not_removed,interstellar and inception nolan is great at taking complex ideas and making them massmarketable but the last movie that he did that didnt feel like mental masturbation like him saying look how deep i am to me was the prestige not saying theyre bad movies in the least just yknow
movies,not_removed,interstellar that movie made me very anxious
movies,not_removed,welp i can die now
movies,not_removed,that photo is from sword of doom just a little fyi
movies,not_removed,anyone slightly interested in the mountain goats should see them if they perform nearby tickets are cheap and they put forth a ton of effort for the fans they had encores when i went and afterwards took photossigned stuff for free
movies,not_removed,hm interesting johnson has his directors commentary for looper also up there on soundcloud
movies,not_removed,such an iconic yet underappreciated voice
movies,not_removed,iwhat that was unexpected
movies,not_removed,its just gonna rip off the other star wars movies like tfa i guarantee it
movies,not_removed,cant really top this maybe have him write the official novelization too
movies,not_removed,we can both die now
movies,not_removed,cant help but think this release will increase their popularity tenfold
movies,not_removed,plus with the addition of matt douglas to the group this lineup is the best fullband version of them ive seen
movies,not_removed,iirc he recorded that while the film was in theaters as a way to encourage multiple viewings
movies,not_removed,yeah because a new hope was such a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiherosjourney
movies,not_removed,wolf in white van was pretty good might as well give him a shot
movies,not_removed,that book was very goodbizarre definitely a great debut novel
movies,not_removed,id like to talk about your relationship status your boyfriend and your girlfriend seems more interesting of a topic
movies,not_removed,gimmicky horror films with social commentary will always earn a lot of praise from critics and bloggers
movies,not_removed,sure interesting but i am trying to talk about movies here if its really necessary to explain my boyfriend and i have started to see another girl together were both communicative of what we expect and feel and we just have a lot of love that we want to share together anyway did you really read that whole post just to comment on my relationship
movies,not_removed,and also if were being semantic here and youve expressed interest technically it would be my boyfriend and our girlfriend which is how we talk about it
movies,not_removed,if anyone is reading obligatory spoilers its justi am so disenfranchised by that film i dont even understand what the social commentary being made is supposed to be i dont get it its like at first it seems like maybe theyre kidnapping black people for slaves and whoa nope its cause theyre auctioning off their bodies and fuck yea the protagonist killed them all and escaped but wait why was all this stuff before relevant sorry we all just talked about this for lile hours straight after seeing it and i just dont get it
movies,not_removed,the movie was racist thats my take on it
movies,not_removed,can you clarify on why im not trying to attack or disgree i would just love to discuss it
movies,not_removed,i had no idea this was even a thing just signed up
movies,not_removed,darn place top tho was a lot of fun defintely playing this upcoming season
movies,not_removed,what a cool idea signed up as mandatory suicide squad
movies,not_removed,hi im new to this and im having some trouble making my line up for example lets say i want to put kubo in position i click the box and click kubo then its in position however then i want to put the light between oceans in so i click the fourth box and the light between oceans when i do that it automatically jumps in front of kubo into the number spot the same thing happens when i try to put a lower movie in front of a movie thats predicted to do better
movies,not_removed,this is absolutely amazing and i am upset i just now learned of this is there a subreddit for this league i signed up for this league and i fully intend on making all my friends play in a separate league this is more than cool
movies,not_removed,thank you for these posts i found out about fml from this sub after the summer season started but i wound up winning the prize for best cineplex started during my week i think i was pretty lucky but i am excited for the new season to start
movies,not_removed,good idea
movies,not_removed,i am coming for all of you this season
movies,not_removed,well i ended up in position out of guess thats not too bad heres hoping i can pick it up for fall season
movies,not_removed,finished and cracked the top overall after having a disastrous past season heres to hoping i can move up even more this season pmd to claim my flair
movies,not_removed,this week will test that theory as there are no thursday previews tonight
movies,not_removed,haha i was guess that makes you my sworn nemesis you have made a powerful enemy this day
movies,not_removed,so you have screens in your cineplex you are not necessarily putting them in order of box office gross you are just putting the combination of movies that makes the most overall money while keeping in mind your budget there should be a faq somewhere on the website that is a major help in understanding all the rules i can also answer any additional questions if needed furiosa
movies,not_removed,so i just signed up to do this too but from what i understand even if you select kubo for if it is not the second most expensive pick for the week then it will be bumped down for example your first three lineup could be dont breathe suicide squad and kubo kubo would be third because this week it cost the lest amount to pick of the three
movies,not_removed,ah ok i got it now thanks a lot
movies,not_removed,this is correct the game will automatically order your screens from highest priced to lowest price
movies,not_removed,wrong subreddit
movies,not_removed,if youre interested op or anyone i made a similar spreadsheet last year for all oscar nominees in the big categories picture actor actress director its color coded and goes all the way because to the first academy awards if youre looking for it to be a checklist it should be easy to add another column for that ps the bolded ones are movies i was particularly interested in checking out as i was looking these all up
movies,not_removed,after watching this years academy awards i discovered ive watched far too few oscarnominated flicks i couldnt find a resource with a checklist of recentish movies so i decided to build one using the httpawardsdatabaseoscarsorg the criteria was super easy any movies that were nominated for best actor best actress or best picture were included in the checklist between and there were total movies nominated i added a ranking system for loved for meh and for disliked for my own records so i can filter them down at a later date which you can use or not use there are also columns for date watched and notes if any please feel free to let me know if there were any mistakes this was literally put together today
movies,not_removed,this is so awesome i dont know why i didnt stumble across this before tt i searched on google and reddit before deciding i had to make one thank you for sharing
movies,not_removed,in college when i was near broke that was a standard practice
movies,not_removed,our theaters around here have movies on tuesday and on thursday its movies and free popcorn for college students that enables us to go to the movies pretty frequently and pay for every movie we see i dont think movie hopping is really justifiable once youre an adult
movies,not_removed,i only do it if im feeling cheap just make sure you use the bathroom in between movies so you dont get caught
movies,not_removed,movie hopping was a big part of my childhood i was a kid so i didnt have the money to watch all the movies i wanted to so my friends and i would movie hop once a month watching films the routine was movie hop around noon until late afternoon go to the local fast food joint pig out on burgers or whatever and talk about why this movie was awesome or why this actor sucked it was essentially the only version of rmovies my friends and i would have at the time it was a great bonding experience for all of us and till this day one of my fondest memories now as an adult i rarely go to the theaters last time i saw a movie in the theater was deadpool and i went by myself because coordinating a theater night with friends is a pain in the ass now that were all older in fact next film i plan to see in the theater is the nice guys and i plan on seeing it by myself i dont get to see my friends as often because we all have our own lives so instead of discussing films with them i discuss it with strangers on the internet how times have changed lol
movies,not_removed,i did it once went to see mirrors and step brothers with some friends in the same night
movies,not_removed,i used to do it all the time till i got movie pass it can get exhausting though and you have to plan it perfectly but yeah in high school i did it twice a month at least
movies,not_removed,yeah the workers at my theater dont do anything its so easy lol
movies,not_removed,same here best way to get two for the price of one
movies,not_removed,i dont know why youre getting downvotes the guy just really wanted to see watchmen lol

movies,not_removed,frank from donnie darko maybe not a creature but that was the first time for me the monster of the movie wasnt all teeth and claws he was intelligent creepy knew how to get under you skin and just had an aura of strangeness that just made him unsettling and the final twistreveal for him just kind of skewed that view i had of him through the whole movie really fantastic
movies,not_removed,the surprisingly friendly jeans clad alien from the alien factor
movies,not_removed,of all the horror films ive seen it is a creature from a fairly soft film that for some reason gets me those giant nematode worms with teeth from peter jacksons king kong just the way is slowly deliberately immobilised then gives me shivers

movies,not_removed,the blob from the remake because of the sadistic ways it kills a lot of its victims
movies,not_removed,not really one creature but the scene in indiana jones and the temple of doom when the woman is stuck in that room with all the bugs destroyed me for life
movies,not_removed,the blob from well the blob

movies,not_removed,reading most of the examples from people in this thread just reminds me how young everyone is never mind the references to the original blog film that horrified millions of americans when it came out never mind the people leaving the theater to throw up when the original alien came out or texas chainsaw massacre the pale man from pans labyrinth was creepy but nothing compared to how shocking scary and disturbing the alien was in alienaliens the chest buster the alien design the people hanging on the wall held by secretion always gave me chills
movies,not_removed,michael rooker in slither
movies,not_removed,the monster that haunts lucie in martyrs
movies,not_removed,babadook
movies,not_removed,maybe not the absolute most disturbing thing but i think its worth mentioning the jack in the box monster from krampus fuck that thing was creepy
movies,not_removed,melted guy from the original robocop young me was not prepared for that shit
movies,not_removed,christian bale in the machinist
movies,not_removed,hell hounds
movies,not_removed,anything in the thing or the blob and what it does to people shivers pure cold shivers
movies,not_removed,the alien that walks past the window during the birthday party in signs it has fueled my nightmares for years
movies,not_removed,peachfuzz because of mark duplass in creep
movies,not_removed,tbh the creatures in the attic sequence of krampus messed with my head when i watched it a couple weeks ago
movies,not_removed,something about that movie splice bugged me only watched it once but i still remember every scene
movies,not_removed,elmur from brain damage shudders
movies,not_removed,im really surprised none of you thought this was disturbing
movies,not_removed,william dafoe
movies,not_removed,not mentioned yet but seriously fuck this guy
movies,not_removed,pretty much everything has been mentioned and the work of h r giger and john carpenter will haunt me forever however im going to give a shout out to an old b movie classic the blob looking back on it now it is as cheesy as hell and stars steve mcqueen as the oldest teenager in history however i think the whole slow creeping horror thing was what made it unnerving a shapeless killer that didnt stop lock the door and itll just ooze through the gaps and keep coming but what really freaked me out as a kid was how it dispatched its first victim it was just a tiny gel thing that climbed up a stick to attach to the old guys hand but that was it there was nothing he could do after that it just very slowly ate him alive
movies,not_removed,the thing from john carpenters movie followed closely by alien
movies,not_removed,the creature from splice still gives me the creeps to this day
movies,not_removed,the demons from dead birds their design itself isent that creepy but the fucking movie build the suspense for min at a time and then unleashes
movies,not_removed,probably that one in splice disturbing because its kind of hot so hot in fact adrian brodys character fucked it then it turned into a male and raped the other character weird movie is an understatement
movies,not_removed,you know whats crazy it might be justin long in tusk
movies,not_removed,the werewolf in bad moon used to give me a lot of nightmares too werewolves in general but that one in particular for some reason
movies,not_removed,the killer worms from i think that scene speaks for itself
movies,not_removed,the from house of corpses was a bit disturbing but for me nothing matches the horrifying intensity of the alien abduction scene from fire in the sky httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwsjhdowktxm
movies,not_removed,this is a very hard one for me im almost and i have seen more creatures than i can remember i think the doll from reincarnation is the most disturbing thing ive ever seen
movies,not_removed,im not even sure what it is but that thing towards the end of house of corpses its chasing the girl and at one point pulls its mask off and pukes up this grey slimy shit yea that thing
movies,not_removed,i have a few gmork from neverending story darkness in legend
movies,not_removed,not a movie but the worms from the strain all it takes it one and youre done ironically in the show the vamps themselves are oddly adorable
movies,not_removed,not biological creatures but the endoskeleton at the end of the terminator and from robocop scared the shit out of me still do
movies,not_removed,i have two the cockroachmanthing that julian sands turns into during naked lunch and the weird demon thing that is dancing with tim robbins wife in jacobs ladder
movies,not_removed,this might be a weird answer but does anyone remember that bad movie the brothers grimm there is this scene where a girl loses her face and that was really creepy to me
movies,not_removed,its pretty cheesy but the only thing that comes to mind is i was checking under the car every time i went to the garage for a year after that eta the blob i mean its basically unstoppable by any weapon can grow to the size of a building and it consumes you alive terrifying shit
movies,not_removed,absentia had some weird shit going on parasite freaked me out a bit
movies,not_removed,the thing
movies,not_removed,when i was a kid the mechano woman from superman terrified me regular woman gets trapped in computer and transformed into killer robot very child friendly
movies,not_removed,monster in the closet
movies,not_removed,doom
movies,not_removed,cant believe i am the first one to say this but the nun demon in the conjuring might be the most terrifying horror creature i have seen it is so simple yet so fucking creepy also love the way they turn a worship song into impending doom
movies,not_removed,the jumping man from twin peaks fire walk with me film fuck this guy freaked me out
movies,not_removed,pyramid head mama is disturbing but shes not a creature
movies,not_removed,donald trump in home alone ill see myself out
movies,not_removed,all of the like super mutantszombies in resident evil movies really made me horrified and grossed out at the same time especially in later movies where things split their mouths open in ways
movies,not_removed,that evil teacher lady from harry potter i always secretly hoped that somebody would just drop a brick on her head from about a hundred feet up
movies,not_removed,the room from with john cusack
movies,not_removed,probably something from thirteen ghosts
movies,not_removed,the creeper from jeepers creepers
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,apparently the director since admitted the trolls were too scary fun fact those trolls were the same base costumes used in killer klowns from outer space another source of nightmares for me
movies,not_removed,i sure hope youre from keebler
movies,not_removed,yes that thing gave me nightmares too way too scary for a childrens movie
movies,not_removed,god do you remember when the kid is skating home and the fucking troll just runs in out of nowhere and snatches him that shit was terrifying
movies,not_removed,i watched this movie when i was and im just going to say it it freaked me out a bit not a ton but i was not expected that from a fucking ernest movie
movies,not_removed,the opening to ernest scared stupid always scared the hell out of me as a kid
movies,not_removed,seeing this at age was way too much for me this movie is the reason my parents kept me away from scary movies for so long i was unable to sleep in my own room for a good while
movies,not_removed,i reference this movie all the time as something that stuck with me as a kid more than any other scary film the girl rolling over in her bed and seeing the troll there next to her and the lights were on thats supposed to mean youre safe ghaaaaa
movies,not_removed,i havent called milk milk in years its exclusively miak
movies,not_removed,in the new season of black mirror the episode playtest has a spiderlike creature which reminded of the things ability to turn into whatever to escape the thing was my first thought specifically the spider head after the body eats the defibrillator hands
movies,not_removed,edward
movies,not_removed,you gotta be fucking kidding me
movies,not_removed,that or the creature the dog morphs into in the kennel pretty grotesque
movies,not_removed,man that spoiler creeped me out
movies,not_removed,everything about the thing being the thing was fucking super creepy that movie is still fucking scary as hell for me its chest mouth when that guy is trying to resuscitate him with the shock paddles
movies,not_removed,omg the dogman is definitely it fun fact the music that plays when he dances around was jerry garcia
movies,not_removed,i think the thing in general is a damn scary monster not only can it mimic pretty much any living thing it also turns into big gross multilimbed monstrosities not only that its also basically a scared cornered animal that lashes out when it feels too cornered scared animals are scary man
movies,not_removed,you have got to be fuckin kidding fawooooshhhhh lets be honest thats what any human would have said at that point its one of the reasons i love the movie people act like people not actors
movies,not_removed,that dwarf was also so weird in a realistic movie it was so out of it
movies,not_removed,i was going to say the dog in fly
movies,not_removed,i refuse to watch that movie purely because jeff goldblum is my god my idol and i refuse to see him become deformed
movies,not_removed,this should be the top choice the entire movie and every mutation is more disturbing than the previous one
movies,not_removed,brudlefly
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,and its not even close for me
movies,not_removed,when she scoops his face off at the end i completley lost my shit
movies,not_removed,httpwwwchristopherwalkeniswatchingyoupeecomjgiwyp
movies,not_removed,i knew it i knew this fucker would be at the top jesus i hate that thing
movies,not_removed,easily the most criminally underutilized halloween costume idea as well
movies,not_removed,i was hoping there was some pans labyrinth up in here
movies,not_removed,does captain vidal count as a creature you bet your ass he does and what a monster he is worse then any of the other creatures in that movie
movies,not_removed,we have a winner first thing that came to my mind as well
movies,not_removed,yes came here for this answer my friend and i used to freak each other out by putting our hands over our faces and then reaching creepily towards one another haha
movies,not_removed,i knew this would be in here its nightmarish
movies,not_removed,this after the xenomorph in alien this is imo the greatest creature design in film history
movies,not_removed,yeah man giulio del toro monsters always make me uneasy like im not scared or grossed out by it but damn i dont feel comfortable when theyre on screen
movies,not_removed,reminds me of httpwwwvandalhighcoms series of
movies,not_removed,its interesting because its much closer to biblical descriptions of angels than most angels depicted in popular culture
movies,not_removed,man i always forget how good hellboy ii is
movies,not_removed,i havent seen hellboy thats gorgeous i know what im watching tonight
movies,not_removed,and both the angle of death and the pale man were played by doug jones
movies,not_removed,man i love del toros monsters
movies,not_removed,it reminds me of et i kinda like it
movies,not_removed,you know what creeps me out nobody knows how they made it also what life would that thing live
movies,not_removed,the ending is creepy and hilarious its so good
movies,not_removed,oh you are sick no shit henry
movies,not_removed,second only to evil dead for so much gross shit spilling out of a creature at the end of a movie
movies,not_removed,i was just about to say that what even is it
movies,not_removed,the first shot when the guy in the suit is shown was truly unsettling like i was shown something that i cant quite grasp the feeling lovecrafts writing can only give
movies,not_removed,i made the mistake of watching this movie high and it fucking scarred me for a while his situation was just so helpless and disturbing and it scared the shit out of me and i just couldnt figure the suit out is the entire thing him or is all the fat covering him a suit like the one the crazy dude wears fucked up movie
movies,not_removed,yep i was waiting for this one you think that maybe the old man is gonna sew his hands to his side and make a silly looking walrus man but nope they went full out
movies,not_removed,the drowned one he sees when he tried to swim was a legitimately disturbing image for me
movies,not_removed,this movie ruined the best date i ever had i wanted to stop like minutes in but she insisted we finish it super awkward and we never spoke again damn you kevin smith
movies,not_removed,yeah it bothered me as well just the idea of being imprisoned in your own body and unable to communicate except for screams and pleading eye expressions i was genuinely unnerved by it
movies,not_removed,the ending of this movie really pisses me off with how unrealistic it is not the part with the walrus suit the fact that he basically had to live the rest of his life in some shitty zoo out in the middle of nowhere youre telling me this shit wouldnt be national news immediately fucking bus drivers get money thrown at them on the internet if a video comes out of them being maligned but some dude who had to suffer this horrific shit wouldnt get some better treatment motherfucker would be on tv getting fed fish by doctor phil within the week
movies,not_removed,i sat here too long thinking tusk was an acronym trying to figure out what it could possibly stand for before reading the rest of the comments damn
movies,not_removed,the goo under the raft and the space moss are very memorable too i used to love creepshow and its sequel so much
movies,not_removed,goddamn piranha yeti
movies,not_removed,holy shit id forgotten about this ಠಠ
movies,not_removed,tell it to call you billie
movies,not_removed,yes creepshow is my favorite horror film of all time thats my favorite segment as well for me it goes the crate fathers day something to tide you over the lonesome death of jordy veril and theyre creeping up on you
movies,not_removed,love those creatures that you have to use your imagination to flesh out theyre always the scariest
movies,not_removed,splice broke my soul man i did a back to back adrian brody night starting with the pianist and moving immediately to splice no go back to playing piano dont fuck it
movies,not_removed,i think your list is top all the way the thing is crazy unsettling the noise it makes just by opening its mouth is so haunting the xeno is always terifying in the right hands i think
movies,not_removed,yeah when did xenomorphs become everyones friend i saw the first film when i was nine and they still freak me out the only positive thing i have to say about them is that biologically speaking they are bad ass
movies,not_removed,to this day i still dont know what to think of splice it was just such an odd experience
movies,not_removed,its like a mirrored version of
movies,not_removed,i didnt need to be reminded of this
movies,not_removed,wtf is this
movies,not_removed,the fat one licking his lips is great too less so the pink foetal monster thing
movies,not_removed,the fat slob chatterbox makes pinhead look like casper the friendly ghost
movies,not_removed,fun fact when each of the cenobites dies in hellraiser they return to their original human forms pinhead turns back into elliot spencer but the chatterer turns back into a teenage boy
movies,not_removed,why do you wear that stupid human suit
movies,not_removed,or frank from its always sunny in philadelphia man the way he slickly peeled his way birthing from the couch being born into this world his birth cry fortelling misery and suffering and rumham
movies,not_removed,god the scene in the therapists office where donnie just goes hes right there or something and the camera cuts to reveal frank just looming there freaks me out every time
movies,not_removed,i was finding him scary until the theater scene
movies,not_removed,wow thats pretty unsettling reminds me of xtro for some reason edit heres a bit of disturbing shit
movies,not_removed,this is unrelated to metamorphosis the alien factor right
movies,not_removed,that gif is nightmare fuel
movies,not_removed,yeah this would be my pick too the way he flings his machete about after his head is engulfed is so pitiable and horrifying it gave me nightmares
movies,not_removed,that whole scene is just messed up i mean im not really afraid of bugs or anything but theres a lot of horrible deaths in those couple of minutes the dude that was climbing to the top and ended up getting wrecked by some tall insect thing was pretty horrifying one second youre rooting for the guy for trying something different and the next second hes just gone off to a horrifying ending
movies,not_removed,often used for fishing bait are very similar to those thankfully theyre quite a bit smaller
movies,not_removed,that guy is gollum and supreme leader snoke
movies,not_removed,it still bothers me to this day that whole movie felt unnecessarily gross even compared to the first three like that chesburster coming out of that guys head and the weird pregnant queen ewww
movies,not_removed,the room full of cloned ripleys bothered me more
movies,not_removed,this movie deosnt get much love here but that thing was damn unsettling to me in particular the sounds it was making during its overlong demise shudder i felt a combination of pity and revoltion
movies,not_removed,managed to one up the horror of the failed clones room
movies,not_removed,i remember watching this movie late at night when i was younger i still regret that to this day thing is freaky as fuck it mainly had to do with the human eyes they gave it and then the fact that it was her child oh and those saggy boobs
movies,not_removed,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
movies,not_removed,i cant stand a single minute of dark crystal and not be completely scared i dont even need the bad guys even the good ones scare me am i weird
movies,not_removed,i saw that movie way too young while my parents were out when they came back i was sobbing they were mad at my brothers for letting me watch something so scary that it made me cry but i wasnt crying out of fear i was heartbroken when he put the gun barrel to his head asking the woman he loved to end it in a moment of clarity it was the saddest fucking thing id ever seen
movies,not_removed,and the dog in the sequel omg i watched the movie as a kid and it traumatized me i still refuse to watch it
movies,not_removed,it makes me very uncomfortable during the whole scene especially when it wins the struggle and they both just lay there truly the face hugger but at least five times as bad
movies,not_removed,i remember watching a video on how in alien they tried to combine sexual visuals with the violence to make it scarier i think the face huggers are the best example of this they literally rape and impregnate their victims and no gender is spared
movies,not_removed,yeah this is my answer that thing fucking repulses me
movies,not_removed,rconfusedboners
movies,not_removed,reminds me of the face huggers in hl me and the so call em head turkeys
movies,not_removed,its played by the same actress that played the terrifying nun in the conjuring as well
movies,not_removed,lynch does such an incredible job building tension out of practically nothing that scene with the detective describing his dream in the diner was so so foreboding and creepy seriously one of my favorite scenes ever
movies,not_removed,nothing in movies has ever given me a shock that froze my spine like this thing
movies,not_removed,this was the first thing i thought of and i assumed tons of people had already said it im glad at least someone agrees with me
movies,not_removed,i thought they were way scarier before they show them up close
movies,not_removed,as far as video game movie adaptations go silent hill was surprisingly great the lying figure made me feel ill when i first saw it
movies,not_removed,in his defense he seems to be having a bad day
movies,not_removed,definitely not the sort of i would have expected a poltergeist sequel apparently they hired hr geiger as a concept artist
movies,not_removed,oh god why
movies,not_removed,kane himself honestly
movies,not_removed,i just recently saw this agreed when you can see them as just shadows in the portal theyre so imposing and strange the tension was high in that scene
movies,not_removed,and dont forget the marble rye lady shudders
movies,not_removed,part man part blart
movies,not_removed,i believe she was called sadaako sp real creepy movie btw i remember watching the japanese version when i was a kid
movies,not_removed,belial
movies,not_removed,the sequel has some fantastically over the top creatures in it
movies,not_removed,that was my earliest gnarliest childhood fear
movies,not_removed,gmork
movies,not_removed,id seen american werewolf in london way too young and never ending story came out while i was still in my period of deep wolf phobia was glad when atreyu kills it and its revealed to be a big muppet
movies,not_removed,that whole movie to this day gives me nightmares artax jesus christ way to scar a kid
movies,not_removed,jesus christ wtf is that thing
movies,not_removed,still makes me question whether or not its a kids movie
movies,not_removed,you were not alone oddly enough falcor was right up there with the gmork too i dunno something about his waxy appearance creeps me out
movies,not_removed,cant tell you how frightened i was the first time i watched
movies,not_removed,those were demons
movies,not_removed,that one is superfreaky because inside its still a human girl so after the demon made her stab herself twist neck etc she had to go back and live with the injuries
movies,not_removed,what about captain howdys face when it appears in the kitchen horrible
movies,not_removed,unless you got a pulse rifle the thing i find most scary about xenomorphs is the absence of eyes plus they are quite intelligent
movies,not_removed,i still am guaranteed to have a nightmare once a year that involves the alien creature trying to get me i first watched the original film when i was i think it easily remains the best movie monster to this day
movies,not_removed,reportedly the guy who played chatterer in the first hellraiser was unbearably chipper all of the other cenobite actors were stuck in the make up chair for hours on end and trapped in their costumes for the duration of the shoot whereas his prosthetic was a simple rubber mask with teeth that could be easily taken off and put back on between takes he couldnt see shit though so i guess theres a trade off
movies,not_removed,same here
movies,not_removed,fun fact thats actually a woman
movies,not_removed,this one makes me so sad though like cant you not kill me dear
movies,not_removed,im thirsty
movies,not_removed,that thing is horrifying i can still hear its fucking endless screams
movies,not_removed,honestly its the best representation of that story hands down from the characters to the monsters my only complaint is grendls mother but that was easy to overlookdat ass
movies,not_removed,well that is indeed a creature
movies,not_removed,shes not that badqueue scene of her eating dog shit
movies,not_removed,that movie terrified me i remember that scene in particular and it made me shiver because of how much it made me jump the first time i watched that
movies,not_removed,hahaha what the fuck id forgotten about that thing so strange
movies,not_removed,that takes second place to the goddamn spider horse real talk i had a nightmare about that exact same situation when i was little years before this movie even started production needless to say there was some surprise trauma when i saw that shit on the big screen
movies,not_removed,butit was just darth maul no matter what thats all i could see and it made it less scary than it could have been
movies,not_removed,designed and built by carlo rambaldi the guy who created et and the fully animatronic grey from close encounters apparently nobody to this day knows how he got the quality of skin he used on the grey and the devil creature from possession all closely guarded trade secrets
movies,not_removed,thanks for mentioning this yeah i agree out of all the films i have seen i cant think of a creature possibly more disturbing than the one in possession saw that movie recently and the shot especially of that thing when heinrich visits annas apartment is fucking nightmarish
movies,not_removed,bob had such a legit crazy eye
movies,not_removed,man i said the eraserhead baby but goldblum in the fly might be the real answer i dont get shaken by movies often but i still wont eat a piece of food i see a fly landing on over a decade later
movies,not_removed,this
movies,not_removed,wouldst thou like to live deliciously
movies,not_removed,the monster at the end or the duck
movies,not_removed,that movie fucked me up solid who the fuck thought it was an appropriate design for a movie children would watch
movies,not_removed,that opening sequence was terrifying back in the day that girl stripping the skin off her wrists to pull free of the manacles while the unseen dragon smashes everything to pieces around her then later the princess getting her foot eaten off on screen edited out for the video release that movie is a bloodbath fun fact the priest who gets brutally torched by the dragon is senatoremperor palpatine
movies,not_removed,i feel like your talent was wasted because you were late to the party bravo 👏
movies,not_removed,damnit
movies,not_removed,specially the slimy brainbug
movies,not_removed,rthalassophobia
movies,not_removed,yes leptirica love that movie so creepy
movies,not_removed,watertank ghost effect wish fx people did more of that amazing old optical stuff
movies,not_removed,holy shit dude i thought it was the only one i can remember seeing it on tv at a really early age and i guess its the uncanny valley of they look normal but not that fucked me up something serious still makes me uncomfortable to look at
movies,not_removed,ive never seen it would you say that ben affleck was in fact the bomb in this movie
movies,not_removed,book was way better
movies,not_removed,ive never been able to get anyone to watch this with me ha five minutes in and they nope the fuck out
movies,not_removed,starger was a great character
movies,not_removed,wtf did you just make me watch
movies,not_removed,holy fuck why did i google that
movies,not_removed,the dogs will forever haunt my dreams lol
movies,not_removed,preach scary shit
movies,not_removed,jesus its like a deformed gorilla with ballsacks for eyes
movies,not_removed,well he shouldnt say such things you dont make a movie called scared stupid and just do that stuff halfway you gotta pump the gas
movies,not_removed,same base costume or creatures created by the same team chiodo brothers i believe
movies,not_removed,i also remember that troll being rather scary
movies,not_removed,yep that was the bit that freaked me out the most then the way he smiles while she screamsshudder
movies,not_removed,that episode was fantastic it didnt get as much praise as some of the other episodes but as a horror fanatic and a sucker for cliché american accents it was my favourite out of the new season
movies,not_removed,brb calling mom
movies,not_removed,i just watched it last night before bed it was really good im getting hooked on the show
movies,not_removed,that delivery tho
movies,not_removed,the dog in fly is so much worse i genuinely hate thinking about it ugh
movies,not_removed,that was first movie i cried during i am not a big crier during movies although i have many emotions during them but that poor dog just killed me i was young and cried with my mommy mom cries at everything
movies,not_removed,oh man the dog i had wiped that clean from my memory why did you make me remember why did you make me remember
movies,not_removed,you should watch it he is fucking great in it
movies,not_removed,if hes your idol then youre robbing yourself hes incredible and its possibly his best performance
movies,not_removed,i think brundle fly is even more beautiful than goldblum as a straight human
movies,not_removed,giulio who
movies,not_removed,yeah man giulio del toro monsters always make me uneasy like heres the secret fuck with the face humans relate with and acquire the most information from the face so if its got no eyes or too many eyes or whatever its much more effective than other bodily horror
movies,not_removed,holy shit these are awesome thanks
movies,not_removed,source
movies,not_removed,the angle of death
movies,not_removed,he also played abe sapien and the chamberlain in hellboy ii
movies,not_removed,i actually think the baby is kind of cute in a weird way its those eyes man
movies,not_removed,that thing wasnt really a creepy looking monster to the people in the movie it was made alien like to show how scary fatherhood can be that to a new dad a normal baby can seem strange and foreign
movies,not_removed,thought i read somewhere that they had a little burial ceremony for it after filming was over thing creeps me the hell out
movies,not_removed,the suit was made from his skin and the skin from other people that the old man kidnapped you can see multiple ears and even the remains of a human face on the walrus suit
movies,not_removed,not to try and one up you here but i made the mistake of watching that movie on acid fuck that movie i watched it again sober to get it out of my system but im definitely done with tusk forever lol
movies,not_removed,yeah to me the movie jumped the shark when that part happened it was good up until that point the whole idea that he could be psychologically broken just because his body was disfigured is just stupid like his brain is still human he wouldnt mentally transform that stupid twist ending was just a giant troll from kevin smith
movies,not_removed,the space moss meteor shit
movies,not_removed,the goo under the raft more like the goo in my adolescent pants from those honkers
movies,not_removed,the goo under the raft is the only reason i watch creepshow so weird
movies,not_removed,theyll creep up on you is the scariest for me i absolutely hate cockroaches and i live in a country where theres barely any of them
movies,not_removed,that goo under the raft messed me up when i was little i still get the heebies thinking about it there was an ask reddit thread a few months back that i commented about it and went and watched it and that shit still creeps me out
movies,not_removed,i believe it was based on the hp lovecraft short story the colour out of space
movies,not_removed,so many teethyikes
movies,not_removed,splice was such a weird movie it took a turn from kind of shitty to holy fuck is adrien brody having sex with their alien baby
movies,not_removed,splice porn
movies,not_removed,the one time i actually wanted a porn parody of something
movies,not_removed,the only alien thing ive viewed is alien isolation so im fucking terrified of the things
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,he fat one licking his lips is great too butterball
movies,not_removed,he looks scary contains spoilers
movies,not_removed,correct though
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,also was king kong in the movie as well and caesar from the new pota series
movies,not_removed,it was definitely meant to be more of a gross out dark comedy in the aliens universe rather than a tonally accurate sequel
movies,not_removed,that whole movie felt unnecessarily gross even compared to the first three probably because that movie is equivalent to shitty fan fiction in quality
movies,not_removed,joss whedon for ya
movies,not_removed,fizzgig made me jump out my skin first time i saw him
movies,not_removed,nope me too i could never watch that movie as a kid and i havent tried as an adult either
movies,not_removed,yes
movies,not_removed,it hit me pretty bad too my stepfather was dying of pancreatic cancer and basically what the movie was about was a guy dying of cancer
movies,not_removed,i refuse to watch the sequel for alot of reasons
movies,not_removed,yes i too watched that dog scene in the sequel and said never gonna watch that again
movies,not_removed,even crazier that thing was the squid inside of whatshernames abdomen
movies,not_removed,and they look like giant evil vaginas
movies,not_removed,i know its a cracked article bu there are some good sources in there
movies,not_removed,ya almost gave me a heart attack
movies,not_removed,yeah but i have a fear of large crawling things so this movie is my kryptonite
movies,not_removed,theyre coming up from pretty far down a cave youve got to give them some time
movies,not_removed,all mall
movies,not_removed,dont parp with his tart
movies,not_removed,plart blart mart cart
movies,not_removed,sadako is the girl in the original japanese in the american version shes samara morgan which is really hard to forget as they say her full name dozens of times in the movie
movies,not_removed,its not its a deep movie that touches on some serious subjects kids wont understand it theyll just be scarred for life by the damn horse adults were still scarred but by the meaning underneath fantastic movie
movies,not_removed,i was the same the scene at night when he sees it on top of the barn just watching scares me the most gave me chills just writing that
movies,not_removed,damn i remember watching this when i was younger alone on a day off from school and i had to actually shut the movie off after this scene because it freaked me out so much later my mom came home and we finished the movie after skipping that part though
movies,not_removed,the most frightening jump scare inducing scene every time that and when its on the barn fuck makes me tear up with anxiety just thinking about it
movies,not_removed,the movie is far from perfect but that scene is very well done and terrifying
movies,not_removed,spoiler spoiler
movies,not_removed,oh man im sorry i have to be the one to point this out
movies,not_removed,its not just the alien but its whole life cycle thats the kicker giger created this whole evolution which was born from his crazy but wonderful art and its fantastically realised it almost seems like a real possibility for an actual parasitic et even with all the iterations and rip offs theres nothing quite like it in movie history
movies,not_removed,same with me saw it in the theater was i dont remember which of my twisted uncles took me to it i feel a special relationship with that monster best nightmares ever
movies,not_removed,if you game at all i recommend playing alien isolation really nails the feel of the first film especially and gets your heart racing
movies,not_removed,i love the sound of the cracking wood
movies,not_removed,thx for the insight
movies,not_removed,that
movies,not_removed,right i bet there were a lot of pissed off parents who felt duped having spent money to bring their children to the theatre only to have to pay for bonus therapy later it was not a movie for kids but marketed as a colourful sequel and a fun romp for the whole family haha all lies
movies,not_removed,just hearing the soundtrack is enough to give me panic attack and i usually love watching horror movies
movies,not_removed,oh ya ill have to check it out i dont remember the movie being particularly good or bad just that it freaked me out
movies,not_removed,both some were repurposed klowns most were new creations for ernest
movies,not_removed,really wow thats cool he played kind of a douche but i can see him become as big as his dad hes got the chops
movies,not_removed,holy shit the entire time i was watching this episode i kept saying he looked just like kurt russell now i know
movies,not_removed,brilliant piece of trivia
movies,not_removed,i especially loved how they threw some sneaky videogame quotesreferences into this episode specifically how the voice in his ear tells him that he just needs to go up one more level to get out as well as using the phrase would you kindly
movies,not_removed,it was definitely the scariest episode yet
movies,not_removed,it probably didnt get as much praise because there wasnt much substance beneath its surface the other episodes were far more thought provoking and satirical of society especially men against fire
movies,not_removed,what about the mutant guy at the end
movies,not_removed,and hes getting better
movies,not_removed,giulio giones
movies,not_removed,the italian cousin
movies,not_removed,you eventually see patterns in the designs but they never stop being well made he really seems influenced by zdzislaw beksinski
movies,not_removed,each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around even under its wings day and night they never stop saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty who was and is and is to come revelation
movies,not_removed,the angels that ezekiel sees are described as such within it there were figures resembling four living beings and this was their appearance they had human form each of them had four faces and four wings their legs were straight and their feet were like a calfs hoof and they gleamed like burnished bronze so no del torros angel doesnt really look anything like a biblical angel neither do the angels that we commonly think of in pop culture mainly because angels look really fucking weird
movies,not_removed,bible i would guess
movies,not_removed,yep httpistackimgurcomdtmczjpg
movies,not_removed,i thought lynch himself said it wasnt about fatherhood but ive always thought the same as you
movies,not_removed,so is that entire bulk his body or is there some skeleton hiding inside all that fat thats actually him
movies,not_removed,didnt even realise that was stephen king for years n years
movies,not_removed,yeah if this movie ever comes up i always recommend watching it if you want to see a movie with almost no incest beastiality rape
movies,not_removed,i need an adult
movies,not_removed,if youve never at least seen the original alien film youre missing out isolations experience wouldve been even better i think
movies,not_removed,if you enjoyed isolation you would love the first alien it will put a lot of things into context too
movies,not_removed,i finally gave up on that game that game is pretty frustrating because the alien is so overpowered which does make it terrifying
movies,not_removed,oh mando yourself a favor and go watch alien and aliens right freaking now
movies,not_removed,what did i actually just watch
movies,not_removed,i remember seeing a review on imdb that summarized it like this alien revolves around horror aliens revolves around action alien revolves around drama and alien revolves around gore
movies,not_removed,joss whedon
movies,not_removed,you mean jean pierre juenet by style it follows the weirdness of city of lost children only more sexual and violent
movies,not_removed,its not fair to blame him at least not only him at all the direction on that movie is fucking terrible the tone and cinematography are all over the place its a disorienting film to watch the newborn that ended up in the film wasnt even his idea his idea of was of a much different far more alien alien so that whole scene wasnt even written by whedon there are actually little hints of really interesting stuff going on in that movie like the relationship between call and ripley and the best moment in the film imo where ripley burns all of her deformed and dying clones is really close to being fucking brilliant
movies,not_removed,that roar when told to stay behind and the second row of teeth over his tongue
movies,not_removed,i wouldve liked to see what transformation looked like
movies,not_removed,it was the claustrophobia tight crawlspaces etc that really got me
movies,not_removed,poop scoop malooop
movies,not_removed,i think they made a huge mistake in the us remake showing samaras face sadako is much more creepy cause you only see hair and one weird eye so you can only imagine how fucked up shes supposed to look like
movies,not_removed,theyll just be scarred for life by the damn horse am saw it as a kid can confirm
movies,not_removed,imagine watching it alone at night and on acres of land with the next house miles down the road not the bes decision on my part
movies,not_removed,yeh theres a few pics of the head with the top being seethrough showing the skull beneath it was basically hidden in the film though and i think it works better gigers designs were truly horrifying and unique
movies,not_removed,that is quite horrifying
movies,not_removed,i ve seen this clip a few times and i still jump every god dam time
movies,not_removed,book didnt have affleck plus points but the details in the book are way creepy
movies,not_removed,i hated his character at first but i loved him by the end thought he did a great job with it
movies,not_removed,i was wondering if would you kindly was an intentional reference it was only said once in a trivial way but it probably is
movies,not_removed,well shit ive missed would you kindly
movies,not_removed,i think its just because the provocative element has already been touched in white christmas not that its actually lacking however theres an underlying element that i believe to be quite profound and that is the observation of fear itself the idea of losing your mind is without a doubt much scarier than dying itself i think were all spoiled to how high caliber black mirror is because playtest is a rich episode the horror of it may be a factor too it definitely plays more like a scary movie than most episodes
movies,not_removed,i think the episode became very much about the character and his personal story with the scifi background as opposed to most other episodes where the characters stories kind of carry the episode specific message
movies,not_removed,this
movies,not_removed,dont say it
movies,not_removed,god damn thats creepy
movies,not_removed,there is another passage mentioned above that has a different type of angel described in revelation
movies,not_removed,this lovely thread made me tear up
movies,not_removed,like all art the interpretation is in the eye of the beholder when i became a dad that baby was all i could think about it was so strange being responsible for a baby i wasnt alone my wife was and still is with me helping but i cant help but feel like this whole thing is weird
movies,not_removed,has lynch definitively said its not about fatherhood i thought he only ever said that it wasnt purely about fatherhood so as to leave interpretation up to viewers
movies,not_removed,he was hobbled and then his bones from his legs femur were whittled into the tusks then he was shoved into the suit and sewed in as far as the bulk i imagine it was just some kind of filler inside the walrus skin suit like cotton or even animal blubber or something yeah that movie messed me up a bit when i saw it
movies,not_removed,he pops up in a lot of his movies or he did in the and always have fun looking for him i think creepshow was the last time he tried actually acting though
movies,not_removed,almost no incest beastiality rape man they got so close but it always just sneaks in there
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,id say alien and aliens are absolutely worth watching i can live without the rest of the franchise
movies,not_removed,would definitely give ripleys daughters story more meaning and context
movies,not_removed,the longest movie explanation of all time
movies,not_removed,i also love perlman and pinon and hedaya like its pretty well cast some interesting ideas but yeh its a fucking mess
movies,not_removed,agreed considering it was goo bacteria sperm squid trilobite
movies,not_removed,totally agree i still think the american version will and should go down as a horror classic but the japanese is superior in a lot of aspects
movies,not_removed,oh i feel you on that being pretty young when i saw it and knowing that it was filmed in my area creeped the fuck out of me
movies,not_removed,they are masterpieces also i heard that its a real human skull that was used within the alien costume but i couldnt find a source with a quick google to be fair with the eyes too they are only sockets and to quote the wikipedia article the alien possess no visible eyes though in the original alien film the top of the creatures head was translucent with empty humanlooking eye sockets within
movies,not_removed,the whole episode did a great job making him human he had nice traits and not so nice traits like all of us which makes the gutpunch of an ending work even better
movies,not_removed,his youthful selfishness along with his energy and enthusiasm made him seem like so many young people i know such a realistic character the episode wouldnt have worked anywhere near as well without him
movies,not_removed,it obviously was given the fact its a video game episode and the events that happen immediately after they say it
movies,not_removed,im under the impression that would you kindly isnt a terribly common way to ask someone to do something i hear would you please far more often
movies,not_removed,sonja has bioshock among the games on her shelf
movies,not_removed,ed
movies,not_removed,thats honestly one of the more normal looking descriptions of angels
movies,not_removed,the ones quoted above are most likely the archangels micheal gabriel raphael and uriel their full description is in the center around the throne were four living creatures and they were covered with eyes in front and in back the first living creature was like a lion the second was like an ox the third had a face like a man the fourth was like a flying eagle each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around even under its wings day and night they never stop saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty who was and is and is to come ezekiel probably didnt see archangels since they are the top in the hierarchy of angels and probably on take part in extremely important events like the apocalypse in revelations biblical angels tend to be described as part animal is an artist depiction of the one that is described like an eagle which is probably uriel
movies,not_removed,he has basically said that he has never encountered anyone who viewed the movie in line with how he intended it to be viewed in so many words
movies,not_removed,i was stupidly excited to randomly see him in sons of anarchy he played a creepy clean up guy and nailed it
movies,not_removed,i like to think that thing just had a ton of pheromones that took over adriens better instincts
movies,not_removed,they bring this feature back in alien isolation as well
movies,not_removed,i said dont say it goddamn im not going back to that place
movies,not_removed,just a summary ezekiel describes what god looks like guy made of glowing molten metal surrounded by rainbows and also the types of angels bearing his throne one kind that are made up of living wheels within wheels all ringed with eyes and the more traditional angels cherubim with wings and faces of an eagle of a lion of an ox and of a human looking in different directions in the book of genesis one of these also has a flaming sword
movies,not_removed,wow thats pretty metal molten metal if you will
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i didnt expect them to keep making these the joke was already stretched thin in the first one not that funny anymore imo
movies,not_removed,i honestly do not know why and how this script was approved it should have never been made well lets say you have the rights to the independence day franchise but you are creatively bankrupt you dont have the imagination to invest in the creative talents of other human beings because that would force you to invest speculatively but you have a sure income earner in your hands based on the strength of the first movie all you really need is some good cgi and some references to the first movie which audiences loved what do you do thats right you invest as little as possible in creative exploration or in the new script and pour your money into cgi and marketing then you kill yourself and go to hell where the devil uses you as a door mat
movies,not_removed,what were you expecting an oscar nominee they couldnt even talk will smith into reappearing will smith
movies,not_removed,no offense but it was pretty much exactly what i expected it to be look at the films roland emmerich made after the first independence day
movies,not_removed,this movie is going quietly into the night
movies,not_removed,i actually enjoyed the movie it wasnt a perfect movie but it was still oddly entertaining after hearing how bad it was before i saw it it was actually better than i expected it was cheesy but so was the original a guilty pleasure type of movie
movies,not_removed,your expectations were unrealistic in no way is this one of the most disappointing sequels
movies,not_removed,i have not as yet seen it but it has a disappointing rating on imdb and the comments are pretty much in agreement that it sucksi must say i am more than a little disappointed myself as i was looking forward to seeing it
movies,not_removed,needed more cliches
movies,not_removed,dissappointing what kind of high expectations did you have for that movie
movies,not_removed,well guys they hated john carter too and i think we all know how much of a sleeper that one is
movies,not_removed,i just got out of the theater from watching this movie ive gotta say while i see what youre saying i totally disagree the original movie was pretty cheesy and cliche too thats part of the feel of the movie this sequel hit all the right buttons and struck all the same chords as the first one i believe theres an effect of living with the enhanced memory of the original though i thought they did a good job of removing the older cast from the framework of the universe and setting up a new cast of people to further along the plot possibly in future movies in the franchise remember the original movie didnt have a whole lot of introduction to the characters either they managed to one up every single thing in the new movie the destruction the ships the weapons the aliens themselves and what the aliens were after in the first place spot fucking on sure the acting was campy but thats the type of movie it is thats what we want out of a feel good movie like this humans are awesome were awesome even if things look bad not everything is doomed because humanity has some pluck and were unique in the universe even though we have some faults its not a gritty dark hard hitting political or social commentary its a fun thrilling actionadventure feel good holiday movie where people blow up aliens i went in with pretty low expectations to he honest but i came out very excited about seeing the possibility of perhaps a tv series or at least another space based movie youre entitled to your opinion of course but this was hardly the worst sequel ever didnt you ever see grease
movies,not_removed,forget it jake its tinseltown edit god this sub really does lack a sense of humour
movies,not_removed,welcome to earfagain
movies,not_removed,ahh but of course thats why the transformers movies keep getting made
movies,not_removed,he wanted million apparently
movies,not_removed,he was being his usual pain in the ass self that hes been for the past few years now though you have to take anything hes doing with a grain of salt
movies,not_removed,i was expecting partial justification for wasting
movies,not_removed,we all have our own opinions thank you
movies,not_removed,this actually looks like a fun show to watch whos gonna talk better shop with an actor than another actor most of the time when you see an actor out of character theyre still doing a bit on whatever late night show theyre on promoting whatever project theyre not entirely proud of this feels more intimate and is maybe a chance for successful actors to provide an insight into a relatively unknown industry i like it then again its produced by variety so i dunno
movies,not_removed,imagination is the tool for writers in a world where we strive for equality and to find equality a lot of the time there is a limited resource that must be redistributed and shared differently to create equality imagination is one of the only things that is literally limitless this is an argument i have everytime a new bond film comes out its time for a female bond no it fucking is not it is time for a female agent to exist in to operate as her own agent as an equal asset to the agency as bond they should walk past one another on the way in and out of ms office as they are getting their respective missions and have a short exchange of banter with moneypenny she should have her own movie they should even have a crossover flick but she should not replace him to replace james with a female is not equality to give him an equal colleague is that is a product of imagination born of a true desire for equality and the same logic applies to race
movies,not_removed,what of the population is black again their representation in movies shouldnt be any higher
movies,not_removed,maybe black people should start making movies that arent about madea
movies,not_removed,viola hanks teaches tantric sex to ferrets on the weekends
movies,not_removed,loool how about making up for the fact that for years they got no representation why do white people get to be over represented without consequences or the fact that even when being represented its often in secondary roles
movies,not_removed,now thatsa spicy generalization
movies,not_removed,maybe black people tyler perry should start making movies that arent about madea hes tried but they just arent as successful
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,he didnt even mention the prolific ride along franchise
movies,not_removed,alist material a mustsee david fincher at his best
movies,not_removed,one of the best films of all time anyone who doesnt like it is not a person to be trusted
movies,not_removed,as honest as i can be when it first came out i knew nothing of it i got dragged to it thinking oh great pretty boy brad wants to play coppers it was a reminder that i quite liked him in twelve monkeys that saw me finally agree to go at first it all felt so damned pedestrian and clichéd some on the film seemed to agree with me as if you look it seems like even the fellow actors cringe when brad says ladies and gentlemen we have a homicide however what a radical change and upping of game with s the painting the message on the wall and the victim on the bed totally turned it around i was hooked and i would say its one of the greatest films of the mindful of the fact that the decade produced many many incredible films
movies,not_removed,kevin spacey at his finest even though hes not in the movie for a long time he nailed that super creepy fucked up character like spot on it gives me chills every time and nightmares of course
movies,not_removed,the title is fucking irritating sesevenen gawd
movies,not_removed,like the usual suspects i probably wouldve enjoyed it a lot more if i didnt have the spoilers culturally ingrained in me
movies,not_removed,it is a wonderful engaging disturbing film except the brad pitts acting at the very end
movies,not_removed,i thought it was obvious trite ugly a bit dumb and like watching the abominable dr phibes drained of its comedy but thats just me
movies,not_removed,youre irritating
movies,not_removed,so you must hate movies books and basically any story in general
movies,not_removed,really thats quite a leap but utterly wrong
movies,not_removed,all the words used to describe are typical letspickafight words by people who have unreasonable opinions
movies,not_removed,my opinion however is well reasoned and i have no trouble defending it and theres no cause for you to act like im attacking you personally or anyone else who happened to like the movie i was careful to couch everything i said as mere opinion youre arguing as if you thought i was describing your mother instead of how i felt about a grim silly movie
movies,not_removed,omg feminists would go insane if they didnt know what this is from
movies,not_removed,this has been posted so many times
movies,not_removed,still more better than another superhero post
movies,not_removed,lol read that in macs voice
movies,not_removed,exactly this guy gets it
movies,not_removed,two wrongs dont make a right
movies,not_removed,look man we all want mike myers to come back to acting but it doesnt seem to be happening also unless eddie murphy can be the bad guya few other characters in austin powers there is no mother movie id watch where they are both playing multiple characters
movies,not_removed,could it be a sequel to bowfinger
movies,not_removed,my favourite mike myers movie where he plays multiple roles is so i married an axe murder he plays the stuart mackenzie charlies main role father he has this bit where he is watching tv and theres a boy with a giant head head move if youve seen that movie youll know what im talking about if you havent seen it i recommend checking it out my favourite eddie murphy movie where he plays multiple roles is coming to america there is this barber shop and he plays people saul clarence and randy it is awesome and truely one of his best performances although the movies you mentioned are ok these movies were better imo
movies,not_removed,any thoughts yes youve made me consider watching pluto nash for some reason
movies,not_removed,i dont want to watch them do that by themselves let alone together
movies,not_removed,shrek and donkey in a movie together
movies,not_removed,yeah i agree hes probably not coming back i just think this scenario would be funny
movies,not_removed,or an actual chubby rain
movies,not_removed,coming to america end credits blew me away the first time i saw it
movies,not_removed,dont do it
movies,not_removed,i agree with the other guy eddy murphy is awesome but not even he could save that travesty
movies,not_removed,i mean in person not voices but yes shrek and donkey in a movie together in person
movies,not_removed,dont do it whatevs — im already preordering deathrace
movies,not_removed,live action shrek
movies,not_removed,dont they do that in theatres
movies,not_removed,these are terrible choices
movies,not_removed,i think youre overestimating how many billionaires there are
movies,not_removed,its almost like there are just less people in general watching tv conventionally
movies,not_removed,this is why there was a mistake you give best picture to a nonwhite film in the current climate you want as many people as possible to know since awards are boring they needed a way to make the awards front page news for a day or so a mistake of this magnitude was a good approach
movies,not_removed,wish i could give you more upvotes for title hit the nail on the head with me i could care less what rich peoples opinion of other rich people is if they want to dress it up with a little statue and televise it for more ad revenue go ahead but ive never been interested i have the same opinion of professional sports they are all overpaid entertainers that serve as nothing more than a distraction at least a few of them realize it and do something more useful with their money than buying frivolous garbage to makes the commoners envious
movies,not_removed,you are right actually

movies,not_removed,beast of the southern wild it was about the people that live in the marsh lands in louisiana after katrina happened it brings attention to the people that still live there but the film was just a bit too weird for me i thought i was trying to understand their struggle of living in such hard situations while not trying to give up who they were and all of the sudden monsters i was thoroughly confused i couldnt understand if these monsters were metaphorical or real to them or both i enjoyed the film up to that point and then couldnt understand what was going on i watched this in a college course about american directors we were given different prompts for each film for this film we were supposed to talk about the monsters and what they represent or whether they were real i was so confused that was definitely my skipped essay edit words
movies,not_removed,chemical wedding people being pissed on the beating up of a homeless person a jizzfax and to this day i dont understand the ending although i watched it three times in which freakin dimension were they
movies,not_removed,vanilla sky or black swan its a toss up
movies,not_removed,enemythat spider seriously wtf
movies,not_removed,enter the void
movies,not_removed,the red spectacles weird shit yo
movies,not_removed,one missed call
movies,not_removed,the strange color of your bodys tears
movies,not_removed,fateful findings
movies,not_removed,i wouldnt say the most but sword of doom always left me saying whatwhy
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,survive style
movies,not_removed,mulholland drive no idea what was going on in that movie maybe it was a lot of symbolism that i missed
movies,not_removed,revolver
movies,not_removed,last year at marienbad it is an absolutely amazing and stunning movie but it is also really weird and confusing at least movies like mulholland drive have moments of comprehension last year at marienbad have none
movies,not_removed,twilight in each scene i grew more and more baffled that people enjoyed it even though it seemed to have no redeeming value
movies,not_removed,either eden log or revolver
movies,not_removed,yakuza apocalypse
movies,not_removed,the matrix i still dont understand
movies,not_removed,primer
movies,not_removed,the navigator a medieval odyssey my dad thought it was supposed to be like flight of the navigator it wasnt
movies,not_removed,couldnt really say seen so many but some i have not seen mentioned fire walk with me yeah it was somewhat straightforward but a lot of weird shit in it that you cant clearly map to everything else especially if you were new to the universe another earth again mostly upfront but still a little puzzling and that ending how i live now really really simple story that wont leave you scratching your head probably but a lot of unanswered questions and imho one of the best scenes i have ever seen in a movie attack of the killer tomatoes i dont fucking know how did the tomatoes kill people why did sound bother them and how could they read musical notes i dont want to live in that universe
movies,not_removed,the box i love the concept but i was so lost the whole time
movies,not_removed,clout atlas
movies,not_removed,enemy was very confusing
movies,not_removed,southland tales
movies,not_removed,id probably say southland tales if that counts mainly for the subplots that either go nowhere or are forgotten entirely and the awkward dialogue such as deep down everyone wants to be a porn star scientists are saying the future is going to be far more futuristic than they originally predicted ladies and gentlemen this is the way the world ends not with a whimper but with a bang but there is hope in the end we can be reassured by one undeniable truth nobody rocks the cock like krysta now if you dont let me suck your dick im going to kill myself join us for an indepth discussion of the penetrating issues facing society today issues like abortion terrorism crime poverty social reform quantum teleportation teen horniness and war there is no stopping what cant be stopped only god can stop it but the new york times said god is dead what did we do when we discovered a rift in the fourth dimension we threw monkeys into it i am a pimp and pimps dont commit suicide
movies,not_removed,rubber
movies,not_removed,primer i tried to watch it again and ive read charts watched videos etc on how it really makes sense but you know what it really doesnt make any sense to me it was just all over the shop but i guess if i could time travel itd be that fucking mental too
movies,not_removed,coherence was a bit confusing in the sense that you lost track of who was who
movies,not_removed,definitely the cremaster series
movies,not_removed,cloud atlas
movies,not_removed,adaptation it was confusing in the sense that some parts were difficult to follow but also in the more general way of why is this a movie what makes this a story worth telling or hearing why are these characters worth knowing about
movies,not_removed,eyes wide shut i understood it or at least i think i did but it was probably the weirdest ive watched from hollywood at least
movies,not_removed,anything made by ben wheately highrise being the exception
movies,not_removed,red state
movies,not_removed,interstellar had me at one point where i felt i wasnt educated enough to understand what was happening
movies,not_removed,last year in marienbad
movies,not_removed,upstream color i had no idea what was going on
movies,not_removed,frenemy
movies,not_removed,southbound or vhs
movies,not_removed,upstream color
movies,not_removed,the piano tuner of earthquakes
movies,not_removed,synecdoche new york comes to mind
movies,not_removed,birdman i only saw it once and didnt really understand it or even like it
movies,not_removed,most of david lynches work
movies,not_removed,cloud atlas i loved the movie by man it was confusing
movies,not_removed,inland empire
movies,not_removed,definitely enter the void i watched it last year and i still dont understand what i watched ending was so baffling and entire movie is shot in very unusual way its not like any movie ive ever seen
movies,not_removed,shortbus
movies,not_removed,a recent one is the lobster i left having no opinion on it other than i liked it
movies,not_removed,fucking valhalla rising
movies,not_removed,eraserhead is up there but there are just so many i think of the more surreal ones takes the cake
movies,not_removed,donnie darko
movies,not_removed,read the book and watched the film and i still only a here a basic idea of the message plot characters and world it was a really heavy book to read and a boring and confusing movie
movies,not_removed,end of evangelion is seemingly confusing until you realize its a criticism about the isolation otaku culture encourages
movies,not_removed,interstellar really enjoyed it until the conclusion left me scratching my head and asking wtf
movies,not_removed,mulholland drive
movies,not_removed,the phantom menace
movies,not_removed,afterschool with a young ezra miller
movies,not_removed,donnie darko i still dont get it
movies,not_removed,inland empire
movies,not_removed,cloud atlas its like the director wanted to make movies but only had the budget for also hugo weaving hugo weaving everywhere
movies,not_removed,blue velvet
movies,not_removed,spartacus i have seen that movie half a dozen times and i still dont know who the real spartacus is and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit
movies,not_removed,snowpiercer was one movie that had me shaking my head the main plot was easy enough to follow but everything else in the movie just seemed to me like it was trying way to hard to be deep and important
movies,not_removed,i usually seek out movies that are confusing head scratching and then read about them afterword if i cant figure it out some recent ones trance the danny boyle film this wasnt confusing in a good way the twists kept coming and coming and were poorly introduced and explained i thought it would be like inception but it was just really confusing and dumb twists are meaningless if you dont explain them properly enough for the audience to actually be surprised i usually enjoy reading interpretations of films online but after this one i started reading and them realized i wasnt invested in the film or cared enough to actually read anything spoilers for being john malkovich spoilers i understood the themes but the plot confused me a bit i get that you can stay longer but did the whole group at the end enter his body they all seemed like they were planning on entering but i dont understand if they did also so was the main character who i hated stuck in his girlfriends stomach watching them raise a child why didnt he become the baby and instead was viewing them at the pool from her stomach i might have been confused because i was pretty sleepy when i saw it but i didnt understand the mechanics of the system and didnt get where the characters ended up end of spoilers for being john malkovich the thirteenth floor plot wise some spoilers for the thirteenth floor confused me with the constant switching between the different version of the people end of spoilers for the thirteen floor inland empire until i read something on here that made alot of sense you can usually find some underlying themes in lynchs films there is meaning like in eraserhead he is showing a man struggling to settle down i suggest red letter medias review as a fun discussion of their interpretation and some things about the film the thing is he uses abstract images and ideas in order to convey a message and instead of explaining things he allows them to be open because what is more important is how they make you feel what exactly happens isnt as important as the reaction you get from them he thrives on this some scences are just symbolism for the themes or messages he is wanting you to think about and tools for how he wants to make you feel syndoche new york made me feel lost with the reality of the film some spoilers for syndoche spoilers did the world end at the end not that it was important it was more that he world was ending the numerous actors playing the characters of the play within the movie then they started playing the characters of the film itself and then they had relationships with each other and their real people there were so many characters i had to really pay close attention to who was who and their relationship to each often theres way more but thats all i can thing of right now
movies,not_removed,synecdoche new york for sure
movies,not_removed,itt surrealist films that are meant to be up to your interpretation
movies,not_removed,hail caesar was a complete fucking mess but i could finish it and felt kind of entertained like i retained something from that movie inherent vice is the only movie i can think of that i couldnt finish because it was too confusing there was a good movie in there somewhere but it needed to be both shorter and longer somehow that movie had passion in it
movies,not_removed,southland tales was pretty weird starring the rock and sean william scott
movies,not_removed,the matrix trilogy was a good type of confusing followed by around two weeks of pondering to understand well enough what happened
movies,not_removed,i was pretty confused by donnie darko at the time i should see that movie again
movies,not_removed,stalker i love tarkovski but man did he made some weird ass movies
movies,not_removed,anything by wes anderson im not confused by plot i just scratch my head wondering at which part im supposed to be entertained
movies,not_removed,interstellar by far is the movie that confuses me the most because of the theory of relativity and then all of a sudden they introduce the fifth dimension or some sentient beings into the mix its just too much for me to handle
movies,not_removed,the da vinci code not in a good way
movies,not_removed,nolans and last movies come to mind memento and interstellar
movies,not_removed,the prestige is it his clone or just a double
movies,not_removed,inception
movies,not_removed,i cant believe no one has said the room yet so many questions most of them variations of why
movies,not_removed,eraserhead what the hell was that
movies,not_removed,movies that are also good maybe not totally mindfuck but the aforementioned primer also mulholland drive holy rollers memento the game the prestige being john malkovich the truman show donnie darko and inception
movies,not_removed,for me it is gone girl
movies,not_removed,i am still baffled why anyone thought making a movie from twilight was a good idea
movies,not_removed,the thing with donnie darko is that it shouldnt have been confusing the plot is very straightforward it just intentionally leaves out details to make the plot seem deeper than it really is you should not have to read a book or look online to understand a simple movie like that its poorly done and in my opinion one of the most overrated movies of all time
movies,not_removed,predestination
movies,not_removed,inception i watched it a couple of times to know what the hell was going on
movies,not_removed,grown ups who thought it was a good idea to make a second one
movies,not_removed,finding nemo did they ever find him scratches head
movies,not_removed,carnosaur movie was so confusing that i still can even what the hmmm
movies,not_removed,the fountain severely underrated
movies,not_removed,interstellar for me rewatched it just to understand what it was all about movies is hours long though
movies,not_removed,mr nobody anyone
movies,not_removed,angel heart
movies,not_removed,a space odyssey the opening to the trippy ending killed me
movies,not_removed,i had to watch inception again and again to fully understand it
movies,not_removed,gone girl hands down
movies,not_removed,snow piercer
movies,not_removed,any movie writtendirected by christopher nolan
movies,not_removed,does my disagreement count if ive watched this specifically as a lynch movie if you are familiar with his work then it actually makes sense you just need to catch that one sentence before shit gets weird and you will sleep so he does he sleeps and what we see from then on is how he wants to remember things stated in the movie too something along the lines i like to remember things my way spoiler so to me it meant he couldnt accept what happened and decided to remember it differently in reailty if there is such a thing in that movie fred killed laurent and thus he was set up by laurents allies who killed his wife too
movies,not_removed,this movie is insane
movies,not_removed,this needs to be higher up
movies,not_removed,true but i still loved it its part of the beauty of a great lynch film and that scene where robert blake approaches bill pullman at the party tells him hes at his house and bill callschilling
movies,not_removed,now give me back my phone
movies,not_removed,laptop abuse intensifies
movies,not_removed,i havent been writing my novel
movies,not_removed,i watched this movie for the second time today and i still have no idea if breen is supposed to be a good guy a bad guy an anti hero or a bad guy who finds redemption or what hes just a paranoid crazy guy who kills some people and eats tuna and cures brain cancer
movies,not_removed,i dont see what is so confusing about it rich evans explains it accurately
movies,not_removed,did you jump at that ending i jumped at that ending
movies,not_removed,i still dont understand
movies,not_removed,im beyond excited for villineuves blade runner prisoners is amazing too
movies,not_removed,would you recommend watching it
movies,not_removed,well its subjective so i think you still might not understand
movies,not_removed,that is one headache inducing film
movies,not_removed,my favourite film of all time i absolutely love the themes and the cinematography
movies,not_removed,i fell asleep watching it in the theatre when i woke up i felt like i was still on the same level of knowing as everyone around me
movies,not_removed,iirc studio interference is the biggest thing the wachowskis wanted it to be the first film in a trilogy and they wanted it to be four hours long but the studio butchered the cut and demanded a resolved ending the result was a particularly confusing film that pinballed between different tones and plotpoints the studio also seemingly tried to prevent people from noticing the obvious plot inspiration its a scifi adaptation of snow white
movies,not_removed,that movie is strange to me some of the visuals are incredible and then some of the cgi looks like a made for tv movie
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,flying rollerskates
movies,not_removed,absolutely what was it a metaphor for the fear of parenthood a bad dream
movies,not_removed,i was really confused when i first saw it but i understood it better on my second viewing i think its overall about a mans fear of being a father that being said i still dont understand a lot of the imagery
movies,not_removed,i really want to finish this movie but i cant get past the chicken scene when the mom starts moaning it was too weird for me
movies,not_removed,it does have a linear story that makes sense its brilliantly done have you seeninland empire
movies,not_removed,came here just to lament not being the first to say this this and chinatown chinatown took me three viewings with a notepad and a specific purpose of figuring out the entire plot to answer a number of arguments but ive seen mulholland drive twice and still dont quite get if lynch really has a single intent he likes to just be weird for the sake of being weird the only really weird thing about chinatown is that the final scene and its most famous line werent even written by the guy who won the oscar for writing the movie
movies,not_removed,care to elaborate
movies,not_removed,i watched this movie like years ago and the only thing i remember from it is that creepy bum scene
movies,not_removed,a lot of people tend to jump to the defense of lynch films like this or lost highway saying that these films arent confusing i got it the first time i saw it total bullshit no one has ever fully understood these films upon first viewing they are a goddamn rubiks cube and take many viewings to decipher and most of the time you will still have to look up what shit means not a bad thing but it annoys me when people try to act cool by saying youre dumb for not getting that right off
movies,not_removed,el topo too its reaaally weird but really interesting
movies,not_removed,right i love david lynch but dune was so shitty
movies,not_removed,if you study hermetic alchemy or theosophy at all the holy mountain starts to make a whole lot more sense its definitely a headscratcher in that its using an obscure symbolic system and a thorough one at that that said the more you know about alchemy theosophy etc the more the holy mountain makes sense
movies,not_removed,have you seen the version that was the same movie but with footage of dogs instead
movies,not_removed,watched it on some strong edibles and it was like a fantastic yet utterly nonsense dream and has one of my favorites fuck it were done here endings ever
movies,not_removed,i will definitely look into it
movies,not_removed,who needs the typical narrative structure anyways ¯ツ¯
movies,not_removed,i only saw half of it i just kept thinking whats he doing and why
movies,not_removed,i felt that its leos caraxs tribute to film the opening scene is carax taking over the film real at the theatre and putting on his movie which is a string of most genres of film all portrayed by oscar the actor oscar cannot die and can do nearly anything because he does not live in the real world rather the cinematic world that carax loves the range of human emotion namely love loss infatuation sadness show that carax appreciates where film can bring you how it can make you feel or react one of the great scenes is the death bed sequences where it become clear that everyone involved is playing a roll it asks the viewer if we are all not performers in a sense it also suggests that the way movies inspire us and make us feel powerfully are just a thin step away from the world we live in other parts namely the eva mendez part with the troll the part with the stabbing and the video motion scenes all push that notion away and show the viewer darker less verbal aspects of film how without words theres still a communication between the filmmaker and viewer thats palatable even if its moving away from verisimilitude just my two cents
movies,not_removed,holy motors is one of my favorite films
movies,not_removed,i refuse to accept that that movie makes sense to anyone anyone that says it makes sense is deliberately lying to make fun of how lost i specifically was after watching
movies,not_removed,i saw it and had a bit of an understanding of what happened then i looked at of events and was confused as hell
movies,not_removed,i felt the confusing nature of primer was fairly deliberate as the main characters are going through the same thing as they figure out the bizarre implications if their device
movies,not_removed,would you recommend watching it
movies,not_removed,had to see it at least three times before i started to understand what happened in the end good movie though
movies,not_removed,i had no idea what i just saw but it was pretty good geoquake self entitled film critic
movies,not_removed,yep its a decent enough film but it does not work very well its not clear enough sure they made it trying to be clever but the fact it left most people cold makes it not such a great film as some say
movies,not_removed,the change of actors between riggs and muratugh in the middle of the movie really threw me off
movies,not_removed,yeah i could never really get into this movie im a huge fan of aronofsky hes one of my favorite filmmakers but i just had a hard time getting into this one and it left me cold perhaps that was the point its not bad though and has an eerie vibe to it
movies,not_removed,agreed but overall i think you dont need to choose in which story do you believe the point of the movie is that its okay to believe in multiple things at the same time
movies,not_removed,i can think of two things wrong with that title givemekarma
movies,not_removed,i still have no idea what was going on in that movie
movies,not_removed,when watching it it reminded me a ton of fight club even to the point of that penis being inserted in a random frame
movies,not_removed,agreed it was very well made but i had to do some research after watching it because i was very confused o
movies,not_removed,i saw this and thought that it was trying a little too hard to be weird for its own sake not in a bad way but a little noticeable
movies,not_removed,dont forget the justin timberlake music video
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,it was a horrible movie
movies,not_removed,tetsuo the iron man
movies,not_removed,i had a bad feeling about joe dirt when it was originally released as a crackle exclusive fucking crackle
movies,not_removed,what i dont understand is why they had to make it a time travel movie when i heard there was going to be a sequel i immediately thought the movie was going to be about him finding his sister it probably would have been way better and made much more sense
movies,not_removed,the for me at least have been the decade of disappointing sequels to beloved comedies joe dirt is just another one on the pile
movies,not_removed,was looking for upstream color here thanks i thought i was the only one who was left scratching his head after that one my friend and i saw it as an allegory to schizophrenia only to then go into the netz and find out we were absolutely wrong about it and the real story was even more out there than we thought
movies,not_removed,i didnt i hated it but enjoyed primer
movies,not_removed,i love kubrick but i think he let too much up to interpretation in this one for instance the space stations being nuclear weapons was a major plot point but he didnt give the viewer any clues at all thats what they were i only found that out after googling after seeing it
movies,not_removed,i dont tend to advocate being made to read the book to make sense of the movie but in the case of its a good idea really explains a lot of what happened while still maintaining a sense of awe and wonder at what could be out in the universe as a counterpoint the book and movie were made simultaneously so the stories technically arent the same but the only real difference is that the book has them go to jupiter though this is retconned in the books sequels
movies,not_removed,i love that movie i think its about viewing your ego as a separate entity that tries to control you in order to grow you have to kill your ego a lot of similar ideas can be found in chuck palahniuk books you have to destroy yourself in order to find or save yourself
movies,not_removed,im actually from the town its set in and i was both lost and confused with that film
movies,not_removed,i liked gummo it was about white trash kids getting into the trouble that white trash kids get into
movies,not_removed,love that movie the ending is fantastic
movies,not_removed,i mean really its just the longest music video ever made
movies,not_removed,the lobster was very different than what i expected but i really liked it
movies,not_removed,inherent vice is about the death of counterculture in the by profiteering businesses the introduction of heroin and time theres more i could write on the subject but its pretty much all summed up by the explanation of what inherent vice is inherent vice is an assumed loss because the items are built on unstable components all the movements of the hippies bikers etc are amalgamated into a part of this big system the golden fang that ends up being a huge group of heroin pushers on different levels the decade is inherent vice and docs just there to investigate all the things that led to its loss its actually really brilliant one of my favorite pt anderson films im surprised it wasnt more well recieved
movies,not_removed,yup i had to read the wikipedia synopsis to make sense of the fountain
movies,not_removed,the fountain should be higher up ive watched it like times and read wikipedia synopses and still cant make sense of it
movies,not_removed,i remember jerking off to rose mcgowan in that movie as a child
movies,not_removed,well you tried
movies,not_removed,the movie was about the characters who had done wrong given the oppurtunity to redeem their souls in their reincarnated lives it also showed karma catching up to those who had done wrong in previous lives
movies,not_removed,did you two bond over the experience
movies,not_removed,try watching the directors cut that one explains everything in the form of chapters of the book donnie is reading the theatrical cut does leave you wondering how the heck to explain everything that happened
movies,not_removed,it is confusing but it helps if you consider that the movie about the need for human interaction even if you risk pain doing so its also a criticism of otaku culture and how it sort of encourages isolation
movies,not_removed,all of the events in the movie are possible scenarios resulting from the decision young nemo faces at the train station with his parents he sees all of the possibilities making it even harder for him to decide
movies,not_removed,i second this seen it times and just end up more confused than the last time i watched it still good tho
movies,not_removed,is it really confusing though i cant see what plot point people would be confused about
movies,not_removed,the difference in hype levels between seeing the promo wayland ted talk and seeing the movie is like a vertical sheer cliff
movies,not_removed,i couldnt get over the part when the scientists made several stupid decisions in the movie why would a scientist treat an alien snake like creature like a garden caterpillar
movies,not_removed,absolutely loved the ending the last minutes were awesome
movies,not_removed,man did i dislike this movie every now and again i run into a movie where im asking myself why was this thing made every moment more is just that much extra that i cant stand to watch some seem to appreciate it but beasts of the southern wild is not something i will ever watch again
movies,not_removed,its a long visuallybeautiful poem the basic plot makes sense in the end i guess its just the way its delivered is weird also its available for free at archiveorg i think
movies,not_removed,i feel the same way
movies,not_removed,i felt like the premise was absurd as well corn crop failing dont fix that just build giant spaceships and send everybody through a wormhole to some distant hellhole
movies,not_removed,pushes up glasses technically nolans first movie was following
movies,not_removed,twin
movies,not_removed,ive watched it a few times great movie but it takes a few rewatches to get
movies,not_removed,gone girl wraps itself up pretty well theres no loose ends in it really
movies,not_removed,first of all how dare you
movies,not_removed,i remember the only time i watched it was because a friend was asking me to if they werent sitting next to me i would have given up earlier in the movie as i thought it was pretty terrible the end made the rest worth watching in hindsight
movies,not_removed,still confusing after they spend the entire ending overexplaining everything
movies,not_removed,they found themselves
movies,not_removed,i thought that ben affleck was pretty shit in the film not sure if it was just me though the film as a whole was really good
movies,not_removed,ill give you interstellar and inception because those take a couple of watches and some reading up to really get but the batman movies and the prestige were pretty self explanatory
movies,not_removed,that line you quote is one of my favorite film quotes not necessarily the way they happened
movies,not_removed,i agree its about remembering things the way he wanted to but i think its about a dying relationship with someone he loved
movies,not_removed,wrong neil been movie i think that one is fateful findings
movies,not_removed,hes not the good guy hes not the bad guy hes the guy honestly i literally just watched it its impossible to say it seems like he started of badish but his ghostskeletonwig in a body bag seems to have made him have a change of heart granted it seems to happen a few hours after the attack actually takes place but still
movies,not_removed,yeah haha i was like wtf even horror movies dont make me jump like that
movies,not_removed,stay indoors when giant spiders terrorize cities
movies,not_removed,he meets a twin in the book in the movie the twin could be himself in his past life that he forgot about but revisits he used to be an actor but became a teacher
movies,not_removed,yeah its pretty good jake gyllenhall is a really good but under appreciated actor its a good thriller but im not a fan of the ambiguous ending
movies,not_removed,my favorite film too i have seen it like times and still go back to it or times every year have you seen the the genius of synecdoche new york from yms is a great series explaining every single detail from the movie
movies,not_removed,the wachowskis wanted it to be the first film in a trilogy and they wanted it to be four hours long but the studio butchered the cut and demanded a resolved ending first if the watchowskis were planning a fourhour cut theyre incompotent you cant create a dollar movie and sell enough tickets with a movie thats that long the shorter the movie the more time slots you can create at the theater unless the movie has incredible booking power over other movies you simply cant have a good opening weekend if there arent enough seats to sell the watchowskis have a very questionable background and if they think they can just create a fourhour opener to a trilogy theyre dillusional yeah im sure every director wants their movie to be a trilogy second im tired of all the people blaming the studio for butchering cuts a director should be able to make a movie that has a fun ending and still encourages a followup i heard studioblaming nonstop for batman vs superman the studio didnt supply the wooden acting of henry cavill who i love in other films the nonsensical story of amy adams whos part could have been completely removed and it wouldnt have affected the story or the otherwise weak premise of the film getting the two to main characters to fight each other
movies,not_removed,im pretty sure they were forced to shove all three films or at least the first two into one which is why the movie seems to have two third acts jupiter being forced into marriage and channing tatum and sean bean trying to save her immediately followed by eddie redmayne kidnapping jupiters family you can sort of see why it ended up as mess if you shove three films into one
movies,not_removed,four hours you gotta be kidding me what were they gonna wait in the space dmv for longer being longer would not have saved that film thank god the studio got involved because i dont think i could handle sitting through four hours of mila kunis and channing tatums both of who i normally enjoy uncharismatic performances
movies,not_removed,fear of parenthood or just general fear of settling down and having responsibilities
movies,not_removed,yes fear of parenthood the girl in the radiator could be seen as hope or an escape from reality as the movie progresses we see more of her and less of reality hinting at possible suicide but its entirely open to interpretation
movies,not_removed,fear of parenthood and losing masculinity
movies,not_removed,though i havent seen the movie ive heard numerous theories about the former
movies,not_removed,david lynch could make a movie about breakfast cereal and i would love it
movies,not_removed,yeahhhh i have no idea what that scene was about o
movies,not_removed,it isnt linear though is it
movies,not_removed,inland empire fucked me up so much it made mulholland drive make sense
movies,not_removed,mulholland drive isnt weird for the sake of weird spoiler the first half of the movie is a dream that ends when the mysterious box opens the dream is lived through by a woman who had her lover killed you see this entire story in the second half of the movie in the dream the roles of the two women are swapped something that does happen in real dreams after this intense dream the woman can no longer handle the guilt of her actions and takes her own life mulholland drive is a brilliant beautiful movie that makes complete sense
movies,not_removed,he likes to just be weird for the sake of being weird lynch isnt weird for the sake of being weird hes interested in creating a tone and atmosphere that happens to be surreal
movies,not_removed,he likes to just be weird for the sake of being weird i get bummed out when i hear this i strongly suggest you find a place that explains the film and then watch it again i honestly believe you would change your mind about that
movies,not_removed,chinatown was a little hard to follow yes but you can get the gist of it mulholland drive kind of bothers me because it has some parts that pretty clearly serve little to no purpose but because its symbolism were supposed to pretend theyre important
movies,not_removed,to be fair theres film classes based entirely on studying the structure of that screenplay till this day people replicate the structure of that thing
movies,not_removed,lynch disowned dune because the studio took over the control
movies,not_removed,which cut actually they were all pretty weak
movies,not_removed,i still liked dune but it definitely had its obvious flaws
movies,not_removed,is there a place where these things are explained to me i love that film
movies,not_removed,the holy mountain
movies,not_removed,doubt is one i would recommend and it has probably one of the best casts in history
movies,not_removed,i had that same thought at the end of the movie
movies,not_removed,it does makes sense after you watch it a second time
movies,not_removed,i think the film becomes pretty easy to follow the moment you stop worrying about every possible timeline and just follow the trend instead of focusing on every minute possible detail allow the fuzziness of the plot to whelm you and instead of trying to focus on trees look at the forest and in doing so you have a general understanding of what is going its not crystal clear and thats a good thing and in doing so you realise the film isnt about time travel as cool as the mathematics and logic behind the technicality of the universe are and the time traveling is it isnt really interesting compared to focusing on the themes of the film people forget that ultimately the film isnt necessarily about time travel its allegorical take about what normal people do when given potentially immense power that may be too oawesome and what that does to relationships it harkens to myths about king midas and people who were seduced by power
movies,not_removed,heres an even less helpful but accurate flowchart
movies,not_removed,in most of these movies the confusion is deliberate but the reason why primer is my favorite movie is that there are realizations every step of the way hidden in the details and those realizations are dependant on each other and work backward from the ending you could watch primer dozens of times and still notice a new detail that gives away which iteration of each character they are
movies,not_removed,definitely it was entertaining if you like indie mindfuck movies
movies,not_removed,the creator wanted people to watch it at least twice he never expected people to get it all in one go
movies,not_removed,best use of blackface since tropic thunder though
movies,not_removed,what i have been able to get out of it is that the main character was so high on drugs he saw some weird creepy shit oh ya his wife was cheating on him too
movies,not_removed,the entire opening sequence was oddly terrifying and could have a whole analysis of its own separate from the rest of the movie
movies,not_removed,oh yeh also the sean william scott psychic twins like race to witch moutain but with the stiffmeister
movies,not_removed,try visitor q
movies,not_removed,wtf is crackle
movies,not_removed,and hours of that retarded time travel shit
movies,not_removed,i think this plot point is much clearer if you watch dr strangelove immediately before watching it never clicked for me before but when i watched strangelove followed by it immediately clicked
movies,not_removed,i love kubrick but i think he let too much up to interpretation in this one for instance the space stations being nuclear weapons was a major plot point but he didnt give the viewer any clues at all thats what they were i only found that out after googling after seeing it i never got that from the movie but i didnt find it particularly headscratching either after the third viewing i mean the first one had me going all wtf happened there at that ending but eventually i kind of got it
movies,not_removed,aka dmt
movies,not_removed,that film is dog shit
movies,not_removed,im haunted by memories of this film wtf was it
movies,not_removed,its good after watching it i read a bunch of fan theories on what actually went down in the ending i would like some input from the director but last i checked he was pretty quiet on the matter
movies,not_removed,i loved it such a weird but amazing idea
movies,not_removed,nothing about the movie pops nothing about it surprises you theres no charisma or charm or passion in that movie the only scene i can remember is the part with the asian prostitutes and the weird saxophone owen wilson shit i couldnt finish the movie
movies,not_removed,the only actual events are the modern day issues with tom the doctor and izzi the cancer patient the rest is a story started by izzi and finished by tom
movies,not_removed,how does he end up chinese though
movies,not_removed,theres a lot of little stuff that i dont get like the helicopters at the beach breaking the vases waking up in the weird town with the sweater vest the basic point of the movie is little nemo is playing out all of the possible scenarios that would follow from him going with his mom or his dad when they split up
movies,not_removed,in its defense it follows suit with the first alien movie i just watched that one and i cant believe the amount of mindnumbingly idiotic decisions that crew makes oh this guy got an alien lifeform stuck on his head so lets bring him to the ship guis and then lets operate on the goddamn face eating thing wearing no protection whatsoever because yolo also freezing the guy harboring a lifeform on his face no way lets let them live and see what happens its ridiculous really p
movies,not_removed,i guess it depends on how you look at it but to me it is not about making sense of it rather it is about getting immersed in this stunning and weird and dreamlike movie
movies,not_removed,i actually appreciated them not going too much into detail about the blight i liked how it was some problem they couldnt solve and didnt go too far into the science of it i dont think it would have really helped the story any having said that it was really confusing i was asking myself if they cant grow plants on earth anymore for whatever reason why go to another planet wont they be taking the blight with them how does this solve anything
movies,not_removed,i was under the impression they tried for many years and corn and a few other vegetables were the last holdouts im sure what was happening with the corn had already happened with other important crops so its something they have seen before and they know whats going to happen next
movies,not_removed,i stand corrected is it good
movies,not_removed,just look at the movies richard kelly made afterwards southland tales and the box donnie darko was a fluke it had some iconic scenes that really resonated with high school kids and they were tricked into thinking it was a good movie personal high school example admittedly anecdotal whats your favourite movie donnie darko whats it about i couldnt really understand it ummmm like it was like all a dream
movies,not_removed,the end is the worst part of the movie lol
movies,not_removed,yeah kind of i mean its not the easiest concept to wrap your head around
movies,not_removed,i kinda agree i think what makes it confusing and completely insane imo is the fact that amy the wife had everything planned out
movies,not_removed,inception was pretty self explanatory too much simpler than the prestige
movies,not_removed,if you notice he tells her he has something to do that night when he finds the key to that club in his envelope right before he runs into that spider he fell for temptation again at that club was that spider so she was kind of a manifestation of that failure to temptation again something like that haha
movies,not_removed,really i always thought the movie was out of order and its actually about a schizofrenic person living a double life how he cheats on his wife while he is his teacher persona his wife refers to a girl hes seeing again like it happend before its to much to get into in a comment but i remember reading something similar to this sentiment and i think it fits quite well wether or not this is the actual intent i dont know intruiging movie and of course that ending out of nowhere
movies,not_removed,im completely the same i dont think ill ever tire over that movie its definitely kaufmans best work and no i havent ill definitely check it out
movies,not_removed,i didnt blame studios for the bad editing in bvs i thought it was their fault that the final cut had so many unnecessary or inappropriate additions like the flash prophecy wonder woman the teaser videos and other things that glutted the movie avengers age of ultron had similar conflict between joss whedon and the executives over the thor futurevisions scene
movies,not_removed,studioexecutive blaming happens a lot but if the director is asking for something absolutely unreasonable no way in hell would any studio greenlight a runtime and becomes a dick about it then yeah the studio needs to step in
movies,not_removed,the watchowskis theyre incompotent ftfy
movies,not_removed,but at the end i suppose but most of it is
movies,not_removed,this exactly
movies,not_removed,by definition lynch is an experimental artist a brilliant one at that and mulholland drive was originally going to be a tv show the film you watch by the same title is the pilot mixed with other future scenes edited together into its own form under the circumstances
movies,not_removed,i get the picture more than i let on i just dont think it connects properly and i wonder if theres just something i missed because its just too buried i dont remember the details of why i do remember thinking he was laying it on thick eraserhead twin peaks blue velvet the dude is into weirding people out
movies,not_removed,he always say when the movie sucks
movies,not_removed,what in the hell did i just watch i tried to follow but there was no way
movies,not_removed,ya that may be the weirdest thing ive ever seen
movies,not_removed,thats really it isnt it i would never be able to put it into words like that but thats pretty much the takeaway you cant follow what happens or why but you can see what the characters were doing to each other and it gets really revealing when you consider who some of them are in that way its more subtle and realistic than any other movie ive seen
movies,not_removed,httpimgsxkcdcomcomicsmovienarrativechartspng title movie narrative charts titletext in the lotr map up and down correspond loosely to northwest and southeast respectively stats this comic has been referenced times representing of referenced xkcds httpswwwxkcdcom httpswwwredditcomrxkcd httpswwwredditcomrxkcdtranscriber httpxkcdrefinfostatistics
movies,not_removed,also one of the most impressive indie films in terms of production quality you can tell it was made on a budget but it still looks like a professional movie and has great cinematography
movies,not_removed,yeah thats fine but if thats the case maybe it would help if it had characters you could relate to or a plot that wasnt so needlessly complicated its not that good enough a film to warrant so many views imo
movies,not_removed,true and frank reynolds plays an excellent villain
movies,not_removed,there was like a minute documentary just on the opening minutes on the blu ray i loved this movie but it didnt make much sense to me the first time i saw it
movies,not_removed,oh god
movies,not_removed,its that thing that goes right after snap but right before pop
movies,not_removed,exactly
movies,not_removed,modern day version of straight to dvd
movies,not_removed,its a free movie and tv showstreaming service its like a really low quality netflix but its free crackle used to be the only streaming service that had seinfeld but now you can get all the episodes on hulu
movies,not_removed,its visually incredible though
movies,not_removed,so im assuming the space tom is the part of the story tom finished
movies,not_removed,figured the blight was the result of some sort of global event that changed the atmosphere like a nuclear war i also thought perhaps the sun underwent a rapid change and instead of feeding the plants whatever energy it was now releasing was harmful to them maybe if it was also hotter then some sort of crop eating insects like locusts could have mutated into a superbug or maybe there is jusr way too many of them i dont remember but did they ever say the blight was like a plant disease i cant remember but if they did then im wrong
movies,not_removed,most people dont appreciate the fact that we evolved to live on earth not just any spherical planet sized blob in space that gravity would make us stick to as difficult as it may have gotten to crow food here the chances of finding another planet at the other end of a wormhole that could have ever grown anything at all would be infinitesimal
movies,not_removed,its a great film very inspired by hitchcock
movies,not_removed,the plot isnt what makes donnie darko though theres great performances great dialog great music amazing visuals the plot is the obvious weak point
movies,not_removed,i thought it was the visual representation of someones mind he wants to be an actor who his faithful to his wife but is a cheating teacher at the end he goes from cheating teacher to faithful actor but when his wife turns into a spider he realizes that it is pointless and he will cheat again
movies,not_removed,that doesnt make sense the car accident is where he got insane and forgot who he was it was after that his wife left him because he wasnt himself anymore
movies,not_removed,i may be in the minority here but i loved bvs but i have only seen the ultimate edition which most people say is far better than the theatrical cut but the flash prophecy was stupid out of line with the story and completely unnecessary
movies,not_removed,wachowski incompetent since were nitpicking i mean
movies,not_removed,no youre thinking of richard kelly
movies,not_removed,weird for the sake of like art dude
movies,not_removed,thats like saying bill murray is funny for the sake of being funny or cameron diaz is hot for the sake of being hot
movies,not_removed,i mean hasnt he proven himself otherwise maybe he does know what hes doing
movies,not_removed,i believe the original question was out of curiosity what is the most confusing head scratching movie you have ever seen
movies,not_removed,if you thought the trailer was baffling watch the full film its pretty dang beautiful in its own rite a lot of disturbing stuff but its quite an amazing atmosphere it creates
movies,not_removed,despite the holy mountains fantastic imagery its actually a straightforward movie about spiritual awakening
movies,not_removed,honestly i think the trailer makes more sense than the full film itself if you do plan on watching which i would highly recommend a certain influence adds to the fun if youre into that kind of thing
movies,not_removed,the complicated plot is the whole point of the movie
movies,not_removed,yes that was his catharsis imagining taking izzi the tree to xibalba the afterlife
movies,not_removed,the chances would small or nonexistent if it was just a random outing however the wormhole in the movie was specifically placed there to take them to those specific planets by the future humans
movies,not_removed,i agree with the great music and visuals some of the performances werent bad either i guess im focusing on the plot because that is what makes the movie so unique there is an intentionally convoluted narrative that cheapens the experience it was a conscious choice made by the writerdirector that throws me off anyway im glad you liked it the movie just doesnt sit well with me like i said there definitely is some iconic scenesvisuals there that obviously people dug but it reminds me of recent guy ritchie films or hipster coffee shops caked on aesthetic over a hollow shell there are just way better movies that do the donnie darko thing better than donnie darko to name a few all my own opinion of course completely subjective cheers
movies,not_removed,i like this ill keep it in mind when viewing it again
movies,not_removed,thats what i mean when i say nothing in the movie is in order the scenes arent chronological but honestly its been so long since ive seen it i could just be talking out of my ass right now maybe nows a good time to rewatch it
movies,not_removed,i will look up who richard kelly is so as to be sure im not thinking of him edit looked him up ive only seen donnie darko but that weirdness was trying to create an illusion of depth
movies,not_removed,confusion that brings transcendental bliss neat scraching the surface p
movies,not_removed,then that is not a great idea if you want people to watch it which it is so it failed from the get go i have no problems with primer apart from it took itself too seriously and failed as a coherent film because of it you can be clever and fuck up
movies,not_removed,to be fair a lot of movies are not in complete chronological order they often have flashbacks
movies,not_removed,but that weirdness was trying to create an illusion of depth based off some of the interviews kelly has said about the movie it doesnt seem like he was trying to create some sort of illusion
movies,not_removed,personally i think it would be quite bad of the franchise to kill him and han off in back to back films
movies,not_removed,he was complaining about the beard on twitter at one point so its pretty natural he would shave it off afterward since he didnt like it theres plenty of time till episode ix starts filming to grow it back so thats not really an issue this does however seem to imply that he wont be doing reshoots for viii which means rian johnson is pretty fucking confident with the material which he has right now which is probably a good thing
movies,not_removed,most movies the actors either grow very short beardscruff or go all out fx make up beards its rare to see true beards especially longer ones in movie and television productions just try to find any show with a character in possession on two years unbridled growth 😁
movies,not_removed,he shaved it after he filmed vii as well and then started growing it out again months later
movies,not_removed,maybe luke gets out of his melancholic rut and goes back to freshly shaven luke and starts wrecking shit
movies,not_removed,xdfhdffhd
movies,not_removed,is an excellent ghost story with a twist
movies,not_removed,audition creepy as fuck
movies,not_removed,its not really horrific but i rank something wicked this way comes as a really great halloween movie the script was adapted from a story by ray bradbury is a lyrically eloquent depiction of what it meant to be a boy growing up in small town usa about a hundred years ago its family friendly but theres one scene involving a lot of spiders that arachnophobia sufferers may wish to preview ill be watching it with my son tomorrow 😀
movies,not_removed,the devils backbone guillermo del toro the descent neil marshall let the right one in tomas alfredson drag me to hell sam raimi trollhunter andre ovredal oculus mike flanagan
movies,not_removed,behind the mask the rise of leslie vernon i wouldnt say it was truly scary but it was a good under the radar slasher flick
movies,not_removed,bug is pretty unnerving
movies,not_removed,grave encounters lake mungo the taking of deborah logan transformers trollhunter youre next creep a girl walks home alone at midnight
movies,not_removed,the grudge i watched it for the first time alone in my apartment in the dark never again
movies,not_removed,fantastic four
movies,not_removed,ive never seen a scary horror movie personally but santa sangre was very good
movies,not_removed,i strongly suggest this id say probably less scares than you might be used to but the atmosphere is fantastic and what is there is pretty effective
movies,not_removed,also worth mentioning that despite starting out as what seems like a romcom it quickly sheds that superficial layer and gets seriously dark
movies,not_removed,the borderlands is pretty fucked up
movies,not_removed,you should try that other little known film the ring
movies,not_removed,i guess i was thinking sleeper like in regard to something you dont expect to scare the shit out of you that actually does the grudge really caught me by surprise in that way i just threw it on like five years after it was released out of boredom
movies,not_removed,it was fun to try to name the featured films while watching this he mostly picked pretty lowhanging fruit but a couple had me scratching my head then i saw that you could turn on closed captioning to see the videos great for how accessible it manages to be in spite of academic sensibility at the same time though i really felt that he was grasping at straws with many of his main points making these sweeping generalizations that dont quite say much the notion that it makes film have this unreal dreamlike quality or even makes film more real isnt really unique to black and white the alternative versions section was really impressive anyway and now im trying to track down the mist in bw
movies,not_removed,it helps a ton if the movie takes the time to actually get you to care about its characters like in halloween and alien
movies,not_removed,create a tense atmosphere like john carpenters the thing make it seem pleasant and usual but then hint that there is something off about the environment and let it gradually creep up to the point that you then reveal your scares which poltergeist did well in its shifting between daytime and nighttime scenes make your cast of characters as ordinary as possible so the audience can relate best to them a la alien dont be afraid to let the audience know that nobody is safe and while were at it its best to show the monsterdemonevil entity in small bits and pieces and wait until the third act to reveal its true form which must look scary as cronenbergs remake of the fly and david finchers have taught me you should allow room for undercurrents of thematic depth to creep beneath the skin of your scary movie the more relevant the themes and the more relatable the allegory the more effective itll be on audiences one good way to check this is to ask what your horror film is saying about the current state of the modern world human nature the meaning of our existence etc and how said film is supporting its thesis visually and narratively
movies,not_removed,i like when horror films make the characters do things they arent supposed to do jump scares are nice but not when theyre predictable in the conjuring there we a lot of predictable jump scares compared to lights out i had goosebumps the entire time
movies,not_removed,i like when a horror movie is more then some killing role just taking out everyone cabin in the woods is a perfect example of a story that actually has some substance to it that makes it much better
movies,not_removed,a good horror movie can connect to something simple you have in real life so you feel randomly scared long after you watched it example nightmare on elm street its the only movie that made me scared after sleep not before
movies,not_removed,days later is the masterpiece of modern horror you feel for the characters you feel for the situation you dont know who to trust and they limit the jump scares and the js that happen are well thought out no movie has scared me so much as this
movies,not_removed,i agree i love a good slasher flick but they are different things
movies,not_removed,i know people complained that cruise isnt as tall as the character is described in the books but when it came down to it he played reacher well personally looking forward to this one
movies,not_removed,jesus christ thats jack reacher
movies,not_removed,honest question has tom cruises face changed
movies,not_removed,jack reacher never stop never going back
movies,not_removed,tom cruise makes some seriously good movies cant wait for the next mission impossible
movies,not_removed,ill admit it i would go see this just to see tom cruise be jerkoff reacharound again the first movie was so fuckin good it was popcorn as all hell but my friends and i still quote that movie because its just so in touch with what it was trying to be did i have a knife in siberia i was sandy too i was on a beach can you put a shirt on this is my shirt
movies,not_removed,that punch through the window was fucking badass
movies,not_removed,love cruise but he can never be jack reacher
movies,not_removed,move over james bond
movies,not_removed,jack reach around
movies,not_removed,battlefield hardline ﻿
movies,not_removed,he may be a crazy motherfucker in real life but he never really phones in a performance on screen really good actor
movies,not_removed,how tall is the old man wanting the airplane bathroom cruise towers over him lol
movies,not_removed,he almost certainly had plastic surgery just like the vast majority of other leading actors his age
movies,not_removed,no this is his typical stern face
movies,not_removed,i assumed he was finally ageing
movies,not_removed,hes finally getting old that skin aint holding up the way it use to
movies,not_removed,shoot me like we shot bin laden
movies,not_removed,tom cruise punching people the movie
movies,not_removed,well i need to see something how about the inside of an ambulance
movies,not_removed,the only guy i can think of that would be physically jack reacher and also have the name to pull numbers for a blockbuster is chris hemsworth but when the first movie was casting hemsworth was not yet the big name he is today and hes pretty young to have ten years in the mps after college more so at the time of filming lee child was clearly not thinking ahead to his film rights when he wrote reacher to be such a manbeast
movies,not_removed,this i have real issue with tc playing reacher hes a great actor but the whole point of reachers persona and peoples reaction to him is his physical size imagine the books with a nothing character just wouldnt work
movies,not_removed,i am looking forward to the airplane scenes the book was good
movies,not_removed,i think they do a lot of camera magic in cruise movies to make him look taller in reality i think hes like ft something
movies,not_removed,really which major actors have i always thought it was a little taboo
movies,not_removed,okay now im not at all certain about this suggestion as this actor has kind of painted himself into a corner but what about the rockdwayne johnson
movies,not_removed,agreed what would you think about the rock as reacher
movies,not_removed,most people are something
movies,not_removed,cruise is
movies,not_removed,hes not as short as everyone makes him out to be im and i cant believe how much i liked jack reacher i thought it looked so stupid and i saw the trailer about it seemed to play at every movie i saw for months leading up to it i watched it on netflix by chance like a year later and i was hooked within five minutes it was so good i hope this one is
movies,not_removed,tom cruislet
movies,not_removed,name any leading actor past and they more than likely had plastic surgery the major exception would be character actors who have a particular ugly or interesting look but even those get some work done once their facial features start to sag or disappear with age most plastic surgery is actually quite minor usually they remove wrinkles on the sides of their eyes usually do some small lifts on their neck or cheek bones and almost all take botox injections to remove forehead wrinkles some are more appearance altering than others examples of the more extreme plastic surgery would be people like alec baldwin and sylvester stallone they just look like different people after surgery more subtle will be folks like tom cruise tom hanks etc who usually just do small lifts to maintain a tight and unwrinkled appearance usually you just need to look at someones face look up their age and ask what is going on william shatner is close to years old how many people his age have such smooth facial features its not just good diet and exercise even wrinkly old clint eastwood had a bunch of work done which you can see if you look up pictures of his neck and see how that skin compares to what is on his face
movies,not_removed,not to insult tom cruise but its commonly known he wears shoe lifts it adds about four inches to his height so he was probably when you saw him
movies,not_removed,ok i can see that now you mentioned it i guess nobody really questions it when they see an actor aging perfectly they just think oh hey heshe is good looking anyway makes sense
movies,not_removed,plastic surgery isnt necessarily the correct term for sort of minor touch ups that youre talking about youre absolutely correct that most aging actors use them but most of that is botox filler etc to touch up wrinkles aging lines and stuff plastic surgery is a different thing altogether
movies,not_removed,i worked with him every day for like months i never saw any lifts unless they were super well concealed but to be that tall i feel like his shoes would look like the ones the aliens wear in battlefield earth
movies,not_removed,is he as nice and cool as ive heard any stories
movies,not_removed,hes one of the greatest people ive ever worked with just an awesome fun shockingly down to earth guy
movies,not_removed,as performed by from iasip
movies,not_removed,probably they had carrel ad lib his lines and then they shot carreys scenes with him mouthing the sounds carrell came up with
movies,not_removed,most likely carrey was filmed reacting to carrell after carells scene was filmed
movies,not_removed,cause carrey is god
movies,not_removed,i think the funniest stuff didnt make the final cut because the rest of the cast and crew laughed over it
movies,not_removed,they dont need to sync it at all hes just moving his mouth in vaguely the right way and they edited it with the carrey bits that fit the best and your mind tricks you into the rest look closely at around the mark carrey is moving his mouth when carrel isnt saying anything once you see it none of carreys stuff looks quite right but thats the magic of movies
movies,not_removed,sounds about right with a bit of practice anyone could do it and jim carrey just happens to be very good at that kind of thing
movies,not_removed,i am not sure but i am pretty sure it is pretty often that caused her made
movies,not_removed,seems like shes moved on to the thankless mom role but hey what do i know im a bear i suck the heads off fish
movies,not_removed,i feel like she always plays a becky
movies,not_removed,i find her hot lol
movies,not_removed,who
movies,not_removed,cant stand her and she has lousy breasts
movies,not_removed,was she in that movie too
movies,not_removed,trixie and kitty
movies,not_removed,whoa you think a hollywood actress is hot no fuckin way dude
movies,not_removed,judy greer wasnt in kiss kiss bang bang but hey what do i know im a bear i suck the heads off fish
movies,not_removed,i think rtelevision might be more receptive to your post op
movies,not_removed,i think its not a movie
movies,not_removed,thought it was good
movies,not_removed,the only reason i got through the first half of season was because i was literally at home waiting for it to stop raining it lacked depth and the humor was even cheaper than family guy at its worst however i kept on watching and it got a bit better i wasnt that eagerly waiting for season and it took me some time after the release to watch and boy was i blown away the way it touches on real life issues in such a humorous yet balance and mature way had me questioning my own outlook on issues any show that can do that is worth my while season is where it reaches the heavenly standard for me your can basically take this plot give it to a big time ensemble cast and get a top quality drama out of it so deep so well constructed and well written i had tears in my eyes watching the ending scene even if i know this is just some animated comedy series

movies,not_removed,from a purely intellectual perspective i feel that many teen movies couldnt be made in this political climate

movies,not_removed,ill say for example that i have no idea what the repeated jim never at home thing from airplane is supposed to be a reference to assuming it even is a reference to something there was an add campaign at the time for coffee the set up was a husband and wife were out for dinner and the husband orders a second cup of coffee the wife then has an inner monologue about how jim never orders a second cup at home a narrator then explains why shitty coffee x is so good

movies,not_removed,not really an answer to your question but there is a scene in avengers that confused me for the longest time towards the beginning of the movie captain america bets nick fury that nothing would surprise him anymore quite a bit later into the movie they are both aboard a military base that lifts into the sky and thus cap gives fury its incredibly subtle and upon my first few viewings i honestly thought he was just giving him the money because hes black thinking about it now it seems to make no sense but others i knew thought the same thing

movies,not_removed,its not really a joke but i still dont know what morgan freeman meant with the line and your plan is to blackmail this person in tdk did morgan accept that reese found out the secret and just told him straight up that bruce would destroy him or was he merely pointing out the absurdity of reeses assumption so that it could never be possibly true
movies,not_removed,the two pussy jokes from predator

movies,not_removed,maybe it wasnt a joke but i never understood the repeated you have some red on you line from shaun of the dead people giggled at it in the theater and shrug
movies,not_removed,stupid is as stupid does
movies,not_removed,youve probably never seen a folgers coffee commercial before
movies,not_removed,my answer is actually the other way around theres a joke in its a wonderful life that always cracks me up that nobody ever seems to get in the scene where theyre showing each characters contribution to the war effort during world war ii they show george as an air raid patrolman his mom volunteering with the red cross his brother being a war hero etc but then they declare that mr potter was the head of the draft board or something along those lines i feel like its such a straightforward joke the villains contribution to the war effort is sending people to war ive never heard anybody else laugh at it though even the time i was in the theater and everyone was actively laughing at each humorous scene i was the only one in the theater who laughed at this one it was the only joke that i laughed out loud to through the entire movie so i immediately shut myself up after no one else laughed with me it might be my favorite joke in the entire film
movies,not_removed,why are you pulling my dick in heathers
movies,not_removed,the and then scene from dude wheres my car i allways feel like i am missing something
movies,not_removed,i still dont get the joke in shrek when donkey says and in the morningim making waffles im no donkey expert so im unaware of their love for waffles
movies,not_removed,which would be worse live as a monster or to die as a good man
movies,not_removed,jared letos joker in suicide squad i mean clearly it was some kind of joke and obviously there should be a better interpretation of the joker in the next movie i just wish i knew what was so funny
movies,not_removed,the one in the trailer of the big short even if it kinda makes sense its still not funny at all
movies,not_removed,clearly youve never been to singapore jack sparrow to one of the guards after saving elizabeth from drowning as an exsingaporean even i dont get that line pls explain
movies,not_removed,if i take that mask off will you die it will be extremely painful youre a big guy for you what was the hack nolan trying to convey here i didnt even crack a smile
movies,not_removed,a lot of iron man jokes and a couple from deadpool
movies,not_removed,all the jokes in the last few adam sandler films theyre presented just like jokes but i dont get them at all must be too smart for me
movies,not_removed,napoleon dynamite napoleon invites a girl for the prom her mother makes her go with him and that despite the mother never seeing napoleon herself im not even sure whether it was a joke it just confused me
movies,not_removed,hes referencing marys bewilderment upon discovering that she a virgin was pregnant
movies,not_removed,also before zee germans get there
movies,not_removed,see the bible second coming
movies,not_removed,its a joke about how ridiculous it is to think that the virgin mary was still a virgin and shes actually very accustomed to come
movies,not_removed,someone explain zee germans for me or is it only as deep as england fought zee germans in both world wars
movies,not_removed,to me i always thought that mary wanted a second round in the sack from the angel
movies,not_removed,never knew this was a reference until now i always have chuckled just because it seems like it was deliberately setting up and ignoring some kind of infidelity subplot or something
movies,not_removed,plus its worth mentioning that joke was very much a meme when airplane first came out like wheres the beef it was a wellworn staple of comedy and such
movies,not_removed,makes sense thanks
movies,not_removed,i never knew that until the or time i saw that movie but i always found that line funny for whatever reason
movies,not_removed,slightly off topic but is there somewhere i can see more american tv adverts edit i mean not youtube in general but a collection
movies,not_removed,oh my gosh i mean i saw airplane in the theaters when i was a kid and i got the joke but i didnt realize it was the same actress too good nice
movies,not_removed,holy shit
movies,not_removed,i still dont get it
movies,not_removed,she just had it stuffed
movies,not_removed,the bit i never understood was when frank compliments her on her ankle bracelet and she says did it slip down there again what exactly was it
movies,not_removed,since nobody explained it beaver is slang for a womans nether regions here in the us
movies,not_removed,isnt it a running gag in honey i shrunk the kids that the kid doesnt get it either like the last line of the movie is him going i get it french class
movies,not_removed,selma blairs character in cruel intentions was incredibly innocent and completely oblivious to sex and partying she thought she was just drinking an ice teacold tea but it was a long island ice teaalcohol
movies,not_removed,k i dont get the cpr one
movies,not_removed,like years of waking up every morning and asking yourself god what did russ mean when he said french class or just like standing in line at a walmart years later and being like oh i get it
movies,not_removed,please explain the ice tea joke
movies,not_removed,the cpr one will date itself with many first aid groups st john red cross moving away from instructing the breathes at the basic level and instead just the compressions
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,where did you learn cpr french class you are using the term joke quite liberally
movies,not_removed,excellent cultural context but the joke stands up without knowledge of the commercial too the wife is taking notice and overlyworrying that something is going on with her husband due to his seeminglychanging habits on the trip
movies,not_removed,right at the beginning of this commercial they do the exact bit riffed in airplane i think the reason it resonated so well was it was a long lived series of commercials with the same basic script but set in many different situations home the neighbours house the office a restaurant and on and on to the point it was a meme before there were memes
movies,not_removed,i think the toad one is meant to mean youre just as fucked by my powers as anyone else would be but the line was so awkwardly written and clumsily delivered that it barely felt like a joke at all
movies,not_removed,i think the joke about the seashells is purposefully ambiguous so the viewer is left trying to picture how that would work
movies,not_removed,you know how they use shells instead of toilet paper in russia in the future they will have improved tech so much that you only need shells
movies,not_removed,you know how they say the best horror is whats left to the imagination the same thing applies to demolition mans seashells bit its purposefully left without explanation to illustrate the absurdity of the future era in the film its a matter of fact no explanation required thing for the future citizens but stallone and the audience are left bewildered and now having to think of how it works
movies,not_removed,the seashells has something to do with the director or whatever calling a friend to come with something fast for the scene of the bathroom and the friend said i only have seashells by my side and the directorwhatever said ok ill work with that but yeah you better search for the story because my explanation is far from good
movies,not_removed,the toad joke is just really shitty joss whedon writing dont worry about it
movies,not_removed,i get they were going for an anti joke but it croaks just wouldve been a better line
movies,not_removed,seashells in demolition man you are not supposed to understand the seashells thats the joke its a well if you were actually from this future society you would get it but you are the same as sly so it wont make sense to your antique brain lightningstruck toad in xmen joss whedon wrote that line and if you search for it theres a long old av club interview where he discusses it basically it was written to be a throwaway line but berry apparently thought that it get a bigger laugh if she pounced on it like a tiger on a wild pig
movies,not_removed,the seashells is the funniest thing about demolition man because it doesnt make sense its a fun one to work into everyday life
movies,not_removed,there really is nothing to get with the toad one in the context of the movie it didnt make any sense and it is really the same for the seashell thing
movies,not_removed,want to know more about the shells method
movies,not_removed,do you know what happens to a toad when its struck by lightning it croaks is how my inner year old would write the line from whedon himself in an interview with the av club he defends the line saying that the line wasnt delivered correctly
movies,not_removed,ive said it before and ill say it every god damned time this comes up her punchline should have been it croaks
movies,not_removed,i remember seeing as a detailed manual on how to use the seashells but basically you scoop up the shit with the seashells from your ass then use the remaining shell to wipe away any remaining fecal matter
movies,not_removed,the toyota prius is known for being an all around green or environmentally friendly car ralph nader was a green party candidate for president in the and is an environmentalist
movies,not_removed,a prius is a hybrid electric ecofriendly car often associated with liberals nader is an environmental activist and former thirdparty farleft us presidential candidate the joke is just that the car is such a leftist thing that it was gone to support nader its not the films best joke
movies,not_removed,but how does casey take that as donatello calling him gay when the only logical misunderstanding in this context would be him confusing claustrophobic and homophobic
movies,not_removed,the actual line is youve never even seen another guy took me a while too
movies,not_removed,according to urban dictionary its just a way of saying stay the hell away from my girl
movies,not_removed,what that hell does he mean im more confused by the jokers im of a mind to make some mookie line or whatever it is he says there
movies,not_removed,its the fact that hes treating a mortal wound like that of a papercut he has ran it under a cold tap ie given it a wee clean
movies,not_removed,its a joke about how old people tend to downplay their ailments either in attempt to still be perceived as younger or to not burden their loved ones
movies,not_removed,your best bet is to not question the humor in kung pow
movies,not_removed,the explanation is pretty simple but ill need a couple things to clarify let me know if you see a radio shack
movies,not_removed,dude saw a anniversary screening with oedekirk over the weekend that movie is ridiculous forever
movies,not_removed,the joke is supposed to make no sense and be crappy but everyone in the room laughs anyway since they dont want master pain aka betty to murder them if they dont go along with it
movies,not_removed,i think i heard that judd nelson was just vamping and the joke has no punchline
movies,not_removed,that line is ad libbed by the actor and is intended to not have a punchline i think its whole purpose to have the audience think wtf is he thinking because hes such a weird dude
movies,not_removed,why did i have to look so far down to find this it makes no sense whatsoever
movies,not_removed,i may be remembering incorrectly but i think the joke here is that theres nothing funny about it and tracy a comedian actually has no idea what is and isnt funny
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,you missed the first part of the joke he says she called my vanity license plate inscrutable hilarious the joke is that the vanity license plate is absolutely inscrutable and shes right
movies,not_removed,i see you ate one am i get it
movies,not_removed,its okay half the joke is that it takes steve martin forever to get it and im pretty sure chevy chase never gets it based on the look on his face
movies,not_removed,this is a subtle jab at jeff dowd one of the seattle seven who was the reallife inspiration for the dude edit let me further clarify that the seattle seven were antiwar protesters from the seattle liberation front who were charged with conspiracy to incite a riot after a violent protest at a courthouse
movies,not_removed,its not a joke just backround for the character
movies,not_removed,as someone who is from port huron mi ive never heard of the port huron statement
movies,not_removed,the joke is that his accomplishments sound really meagre compared to the big lebowski
movies,not_removed,its a visual joke the visual for hyperspacefaster than light travel in star warstrek is usually a field of stars becoming a pattern of lines as the ship quickly moves past them the joke is that if you go even faster everything looks plaid another pattern of lines except much sillier
movies,not_removed,plaid is a pattern like a plaid shirt the same pattern used in the ludicrous speed effect
movies,not_removed,its a reference to a space odysseys
movies,not_removed,the joke is that youll never understand creed and that once anything in his life is explained itll cease being funny
movies,not_removed,if word gets out that i have asthma they wont let me scuba and if i cant scuba then whats this all been about
movies,not_removed,the joke is that creed is insane
movies,not_removed,i could be wrong but i also saw it as creed just being creed
movies,not_removed,in the cartoon bugs sits down at a piano places a candelabra upon it and utters the phrase i wish my brother george was here the reference was to liberace who had a brother george and was also his conductor on tv it also references liberaces personal appearances during the liberaces feature film debut sincerely yours also produced by warner bros was released around the same time as this cartoon according to the wikipedia page httpsenmwikipediaorgwikihydeandhare
movies,not_removed,also hip hop legend del tha funky homosapien referenced this with the title of his first album i wish my cousin george was here never got the connection
movies,not_removed,orange slices is a half time tradition in kids sport especially in australia whenever i played a team sport a parent would always bring oranges because it was a quick tasty way of getting everyone rehydrated and ready for the second half so when scott says that about oranges its a quip on the halftime break as everyone else is still fighting and he would love a break
movies,not_removed,have a kid in youth soccer sometimes they are more excited about the snacks than the game itself
movies,not_removed,with your newfound knowledge about halftime oranges now enjoy this story about footballersoccerer rodney marsh he played a mere nine times for england there was a reason for that too when alf ramsey told him if you dont work harder ill pull you off at half time marsh replied crikey alf at manchester city all we get is an orange and a cup of tea he was never picked again
movies,not_removed,the orange slices quip that ant man says at the end of the airport fight in cap civil war as says further down before gatorade orange slices were what kids used to rehydrate playing soccer or football or any endurance sports my dad used to provide the oranges for my team when i was a kid so its the same as if ant man had said does anyone have some gatorade at the end of the airport fight
movies,not_removed,i think not american but just a guess that orange slices are often given out at little kids soccer games maybe antman was commenting on how young peter parker is
movies,not_removed,i believe this is because hes wiped out and orange slicesvitamin c is supposed to be good for recovery
movies,not_removed,yeah as a brit this totally threw me i assumed it was something to do about citric acid and wounds or something
movies,not_removed,it could also mean that antman mains gp and needs oranges for the heal and cleanse after getting smashed unlikely
movies,not_removed,orange slices were given at halftime to kids at socccer games because they not only helped hydrate but gave a boost of energy with the fructose i think it was antmans way of saying he was exhausted from the melee and since they were a team anyways i understood it it wasnt hilarious but it made me smile
movies,not_removed,i took it as him needing something to bite on to not pass out it is established earlier in the scene the only other time he grew big he passed out edit more some people use this method to not pass out when trying auto asphyxiation its clear at the end of the battle that he is out for the count and not going to have a round two
movies,not_removed,there are many speculations around the internet about what the joke means my favorite is that deadpool called the guys toilet a litterbox therefore calling him a pussy we also should take into account that deadpool canonically hates cats even so the line is funny even without meaning the delivery by ryan is still funny enough to get a laugh out of me every time for those unaware of the full lines deadpool i will kill your fucking cat guy i i dont know what that really means i dont have a cat deadpool then whose kitty litter did i just shit in guy gives awkward look to deadpool deadpool anyhoo
movies,not_removed,i took it as the guy had one of those zen gardens on his desk that has the sand you can play with to relax you
movies,not_removed,there are so many jokes in that movie i had to rewatch it multiple times just to catch them all basically everything wade says is a joke
movies,not_removed,i will maintain till the day that i did that the second line should have been jim never vomits a second time at home
movies,not_removed,because of that movie as a child i spelled it clause for years not understanding the wordplay
movies,not_removed,pretty sure its just parodying the trope of james bond always getting a women because of his world saving actions
movies,not_removed,im guessing you saw the censored version in the uncensored version she offers him anal for saving her and in the end he gets it
movies,not_removed,just googled it heres the joke a man approached the window of a movie theater with a chicken on his shoulder and asked for two tickets whos the other ticket for the ticket girl asked for my pet chicken he said pointing to the bird im sorry the girl tells him but we dont allow animals in the theater the man walked around the corner of the building and stuffed the chicken into his pants he returned to the ticket window and bought a ticket entered the theater and sat down the chicken started to get too hot so the man figuring it was okay because it was dark to unzipped his pants and let the chicken stick its head out the woman seated next to him looked down in horror she nudged her friend amanda and whispered amanda this man next to me just unzipped his pants amanda replied oh dont worry about it just ignore him if youve seen one youve seen them all the woman whispered back i know i know but this ones eating my popcorn
movies,not_removed,one version an old guy approaches the window of the movie theater with a chicken on his shoulder and asks for two tickets the girl at the counter wants to know who is going in with him he replies well my pet chicken of course the girl tells him that he cant take a chicken into the theater so he goes around the corner and stuffs the chicken into his pants he returns to the window buys his ticket and goes in inside the theater the chicken starts to get hot and begins to squirm so the man unzips his pants so the chicken can stick its head out and watch the movie sitting next to him are two old women the one closest to the old guy nudges her companion and whispers lucy this man over here has just unzipped his pants her companion whispers back oh dont worry about it if youve seen one youve seen them all i know but this ones eating my popcorn
movies,not_removed,tbh million ways to die was just a terrible movie great cast and good for them if they were having fun but it was god awful
movies,not_removed,theres an actually httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgdjcwvxeulq in monty pythons meaning of life british
movies,not_removed,im american as fuck and i never liked gross out humor
movies,not_removed,it can be good on occasion when coupled with great performances and writing eg i thought it was great in bridesmaids
movies,not_removed,i actually associate that kind of gross out humour with british comedy due to mr creosote from monty pythons meaning of life as someone else mentioned and also due to from the sketch comedy show little britain
movies,not_removed,this one has more to say but its not just americans
movies,not_removed,i think its kind of a branch evolution of shock humor you used to have moments that were not particularly pleasant to watch but it was amusingly cringey like in something about mary when hes trying to spy on her with binoculars but ends up getting an eye full of saggy spraytanned old lady tits instead its hilariously over exaggerated so its amusing even if everyone was kind of groaning and going oooh nasty its evolved into two rather distinct branches one is the super shock humor with things like paul blart where he gut punches an old lady with all hes got by mistake which makes you cringe but to certain mindsets is funny then you have the overthetop grossout humor like you mentioned with obviously unreal and exaggerated shitpissvomitpusinsertagrosssubstancehere this is generally accepted as being in poor taste and only being funny to those with the mindset of a five year old but it still happens there are still rare examples of shock humor that are funny and wellexecuted but theyre few and far between
movies,not_removed,was it funny in those movies no is it wildly overused yes can it ever be funny its rare but i think so seeteam americaworld police
movies,not_removed,i think its a bit of schadenfreude watching other people go through a bit of an ordeal can be quite funny cause it isnt happening to you its like watching someone falling over you cant help but laugh
movies,not_removed,what about the laxative scene in dumb and dumber proof that poop can be funny that scene is the brown standard to which other poop scenes are measured
movies,not_removed,i think its kinda messed up angel killed a dog and its like played off as a joke during his intro song like for a musical thats all about human connection and empathy thats a pretty shitty thing to do
movies,not_removed,akita
movies,not_removed,im not sure of the context but i can tell you that capone had it pretty suite sweet in jail he was so connected that he had any comfort items he wanted they have a cell set up in estern state penitentiary with rugs and radios and all kinds of stuff to mimic his cell in his time there
movies,not_removed,i am not sure the exact joke but the biltmore hotel in miami has a suite that is called the al capone suite because it is rumoured he ran a speak easy or possibly had someone murdered there is an article about staying in the suite
movies,not_removed,its not really a joke as much as a non sequitur tommys mother noted that henry doesnt talk much and it reminded her of a story in italy about a guy who didnt say much because hes a cuckold and wouldnt be respected if he did speak up so hes content with being quiet cornuto contento translates to content cuckold or something like that if my googlefu is anything to go by it was most likely her way of telling henry that being too quiet wouldnt get him any respect from others
movies,not_removed,the guy in the story is always quiet says nothing for ages then when he does say something its inappropriate or embarrassing cant remember exactly what he said so the wife scolds him for always talking i think
movies,not_removed,the guy in the story is always quiet and always listening and observing then one day they finally get him to talk and all he does is bitch and moan about the things he sees including his wifes infidelity so the guys wife says you talk too much its both a play on if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all and shut the hell up and stop telling everyone our business i thought it was a pretty good story it also insinuates that the guy who never talks and always listens not only sees everything carefully but when pushed hard enough will tell everyone
movies,not_removed,its not a joke he was just setting himself up for a burn
movies,not_removed,its not really a joke will just needed to ask a question that would most likely yield a yes answer from anyone so when one is received he can shove the girls number in the other guys face the reason its such a well liked line isnt because of the line itself but because he just dominated some asshole knowitall so quoting the line really becomes a reference in and of itself to dominating a situation
movies,not_removed,so theres a saying that directly translates to bite the sour apple which means to do something you dont want to do or to acknowledge that you lost to someonegot burned do you have this saying english as well anyhow my friend shouted yeah dem sour first time we watched the movie
movies,not_removed,applesauce bitch
movies,not_removed,it plays off the rhyming scheme of the song im a sensitive soul though i seem thickskinned and it hurt that my friends never stood downwind and oh the shame he was ashamed thought of changin my name whats in a name and i got downhearted how did ya feel everytime that i downwind shame the visual of wilting grass and clearing out the watering hole anyway if you havent gotten it by now its farted
movies,not_removed,fart hes singing about his gas issues and how he could clear the savannah after every meal and then timon tells him to not bring up farting in front of the kids
movies,not_removed,when i get downhearted every time that i farted
movies,not_removed,so what exactly is going on in that scene i still dont get it
movies,not_removed,that little guy is the one shot he was off on the target makes mac nervous that he was so far off on one shot since thorny will be shooting at him
movies,not_removed,i think thats just him drunkenly admitting that he really isnt a typical hobbit and doesnt really belong in that society
movies,not_removed,first one is a riddle so its meant to be purposefully misleading and is spoken quickly on purpose to be extra confusing
movies,not_removed,i honestly thought he was just giving him the money because hes black wat
movies,not_removed,you mustnt have been paying attention because thats a simple setup and payoff joke
movies,not_removed,i honestly thought he was just giving him the money because hes black this made me laugh so hard
movies,not_removed,i honestly thought he was just giving him the money because hes black i still dont get this what country are you from that this even occurs to you
movies,not_removed,this is a pretty straightforward thing imo cap said there wasnt much that would surprise him anymore big reveal the shield ship can fly cap is surprised pays up on the bet simple
movies,not_removed,ha what youve seen white people just give black people money for no reason this feels like a big example of white guilt and its pretty hilarious
movies,not_removed,theres no way you could afford this ship
movies,not_removed,i honestly thought he was just giving him the money because hes black what does that even mean
movies,not_removed,i thought the same the first time i watched it
movies,not_removed,i am with you on this initially i missed the bet and saw cap giving fury the money as he entered the bridge to the big flying stupid thing i thought it was meant to be a throwback to caps recent thawing from different times at the time i thought that was a clever joke giving cap a bit more depth rather than just all american poster boy like he has to learn to fit in a different time politically whilst retaining his positive values a while later i mulled the scene over and realised that couldnt have been right because cap and fury have had prior contact to this i didnt realise there was a bet until this thread mind you its a popcorn action movie so im not beating myself up for missing a tiny detail downvotes ahoy
movies,not_removed,i took it as nick fury being the valet or a taxi cab driver
movies,not_removed,this is kim novak you get it now
movies,not_removed,you mean the taste the soup joke i assume the joke is he has no spoon instead of just saying to the waiter you forgot the spoon he wants him to realize it on his own
movies,not_removed,thats a lot of fish
movies,not_removed,the joke is you spent minutes watching that movie
movies,not_removed,so sharp much edge
movies,not_removed,the joke is that is already a company and thor suggesting they use that logo is funny because
movies,not_removed,which one
movies,not_removed,word is the gangster way to express agreement or respond in the positive casually like saying yeah so since he wrote her a rap hes replying in a ghetto fashion much humor very friends
movies,not_removed,ketchup catch up
movies,not_removed,its not unusual in bro culture to call a beer brew a brewski they were just taking it really ridiculously far by doing it to everything as sometimes one might do ironically or for humor
movies,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikihedylamarr was an actress and took the name hedy lamarr instead of her real name hedwig eva maria kiesler presumably hedley will sue hedy for infringement on his name since hes a character in a movie its sorta a meta joke all tied into his name
movies,not_removed,le petomane keeps calling hedley lamarr hedy which was a rather famous actress at the time hedy lamarr le petomane is named after a french buttfart artist
movies,not_removed,the simpsons were referencing the flying nun tv show the joke is that a nun who was so light that she could blow away in a strong windstorm using her habit as wings wouldnt be funny and whimsical it would be horrible and likely end in her injury or death i dont remember the actual episode so i cant tell you if there is more to the reference than that
movies,not_removed,chuck wagon dog food
movies,not_removed,pick up bart
movies,not_removed,there is no meaning to it from a quick article on the line a cinematic rorschach test please explain the following line of dialogue that is spoken by det lorna cole rene russo to det martin riggs mel gibson in lethal weapon close is a lingerie shop without a front window give up youre not the only one lethal audiences are puzzled by coles taunt uttered when riggs admits he came this close to catching the bad guy and even riggs himself admits i dont get it so what does it mean nothing says screenwriter jeffrey boam its a complete non sequitur the original line was something like close doesnt count or close only counts with horseshoes dick director richard donner is a funloving guy says boam and this thought just popped into his head he said lets have her say something completely off the wall boam who wasnt on the set at the time quickly faxed donner a dozen meaningless lines that began with the words close is then the whole cast and crew started coming up with them but the one they used came from russo herself this is like some line from a beatles song says boam i guess people are trying to figure it out
movies,not_removed,the joke is that the joke is terrible and doesnt make sense and the punchline has nothing to do with the setup its just the style of dumb humor in the film
movies,not_removed,i think its just a stupid joke like this rock is hard just like my penis rather than a sexual joke its a joke about not caring or not having any guilt at all
movies,not_removed,george lucas is anticigarettes and wanted to make a stand against drugs in the middle of the only scene portraying the dregs of coruscant
movies,not_removed,the dealer offers death sticks lets just assume theyre a generic drug obiwan uses a jedi mind trick to tell the dealer he doesnt want to sell death sticks since the point of a jedi mind trick is not to control someone but to influence them the dealer rescinds his offer and believes he no longer wants to sell obi wan the death sticks of his own free will obi wan perceives that the dealer may still present a danger to others so he adds you want to go home and rethink your life the dealer repeats this automatically because of obi wans influence but hes confused because its so against his normal kind of thinking that he has no idea why he would be saying that
movies,not_removed,it was an old trope that when a couple had a passionate kiss in a movie the woman would put one leg up presumably to indicate she is being caught up in the momentswept off her feet etc it never really made sense later on probably because it made no sense it became something of a joke to have the male character do this instead ive seen it happen at least once in the simpsons and possibly a live action movie too to lampshade how silly it was
movies,not_removed,jus his ridiculous bit of small talk
movies,not_removed,the first one he just spent a minute or so explaining that even if the guy was right about the identity of batman batman is a skilled fighter with all kinds of gadgets and basically unlimited resources and a track record of acting outside legal jurisdiction so some little dweeb like reese should really think long and hard before thinking he has any kind of leverage that matters
movies,not_removed,because of the echo
movies,not_removed,if you do something stupid youre stupid enough to have done that thing no matter how smart you might think you are under other circumstances kind of like a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
movies,not_removed,the context of the scene is what makes that line funny shrek doesnt want or like company he keeps to himself beware ogre signs in the front yard and reluctantly allows donkey to stay one night donkey gets too excited and thinks him shrek will have a sleepover telling manly stories and in the morning they will share a lovely breakfast together all of which shrek being a loner is not interested in it is at this point that shrek kicks donkey out of his house and has him sleep outside
movies,not_removed,its just a funny thing to say esp his delivery there really is no explanation
movies,not_removed,i dont think their is much to this joke other than funny words are funny i think they wanted to get eddie murphy to say waffles
movies,not_removed,donkey has a real hard on for waffles if you watch the shrek christmas special he has a fantasy sequence where instead of santa theres this giant parade of waffle men covered in syrup and butter dancing towards donkey so they can be eaten
movies,not_removed,apparently the movie was so edited and reshot that a lot of it was left on the cutting room floor so well never know if it was actually a good performance
movies,not_removed,jared letos joker in suicide squad in the initial cut leto plays joker closer to what he is in the comics specifically while he might care for harley in his twisted way hes too mental to truly love anyone he treats her as an object he abuses her and twice he abandons her to her potential death once to drowning in the car once he tosses her out of a helicopter just so he can escape evidently that cut freaked people out it was one of the factors that led to the massive reshoots and recutting of the movie they were worried how it would be seen as misogyny they were worried it would lessen interest in harley if she was seen as being in love with such a damaged guy etc so they butchered letos performance made some ugly awkward recuts that make no sense in the final movie joker tosses harley out of the helicopter to safety somehow to make joker seem more noble and worthy of harleys love to make harley seem not as damagedderanged etc i feel really sorry for leto he was told to play the character one way then the movie portrays him in a very different way and he gets shit on for poor acting
movies,not_removed,singapore was an east india co trading post in the era that was set so probably doesnt reflect modern singapore and presumably is a judge he that at the time it was a place of illrepute
movies,not_removed,i always thought that was to how fast he removed her corset
movies,not_removed,once again its proper punctuation to the rescue cia if i take that mask off will you die bane heavy breathing it would be extremely painful cia youre a big guy bane for you it would probably work better if cia guy didnt butt into the middle of banes line but what do i know i didnt even finish watching memento much less direct it
movies,not_removed,you got him good man
movies,not_removed,his uncle rico had talked to the mother before that scene and basically rico implied that napoleon was mentally disabled so she was just forcing her daughter to go as a nice gesture it wasnt really a joke it was just there to show that his uncle rico was a dick
movies,not_removed,most of the jokes in napoleon dynamite are really just extremely dry caricatures the people are supposed to behave oddly but in a dry way not funny thats the joke by reading too much into it youre just going to get confused its a humor type thats really not for everyone
movies,not_removed,ive always been quite torn if it meant come again like excuse me what or being impregnated by god was pretty nice do come again its probably the former though like you said
movies,not_removed,being british i always assumed it was referencing jokes in the vein of fawlty towers dont mention the war may also be comparing him to a paranoid mainland eurpoean in the time of german invasion
movies,not_removed,god has a notoriously long refractory period
movies,not_removed,i too had no idea that line was a reference it was always funny and memorable to me because the line was delivered with such earnest despite being such a trivial concern especially juxtaposed with the zaniness of the rest of the film
movies,not_removed,find an page on instagram or tumblr
movies,not_removed,the film is a prisoner of war drama film in which several members of the allied armed forces try to escape from a nazi prison camp chicken run is about a bunch of chickens trying to escape from a chicken farm the title chicken run is also a term used to denote an area of fencing designed to keep chickens secure and in one place ie a prison so the films title on face value is about a bunch of chickens trying to escape their demise of being eaten while also being a reference to the fact that they are in prison which adds to the comparison to the film the great escape
movies,not_removed,a chicken run is a term used to describe a cage that chickens are kept in this chicken coop has runs httpwwwchickencoopsdirectcomdevondoublerunhtm
movies,not_removed,a chicken run is an outdoor enclosure you let chickens roam in
movies,not_removed,a chicken run or a rabbit run is an enclosure to house rabbits or chickens its a play on words alluding to the chickens escaping
movies,not_removed,im pretty sure the joke was that it was actually a garter belt or some sorta lingerie its been a while since ive seen that scene though
movies,not_removed,i always took it as she was referring to it originally being a wrist bracelet but it slipped down maybe shes wearing it as an actual bracelet during the rest of the movie i could be totally off
movies,not_removed,ha you can say vagina i mean i got it now
movies,not_removed,iris out wait a minute iris in i get it french class hahahaha iris out again
movies,not_removed,and a wellmade long island ice tea will not taste alcoholic at all
movies,not_removed,cpr looks vaguely like french kissing
movies,not_removed,french kissing in french class giving cpr over the mouth
movies,not_removed,same here maybe its one thats easier to understand spoken out loud ive got nothing
movies,not_removed,mostly it was every time i saw those movies for the first or so years i knew that there was supposed to be a joke but couldnt figure out what it was but once i finally made connection the feeling was great
movies,not_removed,uzachliveshere explained it she thought she was just drinking an ice teacold tea but it was a long island ice teaalcohol
movies,not_removed,it was meant as a joke in the movie
movies,not_removed,exactly she says jim never vomits at home as if vomiting is linked to a personality trait rather than health
movies,not_removed,meme before there were memes memes have always existed the actual definition is an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means especially imitation richard dawkins coined the term in
movies,not_removed,there were originally several oneliners in xmen where the toad himself told other people you know what happens to the toad when something something ufortunately they were all cut out so the remaining final punchline no longer makes much sense
movies,not_removed,thanks joss
movies,not_removed,according to one interview i read the line was supposed to be played like you know what happens to a toad when its struck by lightning zap shrug nonchalant turn and walk away same thing that happens to everything else but she read it like she did he wasnt there because he wouldnt be yadda yadda yadda what the hell did she just say granted it doesnt make it the best funniest line ever or much at all but wouldve been better than what was delivered
movies,not_removed,in russia seashells use you
movies,not_removed,the seashells doesnt have an explanation in the movie i mean the audience is meant to feel as clueless as stallones character
movies,not_removed,you could just say the toad joke is just joss whedon writing
movies,not_removed,i mean the toad joke made sense it just was oddly placed and was horribly delivered the sea shells on the other hand doesnt make any sense at all which is the joke
movies,not_removed,joss whedon blaming someone else no never
movies,not_removed,thats just a stupid thing someone made the joke is that it doesnt make any sense see the seashells not being covered in shit reused without any way to dispose of them or get clean ones its meant to give us something we cannot understand so we experience the confusion of futureshock
movies,not_removed,also worth noting that ralph nader wrote unsafe at any speed in a book that accused auto manufacturers of avoiding the implementation of safety features a red prius is probably a good example of car design thats trying to implement many of the safety features he advocated plus those environmental features you already mentioned
movies,not_removed,the films best joke is when will ferrells wife dresses up as her mother and when they meet up to have sex he says seductively while undressing her from her granny clothes im gonna break your hip
movies,not_removed,casey has no idea what claustrophobic means because hes dumb so instead of admitting ignorance he gets defensive
movies,not_removed,casey is dumb
movies,not_removed,ah that makes sense id like to use that in a conversation someday
movies,not_removed,ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
movies,not_removed,yeah what the hell how did the joker have so many random sayings wonder what the urban dictionary says on that one
movies,not_removed,not just old people but british people in general are stereotyped to downplay misfortune
movies,not_removed,weeeeee ooooooooo weeeeeee oooooo
movies,not_removed,fuck that spell out the complete answer in a custom neon sign
movies,not_removed,both in the show and in real life
movies,not_removed,chevy is the dumb hot one its a great gag
movies,not_removed,this does nothing to explain the joke the port huron statement was written by members of a radical leftwing group called students for a democratic society in it was first released as a detailed manifesto advocating for stronger rights for organized labor it was reissued in with a disclaimer that basically said none of us believes in this any more and it was presented as more of a historical document the original port huron statement was an important sds document the compromised second draft was basically a useless piece of historical trivia
movies,not_removed,bunch of new left ann arbor radicals got together in or and tried to create a new mission statement for the american left did so in port huron theres a decent book about it if youre interested called democracy is in the streets
movies,not_removed,i guess i dont understand why the plaid pattern effect is supposed to be funny
movies,not_removed,murrrppphhhhh
movies,not_removed,according to the wikipedia page he cant have looked far
movies,not_removed,yeah that was one of the reasons this joke stood out to me because i already knew about the del album
movies,not_removed,this is the correct answer my wife and i are both american both played sports growing up and both laughed at this joke in the theater either they didnt realize how many people wouldnt get the joke or they didnt care
movies,not_removed,i saw it more like ant man isnt as grown up experienced or hardcore as the other heroes so the joke is that hes the kid asking the elders coaches parents if its time for a break so he can have his traditional halftime treat of orange slices
movies,not_removed,a parent would always bring oranges and dunkaroos holy fuck those were so good
movies,not_removed,its a tradition in youth sports in america too
movies,not_removed,ah this sheds some light still seems like an oddly obscure quip is ant man australian maybe im just a uncivilized non breeder that knows nothing of rearing kids lol
movies,not_removed,hard work vs tasty snacks hands down man hands down
movies,not_removed,lmao
movies,not_removed,am i correct in assuming pull you off is slang for a hand job
movies,not_removed,ok i see now you guys have definitely enlightened me to the restorative value of oranges i still thing the joke is a flat left fielder lol since you immediately caught the reference did you or the people you watched with doubled over in laughter or was it just a slight chuckle again it left us totally confused
movies,not_removed,hmm i guess it seems like a real flop of a joke or maybe its supposed to be a flop joke because of ant mans character i am american but admittedly never watched kids soccer so maybe it could be a reference to that if so my next question is why do they serve orange slices at kids soccer games is it like the gatorade or bottled water of soccer because thats what they serve at kids basketball and football games
movies,not_removed,we hear the toilet flush so it was a bad joke
movies,not_removed,thats some interesting insight i just figured it meant that deadpool had shit in an empty box somewhere in the house
movies,not_removed,this is the most plausible explanation he was making a joke too deep for the audience in movie and actual audience he flushes the toilet about when he said i did implying he shit in the dudes toilet he was calling him a pussy in a crazy complicated way then realized it anyhoo
movies,not_removed,not only that he is also literally having sex with a princess like a knight getting princess in the end of the tale
movies,not_removed,im pretty sure shes the one getting it in the end
movies,not_removed,i dont know why youre getting downvoted because thats exactly the joke
movies,not_removed,if you save the world we do it in the asshole i will be right back
movies,not_removed,it wasnt a great movie but i enjoyed it i thought seth macfarlane and charlize therone had surprisingly good chemistry and it had some fun parts the is surprisingly catchy
movies,not_removed,there is a scene early on where they joke about how no one ever smiles in old photos and i thought that was funny then they used it constantly throughout the film and the comedic effect dies sums up my thoughts on the entire movie
movies,not_removed,i didnt laugh one scene in that movie all the jokes where so horrible exéćúted and easy to know when they were cming
movies,not_removed,this is like the example and definitely not american
movies,not_removed,it worked in bridesmaids because the joke wasnt the pooping the pooping was the punchline to the joke the joke was the horrible restaurant that the main character had selected and her utter denial that it was a bad restaurant even in the face of clear evidence
movies,not_removed,fair point i actually byin to the theory that benny is the true protagonist and the rest of the cast are technically the villains as he is entitled to the rent money they owe him and have mooched off his good nature
movies,not_removed,well to understand that scene you have to understand that rent is a modernization of the opera la boheme in la boheme angel has a counterpart called schaunard angels surname is dumott schaunard who has a very similar scene where he comes home loaded after playing his violin at a parrot until it dies obviously killing animals is as you said a shitty thing to do the song probably could have been altered to contain the reference without making angel traumatize a dog into committing suicide however the creator of rent jonathan larson also died before the premiere very often musical numbers are rewritten throughout early performances of musicals based on audience reaction pacing cost etc so i wonder sometimes how much of rent would have changed if larson had survived and when i watch it i watch it as an unfinished product
movies,not_removed,if it was any other movie sure but the guy was supposed to be pretty smart i figured it had to have more depth than that
movies,not_removed,i dont think any question would do how do you like them apples was a linephrase well before the movie i think its in the wizard of oz and rio bravo its an expression for gloating
movies,not_removed,i dont know what movie but yeah thats a common phrase that just isnt used as much anymore these days i know ive heard it from various sources
movies,not_removed,oh that makes perfect sense thankstbh i may have initially dismissed that answer already because i thought they were already being pretty evident with the grass visuals and the frequent fart noiseswere they just not aloud to say the word fart
movies,not_removed,i get that much of it but i always just figured there was another layer to why he says he shouldnt worry about it im sure im just thinking too much about it i want to know why he missed it were just they messing around or something like that i always just assumed that it was a reference to something else
movies,not_removed,i suppose that back in nyc the black people that wealthy white people would have most often come into contact with would be people that they had to tip like hotel staff taxi drivers whatever i dont know but captain america wasnt wealthy back then of course
movies,not_removed,i thought a similar thing hes from the so of course he tips the black driver of the scifi flying ship its just good manners sam jackson even raises an eyebrow as if hes offended
movies,not_removed,its due to the time period that cap is from i thought maybe he was tipping him like an elevator employee or something it made sense within that context entirely
movies,not_removed,yes also wat
movies,not_removed,i snorted so hardspilled coke over my cathahahah
movies,not_removed,yeah that really isnt a subtle joke
movies,not_removed,captain america grew up in the black males did most low service jobs like shoe shining and the like most lived off of tip money that is what i believe he is referring to
movies,not_removed,not sure why the down votes i was thinking close to the same thing
movies,not_removed,i dont see how this makes any sense im a year old guy why would i be guilty i was more so referring to caps age and the time period he came from
movies,not_removed,exactly either way it was an extremely clever joke
movies,not_removed,exactly
movies,not_removed,but why her specifically and is there a meaning to poptarts its a surreal movie to begin with but that joke is particularly out there
movies,not_removed,thats true should of just posted the imdb page about the film
movies,not_removed,all of them
movies,not_removed,also since they are from boston its a little reference to former new england patriots player tedy bruschi pronounced brewski
movies,not_removed,thank you
movies,not_removed,thanks
movies,not_removed,trab puk cip
movies,not_removed,i always interpreted it to mean that without a front window to display the goods there would be no incentive for people to enter a lingerie store and it would go out of business in this scene i assumed russos character was making a weak pun and exchanging close meaning near with close meaning shut which sounds near enough to closed
movies,not_removed,ive been dense for a long time
movies,not_removed,also donkey has hooves with no opposable thumbs it would be extremely difficult for him to make waffles that was what made it funny for me
movies,not_removed,what i like about this post is that it is probably true but it could totally be false and no one would bat an eye at believing it
movies,not_removed,yeah i just wanted to say the quote again
movies,not_removed,he did a great imitation of jack nicholsons joker when he was firing the machine gun out the back of the chopper the rest of it was just a badly misguided performance that had very little to do with the established character after all the hype i was pissed that he screwed it up so badly some of it can be blamed on the script but the way leto played it is his own fault
movies,not_removed,plus her pulling off his choker makes no sense if he just saved her
movies,not_removed,i dont get why misogyny would be a bad thing in this context the joker is not a role model him treating harley like shit is not a validation of misogyny
movies,not_removed,cia guy thats aiden gillen dammit littlefinger
movies,not_removed,i think the most bizarre part of this line which i think is perfectly understandable is why is he even saying youre a big guy what does that have to do with the mask he says it like it would contradict taking the mask off being painful for bane but it wouldnt
movies,not_removed,and reign over me got some feels
movies,not_removed,this is exactly the point of the joke its both
movies,not_removed,its the former i feel like people want to assign a dirty meaning to this line because thats kind of the tone of the movie and the filmmaker see lock stock where a dude gets beat to death with a dildo but this line is super simple when someone gives you surprising news a common reaction especially across the pond is come again hes referencing how the virgin mary may have reacted when an angel told her she was pregnant
movies,not_removed,i mean yeah you are right but the title chicken run has nothing to do with the great escape
movies,not_removed,thats how i took it as well as much as it makes no sense
movies,not_removed,theres well made you mean they dont just overload it with alcohol to the point where you cringe after every sip
movies,not_removed,that is certainly not true at all lol maybe you are confused because you only consider them well made when you get one while you are absolutely blasted drunk
movies,not_removed,its talking about how you use to have to give mouth to mouth with cpr
movies,not_removed,still bothers me that she doesnt say jim never vomits a second time at home
movies,not_removed,also berry made a strange choice to play storm as a person who had never had human interaction before
movies,not_removed,i always asumed that were for pinching off residue and the last shell as a final scrape worst part is realizing they reuse the shells
movies,not_removed,how does it make sense to you
movies,not_removed,nah the best joke is aim for the bushes
movies,not_removed,yeah but shouldnt the claustrophobic be something close to gay because this way it doesnt make logical sense its a weird joke when you have to think about why would a character confuse claustrophobic with homophobic but actually meang gay
movies,not_removed,how can he be dumb if he knows cricket
movies,not_removed,you wanna get nuts come awn les git nuts
movies,not_removed,so you could get other people to not understand it too
movies,not_removed,i always thought that this was a well known saying from something besides batman especially since it was used for the title of an episode of nope
movies,not_removed,this town needs an enema
movies,not_removed,this is my first thought in my mind when you said that in national lampoons euro vacation where clark hits the bicyclist
movies,not_removed,thats because its not actually supposed to be a joke hes just explaining his bona fides
movies,not_removed,its because in scifi movies you often get color effects when the ship accelerates to light speed like the famous star wars hyperspace effect the joke is that spaceball one is going so fast that the colors have shifted from an ordinary hyperspace effect into a new ludicrous speed plaid effect
movies,not_removed,im guessing its just selfmocking about how bad their effects are
movies,not_removed,the line theyve gone to plaid insinuates that they have changed their look to plaid like someone famous changing their look or mcdonalds suddenly having plaid uniforms its not the best gag but it hangs
movies,not_removed,it isnt an australiaspecific thing im american and experienced the same thing playing sports as a kid
movies,not_removed,uk here a game of football isnt a game of football without oranges at half time
movies,not_removed,im american and always had orange slices at soccer games as a kid
movies,not_removed,you are but also if it wasnt clear from the context his manager meant it as in to substituteremove from the field of play
movies,not_removed,it was a little chuckle i mean i dont think it was meant to be superfunny asking for orange slices asking for gatorade was really just a way for us to know he was exhausted and completely spent after what had happened the funny was because it sort of hinted that the last time he was this exhausted he was a kid playing sports
movies,not_removed,he pointedly talked about how becoming giant makes him pass out so the real intention is that hes light heartedly talking about rejuvenating himself with the same snack that kids get in weekend sports its just a silly thing to talk about in a battle the audience i saw the movie with loved that line
movies,not_removed,have you heard of the term soccer mom
movies,not_removed,orange slices for all in england joke was funny
movies,not_removed,mostly its just such a whack thing to say that it helps keep the other guys offbalance
movies,not_removed,thats what i took it at too he assumed he was shitting in the guys litter box but ended up shitting in a random box
movies,not_removed,well played
movies,not_removed,lol no clue either
movies,not_removed,little did he know she was referring to penetrating him anally
movies,not_removed,got a lot of criticism in the uk that scene
movies,not_removed,i literally just googled but this ones eating my popcorn and it was the first result
movies,not_removed,im surprised at how much i enjoyed it
movies,not_removed,exactly is it a good movie not really is it the kind of movie id go out of my way to watch probably not but i also wouldnt go out of my way to switch the channel if it was on
movies,not_removed,and also the fact that it was happening while wearing incredibly expensive dresses in a very highclass boutique
movies,not_removed,also he was trying to set up a space where his friends could actually live rentfree and have facilities to pursue their artistic endeavours and his friends reject that in favour of living the bohemian lifestyle
movies,not_removed,i mean thats fine as a fan theory but theres no way you could get that from the text plus it makes no sense if you read a bit about jonathan larsons life also just from a legal standpoint theres no way benny could demand rent for a place thats full of holes and shit edit btw related to the dog i do think its played as a joke but a really dark one about how broke they are at the beginning of the song they are talking about how angel earned it on the street and she comes back with this entire song about killing the dog when i first saw the show i totally missed that it was bennys dog and thought that she was just embarrassed or ashamed about how she actually had to get the money so made up a funny story
movies,not_removed,this is exactly it having seen rent several times and heard all the songs many times you can see several spots where you know it would have changed in larson had been alive when benny sings poopoo it always bugged me as a half assed rhyme
movies,not_removed,it was a pretty clever burn
movies,not_removed,so whats the meaning behind it in those movies did someone give someone apples in rio bravo
movies,not_removed,i doubt it has anything to do with whether they were allowed to say fart its just more satisfying to the audience this way when timon stops him your brain has to figure out why which makes the joke funnier when your brain resolves it if they just said the word it would not have been as funny this is a common way to skirt the common complaints of toilet humor suggest it enough that the audience gets it and you avoid the complaint and still get to have the joke unfortunately it didnt work in your case which is the risk
movies,not_removed,not sure maybe its one of those jokes thats saved for the adults or maybe it was so they could keep the g rating
movies,not_removed,its just the humor of using rhyme to suggest a funny word instead of saying it and when you realize that they put that funny word in your head you laugh cuz its comical and fart is the perfect word to do it with because its a very rude and low class word that you wont typically hear in childrens cartoons but every kid knows it and thinks its hilarious
movies,not_removed,also note the appropriately placed tuba blast at that moment
movies,not_removed,lol alrighty then guess i havent watched it in a while
movies,not_removed,its been a while since ive seen this but i thought the snake was kind of caressing her shoulder so she thought it was rob lowe making an affectionate gesture i thought it was more of a straw that breaks the camels back when she realized she was with the wrong guy
movies,not_removed,nah its just that hes nonchalantly glossing over it in an unconvincing way to keep the newbie nervous about the prank
movies,not_removed,wait are you serious sam jacksons just smug because he knew the flying invisible ship was going to blow caps mind and he knew he won the bet
movies,not_removed,thank you i have no clue how this doesnt make sense to people i guess no one wants to look dumb
movies,not_removed,thats brilliant may well be that they were aware of that too things can have more than one meaning
movies,not_removed,i thought maybe he was tipping him like an elevator employee or something but nick fury is his boss who tips their boss
movies,not_removed,last time i did that my cat almost had a heart attack plus that shits expensive yo
movies,not_removed,you obviously didnt snort hard enough
movies,not_removed,its quite subtle a good amount of character introductions and story advancements happen before they ever get around to the punch line
movies,not_removed,but fury didnt do anything to warrant a tip it still makes no sense in context here black man who has done absolutely nothing for me here is ten dollars thanks for the help
movies,not_removed,im wondering to its never occurred to me to give someone money just because theyre black and a kind of white guilt is the only reason i could think of
movies,not_removed,how was it extremely clever thats the most basic of basics jokes ever
movies,not_removed,because poptarts taste good so you would eat them in heaven and kim novak is beautiful so she would be there with you you can basically replace her with any female sex symbol its just that she was very well known and still is in some circles think about it like she is marilyn monroe
movies,not_removed,what do you mean all of the jokes
movies,not_removed,no its not thats something guys do everywhere a brewski isnt named after tedy
movies,not_removed,what have i told you about writing on the walls
movies,not_removed,lol yeah the honest trailers sums it up pretty well jump to
movies,not_removed,imagine if you told someone to play the character as angry and stoic then the movie you were in suddenly made your character the comedy relief and then imagine reviews saying whats wrong with this actor did he think he was in a drama obviously he cant act i do feel bad for leto
movies,not_removed,carcetti
movies,not_removed,hes saying it like youre a big guy im sure you can handle the pain
movies,not_removed,hes bigger therefore he could handle more pain its dumb but i think thats where his logic ends as well as his life
movies,not_removed,this its a double entendre httpsenwikipediaorgwikidoubleentendre its like why did the chicken cross the road to get to the other side
movies,not_removed,what if i told you the word come especially in reference to getting pregnant had more than one meaning
movies,not_removed,its a reference to an earlier part of the film when turkish sees that tommy has a hand gun stuffed down his trousers he asks him why and tommy says its for protection turkish asks protection from what zee germans to mock tommy for thinking that he needs a gun and that the last time londoners actually needed guns for protection would have been with the threat of the nazis invading the idea being that even though they are involved in the criminal underworld in the uk guns are still a rarity and the type of business that turkish and tommy do does not require them later when tommy asks what happens to the rabbit if the dogs catch it turkish tells him that it gets fucked as in killed and eaten by the dogs what proper fucked asks tommy who is thinking that the dogs are going to rape the rabbit so turkish goes back to mocking him by bringing up the original joke again yes tommy before zee germans get here its just turkish mocking tommys naivety
movies,not_removed,i once used an lit recipe i found on a random cocktail website and my experience drinking it was exactly like that not that i didnt start to enjoy it after the first fourth of the glass but it was the most alcoholic thing ive ever tasted next to everclear
movies,not_removed,yes indeed if i order one and dont taste any alcohol i basically have to keep drinking to find out whether its gonna knock me on my ass or i got gypped by the bartender
movies,not_removed,spoken like someone whos never had a really good long island
movies,not_removed,im with you homes i like a stiff fucking drink im paying for the alcohol not the mix
movies,not_removed,ohhhhh that makes sense thanks
movies,not_removed,hey now i appreciate storms desire to overcome the barriers shes faced in life as a weathercontrolling mutant and sometimesafrican woman with autism
movies,not_removed,it should have been grace jones
movies,not_removed,i was talking to someone defending that line they were claiming joss whedon wrote it and that if you imagine someone like buffy summers delivering the line then it makes more sense it would be much more selfaware
movies,not_removed,theyre control knobs for a fancy japanesestyle toiletbidet
movies,not_removed,all she is saying is his toad powers arent going to help him against lightning
movies,not_removed,you still dont get the joke casey doesnt confuse the two words he doesnt know what claustrophobic means his thought isnt hey did donny just call me gay wtf man its actually i have no idea what he just said uh quick say something clever and then he fails as april would describe it miserably casey is a lug hes muscle and the entire movie works to show you that there aint much going on upstairs
movies,not_removed,idiot savant
movies,not_removed,just be sure to have an apparently bulletproof serving platting stuffed under your shirt when you say that
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,exactly then i can see the confused look on their faces when i tell em my rhubarb is not to be rubbed
movies,not_removed,so many oddball great lines in that movie that never have any context
movies,not_removed,why doesnt jack get more cred i know heath brought a new level of darkness to the big screen jokers but there was a great campiness to joker that fit burtons set perfectly
movies,not_removed,hes a suitor
movies,not_removed,thats the best i could draw from it as well as awesome as the movie is i guess i just didnt find that particular gag very funny
movies,not_removed,canadians as well
movies,not_removed,i lived for halftime oranges during my soccer games as a child
movies,not_removed,yeah im american and everybody i knew got it
movies,not_removed,was really just a way for us to know he was exhausted and completely spent after what had happened i think a majority of the jokes purpose is to downplay the seriousness of the fight like okay thats enough roughhousing lets all go inside for some orange slices
movies,not_removed,yes the mom with the minivan carpooling kids to soccer games i just had no clue orange slices were a part of that culture i was a little league and all stars baseball kid our thing was sodas beef jerky and big league chew
movies,not_removed,we had gatorade when i was a kid and we still got orange slices at halftime
movies,not_removed,considering how smart the parody was through the rest of the film that bit just seemed a bit too austin powers just crass instead of clever also from uk
movies,not_removed,it wasnt just about living the bohemian lifestyle they also point out that if benny does do that it will destroy tent city and displace many homeless people
movies,not_removed,yeah theres several lines like that in the musical i think the production team was wary to edit it after the release preferring to leave it as this monument to larson which is understandable but i think it would be a better monument if it was cleaned up a bit
movies,not_removed,in my defence the bet itself was a quick line in a long conversation and the film introduces a lot of characters and locations between the bet being made and the payoff i mean i get that i totally read the scene wrong but i dont think its a completely retarded mistake to make this has popped up a few times on reddit with other people making the same mistake
movies,not_removed,it really isnt though maybe compared to other jokes in the movie or mcu but in the breadth of comedy films its nowhere near subtle
movies,not_removed,that and the fact that nick fury is basically capts boss at the time and who tips their boss
movies,not_removed,captain america is from the is what hes getting at he does a few things throughout the movies to point out that hes super old
movies,not_removed,its clever because of the timing and delivery of the joke thats kind of what comedy is
movies,not_removed,maybe my hatred since childhood of pop tarts has blinded me from fully enjoying this joke the insert generic sex symbol makes sense except that monroe is still wellknown youd need to have a really deep knowledge of hollywood history to get the novak reference at first hearing
movies,not_removed,i know it is but ted specifically calls it a tedy bruschi as a combo of the word brewski and the patriots player as a reference to them being from boston
movies,not_removed,thats not a double entendre
movies,not_removed,this was exactly the phrase i was looking for had work brain cheers
movies,not_removed,youre delusional
movies,not_removed,sometimesafrican woman sums up storms movie appearances i love in dofp logan asks charles to find scott jeanstorm i know wolverine has his memory problem but did he really not know her name
movies,not_removed,legend has it that it was meant to be a sarcastic throwaway line the same thing that happens everything else eyeroll which while not a masterful line would have been fine its not clear if its singers or berrys fault that it was delivered with such gravitas
movies,not_removed,ororo munroe is not buffy summers if that was the intention then that just makes the line all the worse
movies,not_removed,i still think its a terrible line
movies,not_removed,im a different guy but now i get it
movies,not_removed,and make sure to take the shot to the chest
movies,not_removed,well ill tell you what i am im the pater familias
movies,not_removed,the orange slices thing isnt restricted to soccer though the same way soccer mom stereotypes arent restricted to mothers of soccer players orange slices are pretty ubiquitous with any sports related event with kids whether that be football soccer wrestling baseball basketball track etc
movies,not_removed,it just didnt fit the tone of the rest of the movie if there had been other similar jokes throughout then it wouldve been acceptable but to just drop that in there for whatever reason was totally pointless
movies,not_removed,in hindsight it seems like there are some gentrification issues that went over my head as a teenager
movies,not_removed,ahh that gives it some sense i never would have thought of it like that by myself
movies,not_removed,he hands him a ten dollar bill in a moment when he is amazed and nick is by chance near thats what you call clever because of timing and delivery
movies,not_removed,well she is pretty well known she is one of the hitchcocks blondes but hey its just a joke
movies,not_removed,found the shitty bartender
movies,not_removed,i dont need fop goddammit im a dapper dan man
movies,not_removed,i had to think about it for a while and to be honest i never noticed the exchange at all the first time i watched it
movies,not_removed,this exactly what i was thinking it wasnt some kind of consolation cause hes a guilty white guy its a tip for the experience he just gave him lots of others have thought this as well
movies,not_removed,do not seek the traysure
movies,not_removed,well aint this place a geographical oddity two weeks from everywhere
movies,not_removed,we thought you was a toad
movies,not_removed,mrs hogwallop done runnoft
movies,not_removed,weee thhhought youuu waaas aaaa toooad
movies,not_removed,hes still bitter about losing the best director oscar to his ex wife a few years ago
movies,not_removed,or you know most blockbusters are trash hence why they nominate arrival inception and mad max fury road because those happen to be good blokcbusters edit turns our arrival might not be a blockbuster i thought it had commercial success and had a certain commercial orientation hopefully inception is a good substitute
movies,not_removed,who gives a shit the oscars is just a big selfcongratulatory wankfest
movies,not_removed,to me theres two different sides to film entertainment and artistic value a solid blockbuster usually delivers on entertainment but lacks the certain something that makes it unique films that incorporate superb acting directing writing cinematography music are the ones that stay with you occasionally you see a film that does both and thats special but its important to recognize the people who keep the art of fimmaking alive by making though provoking passionately crafted movies that possess all the aforementioned qualities
movies,not_removed,most blockbusters dont deserve the attention for fucks sake blockbusters get all the attention for the rest of the year let movies made for adults have a goddamned minute here before everything becomes about profits again ugh get it together cameron
movies,not_removed,what was titanic jim
movies,not_removed,what blockbusters from shouldve been nominated then tell me because maybe i missed them it was a shit year for big hollywood blockbusters i enjoyed jungle book civil war deadpool deepwater horizon and dr strange and i loved rogue one and star trek but those are hardly oscarworthy the rest of the big hollywood movies were just okay or straight up sucked
movies,not_removed,i agree but like other people said there isnt too many blockbusters that deserve nominations for academy awards but theres certainly more than what we get the oscars dont mind films being popular they just have to be popular in the right way
movies,not_removed,id call titanic a blockbuster and lotr maybe even films like gravity interstellar and the martian which were all best film nominees sure not many win best film but they often do very well in other areas also avatar did pretty well so i have no idea why he would come to this conclusion
movies,not_removed,awarding movies the masses like no cant do that
movies,not_removed,because blockbusters by their very design appeal to as wide an audience as possible with all of the inevitable compromises
movies,not_removed,yeah its definitely not that blockbusters are put to make money and oscar season movies are made specifically to win an oscar
movies,not_removed,its true
movies,not_removed,well lets try to list them since were talking about cameron the obvious first choices are aliens and of recent years only mad max fury road comes to mind
movies,not_removed,all the transformers movies duh
movies,not_removed,he won like for titanic i think hes fine about it
movies,not_removed,well she hasnt done anything that good since just some propos for the military that a it
movies,not_removed,is arrival a blockbuster
movies,not_removed,lol arrival and even to a large extent mad max were hardly blockbusters especially not arrival though
movies,not_removed,arrival is behind la la land and hidden figures in terms of domestic gross it also has less than a quarter of the budget of mad max so i would not call it a blockbuster great film though
movies,not_removed,i dont get why reddit loved arrival its like cloud atlas all over again i just did not enjoy it
movies,not_removed,movies for adults get off your high horse what does that even mean im not considered an adult or a film fan if i think some blockbusters deserve oscar attention
movies,not_removed,made for adults seriously more like built for snobs who cant enjoy anything that isnt a wankfest about tragedy or the millionth reenactment of year old social issues with the idiotic pretense that the mere depiction of either is automatically depth or quality how arrogant can you fucking get
movies,not_removed,arent jungle book star wars and doctor strange all nominated too
movies,not_removed,fury road might as well be a michael bay movie minus the cringy dialogue and nonsequitur scenes other than great visuals and cool action sequences the movie is paperthin there is little to no meaningful character development no good dialogue and very little in terms of story as an action film i understand if you put it high on your list but as a film competing for an oscar it certainly does not deserve best picture
movies,not_removed,so why he complaining then
movies,not_removed,zero dark thirty
movies,not_removed,its one of the highestrated films ever made but okay
movies,not_removed,fury road was a million dollar sequel to an already established franchise released in the middle of summer movie season it may not have been the highest grossing movie of the year but i would consider it a blockbuster
movies,not_removed,that was a pretty condescending thing for him to say but you have to admit most blockbusters focus more on earning back their massive budgets and making a huge profit than taking risks or trying to achieve something meaningful
movies,not_removed,im assuming they just mean its nice that the oscars give attention and bring discussion to smaller smarter more serious films as opposed to captain america which doesnt deserve it and doesnt need it
movies,not_removed,if thats all you have to add or give a huge steaming pile of shit about your opinion
movies,not_removed,nothing you said refutes that these films arent made for adults why did that part bother you so much films that deal with complex mature themes and issues arent likely going to be understood by the large majority of young audiences so of course theyre made for adults also liking those films doesnt automatically mean you hate all other movies
movies,not_removed,how antiintellectual can you get am i a snob for wanting a watch a few movies a year that dont end in a fight scene
movies,not_removed,jaws has been panned
movies,not_removed,sick movie it was nominated for best movie and won oscars
movies,not_removed,in what sense was jaws panned it opened to critical acclaim won three academy awards and was nominated for best picture in which it was competing against four films that were far superior also what did it do on an artistic level aside from helping to usher in the age of blockbusters and influencing every cheap horror film that succeeded it im not trying to disregard its legacy i like jaws but its influence could be seen as having just as much of a negative impact on film than a positive one
movies,not_removed,i felt the jungle book deserved to be nominated
movies,not_removed,i think that mad max is so acclaimed on this sub because it does what it is supposed to incredibly well i think the fact that it is a high octane adventure should not disqualify it from best picture in my opinion the best picture should value movies that effectively employ the medium to tell an interesting story i think mad max does that
movies,not_removed,you will be downvoted for saying it but its true probably my most disappointing movie i saw that year its cool to watch for the action but that was about it for me
movies,not_removed,are you serious
movies,not_removed,hence propos
movies,not_removed,agreed fury road is definitely a blockbuster movie its just not considered as one i guess because it was artsy but if a balls to the walls action movie isnt a blockbuster i dont know what is
movies,not_removed,a blockbuster usually is one of two things extremely high grossing released in the summer mad max wasnt either of those things it financially underperformed making a mediocre profit and was released in may
movies,not_removed,ok heres a fact that refutes that these films arent made for adults the opposite spectrum of genres maybe aside from animated films is not only more popular overall jurassic world fast series pretty much any blockbuster but also has an audience made up of adults and for that matter for movies in general so while that doesnt necessarily say much about quality it does say a lot about the audience and proves irrefutably that almost all movies are for adults the only difference being genre preference which adults which movie is for and that ties in to the part that bothers me the made up distinction where there is none not like were talking about saturday morning cartoons here you can play the fool all you want but for adults is almost exclusively used a derogatory statement of arrogance a kind of the stuff i like is mature and thus good unlike all that other stuff i consider immature
movies,not_removed,you can watch whatever you want what you dont get to do is dis other stuff with arrogant bs while pretending to be better than others antiintellectual geezez fuckin christ
movies,not_removed,they all did imo at least in their respective categories so did suicide squad
movies,not_removed,i mostly consider being downvoted for unpopular opinions a badge of honor these days
movies,not_removed,lol how was it artsy it was a hour long action movie with exploding cars not that am complaining though
movies,not_removed,but i never said blockbusters arent for adults you seems to be presuming and projecting a whole lot of stuff that hasnt even been stated here the majority of young audiences are not going to be interested in arthouse films due to the complexity and maturity of themes and topics no this doesnt make them superior to everyone they likely wont understand a lot of them thus those types of films are made specifically for adults this doesnt imply that blockbusters arent made for adults or that youre not allowed to enjoy them the majority of blockbusters are made for audiences of all age ranges thus they are not solely aimed at adults you can play the fool all you want but for adults is almost exclusively used a derogatory statement of arrogance a kind of the stuff i like is mature and thus good unlike all that other stuff i consider immature i dont understand how you got to this point how are you taking for adults as a pejorative you seem insecure in what you like versus what other people like being an adult means not having to worry about being judged or ashamed for what you like
movies,not_removed,yeah its just funny that you arent supposed to downvote peoples opinions but say one bad thing about mad max the witch blue ruin or any other reddit darlings and you get all the downvotes
movies,not_removed,i think he means that its kind of experimental in the way how actionpacked it was while not especially selfaware it was certainly conciously overthetop action at least thats what i always thought
movies,not_removed,i think he means because of the bright and colourful yet gritty world as opposed to most action movies having a strictly gritty and grey world mad max fury road looked more like a painting compared to any modern action movie
movies,not_removed,pirates wins by virtue of having bender as ballmer
movies,not_removed,i really enjoyed steve jobs it led to me reading all of the biography watching all the other filmsinterviewsdocumentaries man in the machine is great and even visiting the apple museum in prague they have some good footage playing in the screening room there i saw steve jobs again recently and actually enjoyed it less than the first time heres why learning about the whole story and jobs as a man was deeply fascinating he had many inherent contradictions that seemed to spin out great creative energy when watching steve jobs again i saw far too much of sorkin as a writer and nowhere near enough of jobs almost all his lines are delivered in a whiny argumentative way like hes in a constant state of disbelief and frustration it just doesnt ring true i do admire the script structurally and how sorkin was able to weave in some allusions to the major events in creative ways but it didnt capture the core fascination of jobs for me at least i still love it as a film though the book is easily the best version of the story its very addictive always fastmoving and interesting and laden with great wisdoms and philosophies in general
movies,not_removed,i got the loot steve
movies,not_removed,i mean at this point why not watch jobs just for reference its my least liked of the three but i would disagree with anyone saying its a bad movie its easily some of kutchers better work not saying much arguably and it exists as kind of a hybrid in terms of the story it chooses to tell between the two you see jobs from atari to ipod and most of the inbetween i would say its worth watching for the sake of personal comparison
movies,not_removed,bill insisted ballmers portrayal was way off from reality but damn was it fun
movies,not_removed,hi im ballmer but you can call me bender i got ants in my butt and i needs to strut
movies,not_removed,its funny after seeing dont breathe i thought that jane levy deserves to be a big damn star because shes so good
movies,not_removed,i think we can all agree that black phillip deserves an award for his performance in the witch
movies,not_removed,ive always maintained that what helps sell horror more than anything is the performances of the actors you can use all the tricks you have to create atmosphere and a scary situation but unless your actors feel like real people that are believably scared by what theyre experiencing it wont work
movies,not_removed,he doesnt mention jane levy or dont breathe in the article im disappointed
movies,not_removed,jane levy deserves everything no just for that i watch her in suburgatory and she was great the first seasons are really good one is a mess im somewhat sad because monster trucks looks horrible and shes one of the main leads i just hope fede make a sequel for evil dead or dont breathe and we can watch her again in full glory
movies,not_removed,agreed the way she showed the fear in her eyes was so damn good
movies,not_removed,thats the goat right
movies,not_removed,monster trucks looks like it has potential to be an instant classic to its intended audience im excited to see it
movies,not_removed,fede now has two r rated horror films that opened to over hell be getting getting more work
movies,not_removed,to each his own mate
movies,not_removed,i just watched his got video about dragons very well done certainly puts my videos to shame but hes got some experience on me thanks i really appreciate it that is most definitely the plan﻿
movies,not_removed,the crap
movies,not_removed,i absolutely love this movie and have seen it over times and it still doesnt get old adam mckay is a genius tropic thunder and borat are other comedies that are infinitely rewatchable imo
movies,not_removed,i love how sam jackson and the rock were promoted as leadsand then they jump off a building and splat themselvesbrilliant
movies,not_removed,given the disappointments of anchorman and zoolander its probably best to leave well enough alone really fun flick though like stepbrothers i didnt think it was all that funny the first time around but they really grow on you whisper fight aim for the bushes gator jeter cucumber water lion vs tuna my favorite thing is keatons recurring tlc gag
movies,not_removed,pretty sure that was the last comedy movie i saw in theaters arguably my favorite will ferrell movie
movies,not_removed,other than the sam jacksonrock scene i am trying to remember a single moment that wasnt awful
movies,not_removed,masochist
movies,not_removed,i dunno that shit was crazy
movies,not_removed,i sincerely feel like the other guys is such an underrated comedy it was hilarious and i never hear people talking about it
movies,not_removed,not going to downvote because you have a different opinion but you should definitely give it another watch try extended cut its a brilliant movie
movies,not_removed,agreed on first watch i found it to be pretty average but after seeing it around times its one of my favorites by ferrel for sure will and marky mark flow together really well in it daddys home was so bad though
movies,not_removed,i was in the same boat as you the first time i saw it i thought it wasnt that great but upon rewatching it i found it hilarious
movies,not_removed,pakistani
movies,not_removed,you mean three of the best visual narratives youve seen
movies,not_removed,if you like the visuals in a space odyssey you should check out the tree of life
movies,not_removed,yep watched that when i was around or i think that movie really captivated me i more so mean visuals in this scifiishmeta commentary like state
movies,not_removed,different colors to get the different grays mysteries at the museum collection actually goes into this a little bit it is on netflix if you have it and episode i think it talks about make up strictly but could have some baring on costume color choice anyone else wanna weigh in on this one
movies,not_removed,first off it is the film that is either color or black and white all colors show up on black and white film so the idea of using gray scale costumes seems like a huge and needless expense so my educated guess is that they used normal costumes in a range of colors the better directors and especially the better cameramen of the era knew what colors would show up better on the black and white film so there was a consideration made for best contrast and so on and they did use filters when needed to either increase or decrease contrast as the scenes dictated grayscale is always at the unspoken forefront when shooting black and white but having special costumes made in just various shades of gray would be too difficult i believe
movies,not_removed,colour—but sometimes not natural ones early film stock was insensitive to red light so actors would wear green makeup to avoid looking washed out later bw film was panchromatic and didnt need that—and so why bother making greyscale sets or costumes but in the early days of colour film there were problems again with uneven sensitivity so sets and costumes were made in rather unnatural colours to read more naturally on the final print those with white skin which was pretty much all of them theres a very sad story around the way that colour film does dark skinned people few favours
movies,not_removed,correct me if i am wrong but i think kubrick made sure the tables in dr strangelove were green because they would be in real life despite filming in black and white
movies,not_removed,theres a specific color of guitar called tv white and its this kinda yellowy color its called tv white because it was specifically designed so that itd show up white on black and white televisions i assume costumes were somewhat similar things probably were just color but if something needed to be a specific shade theyd figure out the equivalent
movies,not_removed,id imagine they would use just what was to hand without specially making costumes that were grayscale that was a guess but im pretty sure that hitchcock used herscheys chocolate syrup for blood in the psycho shower scene because it behaved looked better than fake blood in black and white in other words they might not have made grayscale costumes but it might have allowed them to use materials or colors that might not look right in real life but looked good on bw film
movies,not_removed,i always understood that this is why boris karloffs monster in frankenstein is often pictured as green jack pierce the makeup artist used green makeup that would appear pallid grey on film
movies,not_removed,they use color but not necessarily the colors you might expect the colors were chosen based on how they would read in black and white there were a bunch of photos of the original adams family set from when the tv show was broadcast in black and white
movies,not_removed,in classic doctor who episodes which were filmed in black and white the aliens called daleks had orbs on their suits painted a light bluish teal sort of color because apparently it reflected the light in such a way that it appeared metallic and golden on screen i know it isnt a movie but the concept is the same
movies,not_removed,they used colors that stood out better in black and white i think that is the grey scale the first seasons of the superman tv show were black and white the actor wore a grey suit as that stood out better on black and white tv sets
movies,not_removed,they did use certain colors to bring out a desired greyblack and white for the film both for costume and make up but mostly the costumes were in color as per normal this was more true for authentic period costumes and expensive clothes like those from paris
movies,not_removed,theres a couple good writeups on cosmetics and skin regarding this httpwwwcosmeticsandskincomabamaxandthetubephp and httpwwwcosmeticsandskincomcdcearlymoviephp
movies,not_removed,no it was called tv white because tv cameras especially early ones required overlighting that turned white objects into glowing blobs of reflection so white objects and clothing were required to be offwhite shirts for instance tended to have a bit of blue in them but colors dont reflect so harshly so arent messed with nearly as much patterns however are equally problematic as certain densities of lines and weaves on fabrics create what are known as moire effects like this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjxegnrwrjfg
movies,not_removed,yup this i came here to post this but you beat me too it i need a nap
movies,not_removed,they did use certain colors to bring out a desired greyblack and white for the film both for costume and make up probably better to say that they avoided certain combinations of colors because of the gray scales they produced the colors themselves didnt matter only the grays mattered
movies,not_removed,you reposting this i saw this exact discussion posted a few nights ago
movies,not_removed,oh i had no idea lol
movies,not_removed,just wondering if it was you reposting i dont know how that other discussion turned out
movies,not_removed,the annual overweight security guard convention
movies,not_removed,its like the blueman group type of show
movies,not_removed,why dont you just wikipedia it
movies,not_removed,i tried cant find it
movies,not_removed,its funny when its batman v superman or warcraft all i heard was you cant judge it until youve seen it and formed your own opinion but when it comes to the new ghostbusters everyones suddenly talking about voting with their dollars
movies,not_removed,cutting thirty minutes from the movie isnt what made it bad
movies,not_removed,the dollar counts here bvs is a very weird situation this year there was this scatterplot yesterday that correlated good reviews to box office sucess this year except bvs the movie made but it should have been at least a billion dollar movie if not billion its stupid on thier part and they know theyve fucked up because theyve been shifting things around and getting to a hopefully better place im pretty sure everyone who saw the dark knight rises went and saw bvs tdkr would have been a bigger movie but still made a great amount of money for a longer length movie warner bros stupidity suprises me im hoping that this wont be the issue with jl snyder is the guy we have whether people like it or not and he just needs to have a coherent and decently fun movie thats hopefully in not longer than i love longer movies if it improves the movie but thats not jl needs to survive to have this dceu
movies,not_removed,you cant really vote with your money if its a new product how are you supposed to know if you like it or not until you see it
movies,not_removed,hunt for the wilderpeople is currently sitting at on rotten tomatoes with nearly reviews counted me and my wife saw it on a lark because we looked on rotten tomatoes and had either seen or didnt care about all the movies in front of it it wasnt my favorite movie ever it didnt completely blow me away but it had a lot of heart it was a charming movie that didnt just feel like hollow product it opened in america the same weekend as independence day and literally more than times as many people went to id it hurts me that people do this it took us seconds to discover hunt for wilderpeople its not that hard to research
movies,not_removed,i mean a majority of people who have seen both cuts say the longer version is actually good so by virtue cutting minutes out did make it a worse film
movies,not_removed,partly thruth obvious stuff you can vote with your money when you dont like animation stuff or the disney hype than dont go theater when you dont like comics at all dont pay for them when dont like new ghostbusters skip it and so on hollywood dont care bout reviews or stuff like this its all about box office and when only shit gets the money than they produce only shit
movies,not_removed,a majority of people who have seen both cuts say the longer version is actually good a majority of people who have seen the ultimate cut liked the theatrical cut enough to give it another shot of course the dc and snyder fans are gonna praise the extended cut thats who it was made for if you were to show the ultimate cut to every reviewer who reviewed the theatrical version youd still have a strongly negative critical reception
movies,not_removed,edge of tomorrow will become a scifi classic within the next years imo not only is the idea of groundhog day but the day is dday in the future handled well but its the one film where i was genuinely rooting for tom cruise for reasons other than just because hes the main character
movies,not_removed,inside llewyn davis basically a perfect art film masquerading as a bio pic about the greenwich village scene in the
movies,not_removed,inherent vice didnt do too well at the box office and got mixed reviews from fans and critics but i think its a film thats going to age really well people will enjoy it the more they see it
movies,not_removed,under the skin probably
movies,not_removed,nightcrawler in years it will be considered a postmodern masterpiece
movies,not_removed,the place beyond the pines epic crime drama about fathers and sons this totally flew under the radar when it came out in
movies,not_removed,i do believe daddys home will be seen as one of the greatest comedies of the and one of will ferrells highest achievements
movies,not_removed,spring breakers wow did people and critics misunderstand this one it is one of the oddest american film released in the last years but i think it is pretty much a masterpiece james franco absolutely should have an oscar for supporting actor
movies,not_removed,the counselor super brainy and bizarre spin on the drugcrime drama ridley scott directing an original script from cormac mccarthy its pretty awesome in my opinion at least
movies,not_removed,whiplash despite the oscar nom not many saw it i think it has potential to be rediscovered
movies,not_removed,its really an amazing movie
movies,not_removed,oops you had an opinion on the internet
movies,not_removed,you know you can have several films in one post rather than separately having one film for each post for karma right
movies,not_removed,huh
movies,not_removed,there were downvotes now i just look clueless
movies,not_removed,hooray who cares you work for flickering myths to get clicks dont you
movies,not_removed,nope i write my own stuff on another blog i just chucked this up here because i groaned when i saw what the poor shmuck who is gambling his acting rep would be playing and i was curious about others reactions to it
movies,not_removed,i like your username by the way
movies,not_removed,thanks and sorry to be harsh i just dont care for most of what the studio system churns out
movies,not_removed,i can understand that it can be a bit of a downer for a lot of people and transformers hit its stride just barely out of the first film as far as the bay versions are concerned i will admit it did enjoy the first one back when it came out there is a certain curiousity i suppose much like the curiosity that makes me wonder at sharknado franchise at just how long and how ridiculous these things can go before they give it up
movies,not_removed,i dont care for it looks like over the top fun
movies,not_removed,i dont have any
movies,not_removed,well it seems to be doing well the bear with the minigun seems to have sold people
movies,not_removed,no need to get the blu ray or dvd just watch this this makes the movie
movies,not_removed,because is like watching your mother be burned at the stake
movies,not_removed,in movies yes
movies,not_removed,recently watched loved jason statham action
movies,not_removed,coincidence if i recall its in the book so its in the movie
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,daniel radcliffe did something similar with harry potter in now you see me also he muses on how he practised magic as a child then he grew up and discovered the real magic science got a chuckle out of me but thats it because oooh boy what a boring film
movies,not_removed,this is even better in the excellent german dub because jeff daniels is dubbed by wolfgang condrus who is also the voice of elrond in the lotr dubs
movies,not_removed,cracks me up every time i watch that scene reminds me of when avatar came out the skinny nerd scientist in the movie was also in the tv show bones in the tv show him and his friends are so stroked and are going to go watch the film
movies,not_removed,i dig meta references in movies when im stoned too
movies,not_removed,because op doesnt provide the actual reference kristin wiig discovers that something is called project elrond and asks why it was named that sean bean explains that it was a secret meeting others then tell her that it is a lord of the rings reference
movies,not_removed,so a clip or the quote would be nice
movies,not_removed,especially when he first tells kristen wiig that elrond refers to the fact that their meeting is secret and she asks him how does he know that and he just looks at her like because i was there
movies,not_removed,woah
movies,not_removed,cant believe that went over my head when i saw the film
movies,not_removed,the council of elrond as a metaphor for a secret meeting has been around since lord of the rings was published this is a stretch
movies,not_removed,yeah its in the book the jessica chastain character replies with you guys never get laid do you
movies,not_removed,maybe they cast him for that specific line to be valid
movies,not_removed,just like when people got all shitty about hollywood inserting a chinese scene into the film
movies,not_removed,thank
movies,not_removed,sorry im not very good at magic
movies,not_removed,this is always whats me get in this scene
movies,not_removed,thats simply crossmarketing as both titles are fox properties
movies,not_removed,exact description of how this went down lol
movies,not_removed,soyeah
movies,not_removed,no jessica chastain commander lewis is on the ares spaceship basically the whole movie its kristen wiig annie who says that shes the nasa spokesperson or something
movies,not_removed,fuck me what a hacky line
movies,not_removed,you
movies,not_removed,ah good call thanks for the correction
movies,not_removed,cause you know thats not exactly what someone would say in real life right
movies,not_removed,if you told people that exchange was from the big bang theory theyd roll their eyes and sneer about how hacky it is nerdy shit is popular now jokes about not getting laid because you like lord of the rings are fucking dated then again this is the book that uses pirateninjas as a funny quirky phrase
movies,not_removed,dated or not people still say things like that so its not really a hacky line its just something people might say i could see it if the author tried to force something in there that no one in real life would do but this kind of exchange happens all the time
movies,not_removed,agreed fantastic film
movies,not_removed,i actually just watched this last night its fantastic i could easily see many moments that tarantino must really love the shot with the guy floating halfway in the ocean of his own blood is one of the most beautiful sequences of violence ive ever seen and that really meta subplot of the guy writing a manga of the story as it happens and this movie is based on a manga is a really interesting storytelling device i know a lot of people on this sub love tarantino so i highly recommend it to any of you wanting to see where he gets a lot of his inspiration from especially for kill bill the barnes noble criterion sale is coming up next week and their release also includes its sequel which ive not seen
movies,not_removed,i just ordered a really nice dvd set of these two movies cant wait to see them﻿
movies,not_removed,wow this looks amazing thank you for posting this will be watching asap
movies,not_removed,tarantino is brainless copypaster﻿
movies,not_removed,its not like he said he came up with all of that stuff he said kill bill was an ode to these movies
movies,not_removed,rkalkimauty is a brainless shitposter fixed
movies,not_removed,trrf
movies,not_removed,thank god ive been waiting for this
movies,not_removed,glad to hear that
movies,not_removed,i might be alone on this but i thought all the xmen movies were awful both future and past sure jackman stewart and fassbender were great casting choices and played their roles brilliantlybut thats all the strength in the series casting and brand recognition the new first class trilogy is being heralded as a better take but its still awful i think i hope singer steps away and new writers and directors and even casting get a chance to bring this fantastic universe to life i mean the avengers are marvels big cinematic success story but xmen always had better characters deeper meanings a more rich world and much more fun and complex action i know everyones tired of reboots but i hope this one gets rebooted again and done right this time with httpcomicsalliancecomxmenjimleeomegaredwolverinemarvel
movies,not_removed,all these movies must cut into his quality child fucking time
movies,not_removed,despite liking apocalypse i would like for more mathew vaughn style directing and less singer i hated when singer came back and frankly i dont think days of future past is anywhere as good as people claim
movies,not_removed,fewer movies more pretty twenty somethings for bryan
movies,not_removed,and you ca n see it back when dofp wa the latest film the only xmen films he made were all good i cant believe it when i saw it how he managed to drop the ball i wasnt even expecting it to be that bad you can tell just from the movie there was no longer that emotional touch and love and care this is the right choice
movies,not_removed,how does it stack up against bvs
movies,not_removed,better more coherent but the characters seem a little flat and they shove some exposition in just so non comic book fans can follow along which they needed some but not to the extent they did
movies,not_removed,i dont want to stop you from watching it if you dont want to but it definitely did go edgier its not the nolan grittieness nor the old school neon but its definitely different the same way that batman kills in bvs is a marked departure from canon so does this movie in smaller ways
movies,not_removed,glad you enjoyed it it seems that even if people arent much of a fan of musicals in general have found enjoyment with the movie i also agree that the movie had such incredible music and art design especially since the directorwriter has such an extensive background in music and the passion from it shows so much onto the screen
movies,not_removed,for someone that isnt into musicals how is it thought about taking the fiancé but neither of us are big musical fans
movies,not_removed,i went and saw this movie yesterday and enjoyed it a lot im not sure i agree with the massive amount of hype it got but it was a lot of fun like you say the movie was very pretty and the music was excellent i had personally hoped for a bit more dancing but still enjoyed it a lot
movies,not_removed,i went in thinking id enjoy it but didnt realise how much more id enjoy it once the film started yes i was smitten by the music oh lovely
movies,not_removed,i thought all of the songs were awful
movies,not_removed,glad you enjoyed it it seems that even if people arent much of a fan of musicals in general have found enjoyment with the movie i wonder if a subset of those people have never watched a good musical i know that was my perception years ago and then i watched a few that turned me around
movies,not_removed,i dont particularly care for musicals either but as a film it is extremely entertaining and enjoyable the technical aspects of the film are just incredible music is amazing acting is great and the story is just very inspiring and full of heart
movies,not_removed,i enjoyed it and certainly appreciated the look of the film and the movie i did feel the editing was a bit disjointed worse and im going to get railed on for this the casting was not right i like gosling and stone as much as anyone theyre talented actors they are not singersdancers gosling pulled it off better than stone but overall it was like watching amateur dinner theatre in some scenes and no the clumsiness wasnt endearing or an expression of vulnerability as ive seen it described by some
movies,not_removed,that could definitely be a reason but i think what makes this film so special is the balance it has between story and musical numbers especially during its act where the songs take a seat back and let the story progress naturally representing where they are in their relationship the first and last acts were fantastical and wonderful while the second act was sobering and realistic its just an incredible movie overall and i could talk about it for hours
movies,not_removed,im not going to rail on you for that opinion as i do understand it however i do not fully agree from what i understand both gosling and stone are decent singersdancers and gosling learned the piano pieces for this movie they acquitted themselves nicely but you could see that they are not professional dancers and that it kinda limited what the movie could do in terms of dancing especially the tap number it was alright but comparing it to the dancing of gene kelly fred astaire ginger rogers etc shows the massive difference in their dancing skill
movies,not_removed,flags of our fathers
movies,not_removed,if you liked flags i recommend the book flyboys by the same author i read both found flags to be a bit dry slow flyboys was a fascinating look into the japanese psyche leading up to wwii as well as a pretty badass war story about one of our former presidents
movies,not_removed,i liked both a good amount but i agree letters has the edge for me it was such a unique take and i found it really interesting however i also liked how flags showed the soldiers coming home and more of the story than just on the island
movies,not_removed,i had no interest in either movie when they came out and havent seen either i wont be seeing either just no interest at all
movies,not_removed,why would you even comment how did this further the discussion

movies,not_removed,david lynch i went to meet george lucas who had offered me the third star wars to direct and ive never even really liked science fiction i like elements of it but it needs to be combined with other genres and obviously star wars was totally georges thing edit heres another good article on the subject from the nerdist httpnerdistcomwhatifdavidlynchhaddirectedreturnofthejedi
movies,not_removed,simple and eerie makes me more excited to see the movie
movies,not_removed,this early on i wouldnt mind a complete reboot you shouldnt start with an angry bitter batman its not earned affleck ages as time goes on so the scope of batman stories are going to be diminished over time i say this in response to anyone saying that the dark knight returns features a bitter angry batman yes it does but its a comic book where in fact that character has stories that are still being told today
movies,not_removed,baseless speculation the thread
movies,not_removed,pointless remark the comment
movies,not_removed,if you dont mind paying for a version you already kinda own you can buy the collectors edition which includes the ultimate and theatrical cut on bluray along with the hardcover graphic novel and the motion comic about long i think it costs something like the theatrical cut is on dvd sorry about that its a great collectors edition though so if you are a big fan id recommmed it especially if you havent read the comic yet as its included in two different forms
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,the directors cut is better it is all you will need
movies,not_removed,i think it does i already own the dc dvd and i bought watchmen the end is nigh game for which came with the movie was hoping it was the theatrical but it was directors cut so now i have two copies of the movie lol
movies,not_removed,theatrical was only on dvd if i remember correctly but i have to say the directors cut is far superiori hated the film when i saw it in theaters but gave it another chance when the directors cut came out and loved it
movies,not_removed,i own that version
movies,not_removed,i think rewatching the theatrical cut helped me love it and i fell in love with that version the extra scenes in the dc are cool and it is a good film id just like to have the original as well mainly to show friends i dont want to have to start them on a hour special edition for their first time
movies,not_removed,and you were looking for the theatrical my bad mustve misread or something i just ordered this version off of amazon
movies,not_removed,i know the dc is the favorite round these parts but i really prefer the theatrical i think its because ive seen it so many times its the version i fell in love with the added scenes in the dc are good and maybe the film is better but i prefer the tc plus i want to introduce a friend to it and feel they should see the tc first
movies,not_removed,i can understand that like see the movie that everyone saw first then see the extended and added parts
movies,not_removed,yes
movies,not_removed,lala land was an okay feel good movie i didnt regret spending my money on it but it is not the best picture
movies,not_removed,dont think this debate matters why should noncelebrities give a shit about these award ceremonies its not like all the people spending money to see the movies have a say in the decision does having the actor you like win something make you really feel that happy with life or yourself i do believe they tried to diversify for this oscars with the moonlight win but the repetition of diversity starts to give the connotation of add some black people to stay politically correct
movies,not_removed,i take it ya didnt watch the video
movies,not_removed,considering that oscars ratings have been declining for years in a row they are some considerations when it comes to politically charged movies that issues may not stand the test of time
movies,not_removed,

movies,not_removed,when hes had enough of that maybe youll take him to bed to teach him hes alive before he wishes he was dead
movies,not_removed,rdj has the perfect donut face i really believed he was overdosing on jelly donuts when she was carrying him up the stairs just give the man another donut for christs sake
movies,not_removed,love the book love the film james spader is so goddamn awesome
movies,not_removed,honestly i felt as if this movie was little more than a glorified vehicle for the soundtrack
movies,not_removed,for a second reading the comment i thought i was about a weeksdays later sequel rip
movies,not_removed,sadly the only thing i remember about this movie is a review title less than zero less than zero probably unfairly harsh from the sound of it
movies,not_removed,years later damn persistent zombies
movies,not_removed,a lot has changed its now spread to every continent
movies,not_removed,nice try ben affleck
movies,not_removed,i still wish he did his own trilogy first movie based on the long halloween or arkum asylum then the hush storyline could be cool and finally the third film will launch a batman beyond live action move
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,someone on this sub suggested the plot to be like the good the bad and the ugly the good batman the bad deadshot the ugly the joker i think that sounds awesome
movies,not_removed,id love to see an almost arkham origins approach black mask hired deathstroke to kill the bat whilst hes in hiding batman has to find out where black mask is while fending off an onslaught of attacks from deathstoke joker claims to know where he is and gets interrogated but is uncooperative leading to another fight with deathstroke in arkham while the joker watches dunno how it ends
movies,not_removed,ill just settle for it having a plot at all
movies,not_removed,id like to see an adaptation from grant morrisons batman rip and then batman son and then the return of bruce wayne my personal favourite batman comics and definitely my favourite writer
movies,not_removed,hours of bruce and alfred having a discussion on whether he should wear a black suit or a bluish black suit each presenting their arguments with powerpoint slides and colored graphs
movies,not_removed,arkhangelsk asylum would be cool
movies,not_removed,first five minutes batman dies deathstroke takes the camera looks at the audience and announces that wb will no longer be making live action superhero movies and will from now on shift to animation for adaptations forever best movie
movies,not_removed,oh if i could be that lucky lol
movies,not_removed,that would be cool yes
movies,not_removed,i cant wait for the hour directors cut
movies,not_removed,yes it does dam i think i should rewatch that one again i love clint
movies,not_removed,how bout black mask hires deathstroke to kill batman as he is complicating things for him and at the same time black mask is in a gang war with the joker who is still one of the villains like arkham city
movies,not_removed,im still dying to see a hannibal lecter style joker on the other side of bars
movies,not_removed,interesting
movies,not_removed,cool
movies,not_removed,but having the turf war going on even while hes locked up could be an interesting plot point
movies,not_removed,well last we checked he is still at large with harley im sure they would keep it that way for the solo film
movies,not_removed,i dont know having him be recently re imprisoned in arkham could show his relationship with the place the fact that for every month hes there hes loose for two
movies,not_removed,sounds interesting yes it does
movies,not_removed,you know what mom you know what im gonna get you next christmas a big wooden cross so every time you feel unappreciated for all your sacrifices you can just climb on up and nail yourself to it
movies,not_removed,slipper socks medium
movies,not_removed,funny you bring this up this is my familys christmas movie that we quote all the time and watch every year not only that but we finished watching it about minutes ago i would talk more about what i loved about it but watching black mirror now the ref is a truly unique christmas movie because christmas is just a backdrop no cheesyness about the meaning of christmas
movies,not_removed,i love this movie i watch it every christmas eve everything just works the writing casting it is a simple movie doesnt try to be anything amazing but it all works
movies,not_removed,my favorite and oft quoted line is learys what this family needs is a mute
movies,not_removed,imo the ref is an okay movie with a couple great scenes the therapy scene at the beginning is gold wife at least i go after my dreams spacey to be what someone who takes photographs of lutfisk to prove the nothingness of being no wonder our sons so confused
movies,not_removed,my favorite christmas movie forget a christmas story and its a wonderful life this is my goto every holiday season when i want vulgar humor
movies,not_removed,you dont look like a wong thats because my mother was irish and your father wasnt
movies,not_removed,best christmas film ever what smells like cat piss
movies,not_removed,one of my fave xmas movies i try to watch it every year coozins
movies,not_removed,a very underrated movie i dont know why but my favorite line is when the superintendent of the sons military academy shows up and leary thinks the army is after him what am i fucking oswald for some reason the way he delivers that line cracks me up even just thinking about it
movies,not_removed,its a very underrated christmas movie
movies,not_removed,lady your husband aint dead hea hiding
movies,not_removed,it really is kind of a unique movie and one that doesnt get made often anymore
movies,not_removed,is it on netflix usa
movies,not_removed,such an underrated movie by far it is worth the watch
movies,not_removed,its an okaygood movie but i think that if you want a christmas themed dark comedy watch bad santa
movies,not_removed,i love how even dennis leary is like fuck i hate her and kevin spacey has to hold him back
movies,not_removed,mother can you shut the fuck up for five seconds
movies,not_removed,i wish i could get my wife to watch it
movies,not_removed,black mirror is good enjoy it yeah i totally see that its the formula for a christmas family comedy
movies,not_removed,kevin spacey is very much his character as lester from american beauty and i love it
movies,not_removed,who gives a rats asssss how i am doing wheres gussy honey your husband is not dead hes hiding
movies,not_removed,yes yes
movies,not_removed,hehe yeah the look on his face is so funny and spacey is just like i know but its not worth it i know loan sharks who are more forgiving than you your husband aint dead lady hes hidin
movies,not_removed,too many great lines my dad hated comedies and loved this film he nearly fell over when spacey blasts the tree with the poker excuse me excuse me excuse me but the corpse still has the floor whats your name fuck you thats my name lady i swear to god you hit that kid one more time and im going to stick that pigs head right up your ass
movies,not_removed,hahahahahahaha i totally forgot about that line i watched this movie so many times back in the day

movies,not_removed,thank you this was so hyped i found it unwatchable boring shame really
movies,not_removed,isnt it the most expensive flop in history
movies,not_removed,besides sofia coppola what didnt you like about part
movies,not_removed,i guess i had very high expectations i wouldnt say its a terrible movie but its a weak movie as the thread demanded the movie felt forced and it was too as the studio demanded coppola to make a sequel and in the first two i could just feel that the director poured his heart and soul into making them and the third one was just a rush trying to get over with it all the movie had to no balance and it felt like a mess and thats what makes the godfather pt significally weak when it shares the names of the maybe two most popular american classics but i will say this its not the directors fault its the studios
movies,not_removed,the writer of this article implied the nice guys was aiming at three stooges type comedy what
movies,not_removed,i read the list expecting to have to defend batman v superman again then i saw they included the nice guys on it and immediately realized that the writer is on some serious drugs edit have to defend not hate to defend stupid typing is hard
movies,not_removed,never saw a single movie on this list but im a bit surprised to see the bfg on here a spielberg film based on a dahl book spectacular failure now i kind of want to see it
movies,not_removed,do people still take salon seriously
movies,not_removed,captain fantastic is his number worst film of the year this dude clearly missed the point of the film someone should take away his movie critic credentials
movies,not_removed,i am glad to see captain fantastic get the ire it deserves
movies,not_removed,rpolitics does
movies,not_removed,failed to deliver on promise not allaround worst edit i agree he missed the point of the film just clarifying the point of the list
movies,not_removed,though it also sounds like they fundamentally misunderstood the movie
movies,not_removed,i likened the big fight in civil war to a martial arts film where the actual fighting is secondary to the disagreement itself no one is expected to die but heres just a fun piece of choreography to play out the conflict the film was aware of this and had fun with the various characters abilities before switching back to its more serious tone as the plot moved on
movies,not_removed,this is why i personally consider the raid movies to be the pinnacle of movie fights theyre highly stylized while at the same time grounded enough so that you feel the characters are in danger as the fights progress you see wounds opening up and characters getting fatigued by the end of the final fight in raid the kitchen floors and walls are covered in blood theres broken shit everywhere and the protagonist can barely stand
movies,not_removed,when you compare modern major films to something like game of thrones much of this makes sense like the mountain vs oberyn for those that havent read the books watching that shit was suspenseful it couldve gone either way and both have huge consequences on the story theres a lot to be invested in big superhero films theres hardly a threat the main characters arent going to be killed and the suspense is diminished long before the fights begin theres barely an impact even in a smaller easier to manage scope like the daredevil show the fighting is close very physical and each hit feels like they matter but ultimately we know daredevil will eventually get out of it still we dont know when a bad fight could put him out of serious commission for a few episodes so theres still some weight to it all i havent felt anything like that in any major marvel film and its a shame because so much of those movies are filled with actiony fight scenes still need to see civil war because winter soldier had some of that weight behind those scenes
movies,not_removed,i think you have a valid point regarding the matrix trilogy in that the audience doesnt really feel invested in the consequences of the battle however civil war was pretty clear in its message that actions fights have consequences if you are trying to view fight scenes as a form of character development then there are plenty of recent examples that fit the criteria creed stands out in my mind as a film that really shows outcomedependance on each of his fights i would argue that creed would have been much better suited as a series rather than a movie but thats beside the point
movies,not_removed,tony zhous video on how jackie chan edits action scenes is really insightful into why it seems like the action in many modern movies is boring﻿
movies,not_removed,yeah the best fight scenes are still from hong kong cinema jackie chan jet li and recently donnie yen had some of the best
movies,not_removed,the video does make a good point about fight scenes in current films especially the comic book movies theres no real stake at hand we know no one is going to die get permanently damaged or really suffering from pain superman mos is a great example zod and superman just flying and punching each other although there was so much going on the screen it was boring because they didnt seem like they were hurting each other at all great examples would be kill bill and the matrix in you do actually see the soldiers get killed in the matrix agent smith clearly outmatches neo and neo does suffer during the fight sequences in kill bill as powerful as the bride is she does have a hard time fighting the people on her hit list and she can die just as easily edit words
movies,not_removed,hes right most fight scenes in movies this days dont look like fighting they are more like some karatebalett they all do same moves and punch somewhere in the air just watch tvshow arrow everyone can learn fighting in this show in no time even the skinniest teenager girl with no muscles and kick tons of bigbadguys and of the fights start with a point landing all the kicks and moves they do are to make it looking good not to hurt the enemies boring
movies,not_removed,fight scenes are always unrealistic in movies
movies,not_removed,i think the bourne films are good examples of fight scenes done right while some may not like the amphetamine editing they do look and feel like real fights chaotic bursts of desperate frenzied violence using anything within reach to gain the upper hand
movies,not_removed,this video is hogwash you have slight points about no damage but to say people are checking their phones makes you insane i get hype af still
movies,not_removed,youre making a mistake
movies,not_removed,in a lot of superhero movie sequences everything is framed so fast i actually dont know whats happened but essentially the guy who made this video is right invulnerable individuals squaring off against each other is actually quite boring its just play fighting
movies,not_removed,another big problem these days is that we cannot see the action movies like the raid and jackie chan films work because we can see the few fight scenes in the korean film a bittersweet life are excellent too the camera allows us to see the movement properly heck even simple things like a simple footchase is more enjoyable when we can see it an example is the film no way out great chase scene with no shaky cams mostly still cameras with slow pans when needed
movies,not_removed,i actually dont have the slightest as to what he is talking about he is dead wrong when it comes to civil war is entire justification for his argument is that when the fighting started in civil war movie goers were bored and talking about other things as if this was fact no one was doing this the hell what a stupid video
movies,not_removed,ive always admired this fight scene because it realistically shows what would happen if one guy was trained and the other wasnt
movies,not_removed,agreed you dont need all four criticisms he ends the video with just the last two the first two could apply to any jackie chan movies i never expect jackies character to get seriously hurt nor do i ever learn anything new about him but theyre extremely fun to watch because the choreography is entertaining and like the video says he shows vulnerability and victory defeating others so i dont want heros to stop lifting cars but i do want one to do it easily while another struggles to to it thats enough of a demonstration of vulnerability for me as for the scene he shows in the video i think showing black panthers claws slice bucky successfully would help to reestablish buckys level of vulnerability
movies,not_removed,rama doesnt really get fatigued in any significant way the entire end of raid he just runs a gauntlet and never gets tired sure he gets bloodied but his technique never really falters in a noticeable way honestly the raid movies are a good argument against this video their fight scenes are interesting in and of themselves as tableauxs of superb stunt and camerawork could easily watch them alone and theyd still be interesting
movies,not_removed,great movies but especially the second one does not feel remotely realistic especially when hammer girl and bat boy entered the scene it started to feel more like a comicanime adaptation just without base material and i was not afraid for rama at any point also the damage the fighters apparently take and the effect on their actual performance does not really seem to be correlated like says the raid movies are more of a counterpoint i was never in doubt about the outcome of a fight but i still loved every second of them
movies,not_removed,well those guys are actual fighters arent they afaik they broke a lot of bones and stuff during the shoot i think western film makers want to avoid that by cutting away from the hits
movies,not_removed,when you compare modern major films to something like game of thrones much of this makes sense like the mountain vs oberyn for those that havent read the books watching that shit was suspenseful i dont watch got anymore but that chapter is easily my favorite it was so awesome and now i understand why
movies,not_removed,this is what movies are missing nowadays yes we know the hero is almost assuredly gonna win so the fight scenes need to be progressing the characters arcs and not just be a fight its like what plinkett discusses in the phantom menace review the fight between maul and the jedi might look cooler but it doesnt have any true weight to it heck a major character does die in that fight and it still doesnt feel like it has meaning we know are characters are going to win so the fun in the fight scene is seeing how this fight is gonna affect their growth as a character
movies,not_removed,thats why all the superhero films are so fucking boring
movies,not_removed,i havent gotten into game of thrones yet and ive enjoyed every marvel movie but i completely agree id love to see them steal the aspects of not having a title character and introducing an overwhelming amount of characters so you can snuff the life out of them unexpectedly the stakes can only believably go so high if you dont do that
movies,not_removed,for the lazy
movies,not_removed,asian martial arts make the best fight scenes theres ton of action its exciting and its very stylistic i wish hollywood films would involve asian fight choreography more often like the matrix or kill bill
movies,not_removed,the mos fight scene ends with superman having to take the life of zodhow is there nothing at stake superman had to compromise his beliefs to save the lives of a family
movies,not_removed,the fighting from bvs was the truth tho batman clearing that room was some of the best shit ive seen in a while from a superhero film going from bvs to civil war was just a huge downgrade in regards to fightingaction
movies,not_removed,sher khan was pretty menacing in the jungle book
movies,not_removed,ice age
movies,not_removed,general zod from man of steel
movies,not_removed,honestly i think choreography is the most important part i just recently rewatched drunken master and any of the fights particularly the last one are amazing and much better than of fight scenes from the last decade but vulnerabilty is not always necessary for example there is this anime called hokuto no ken which is about a world where everything is solved with martial arts where the main character looks like mel gibsonand he easily beats everyone in most episodes there is almost never any sense of danger for the main character and yet the battles are entertaining as hell the situations end up being so absurd and the main character so badass and cool since kenshiro the main character was inspired by american action movies and ends most fights with one liners and cool moves again there is almost never any sense of dangers for kenshiro yet the battles are good
movies,not_removed,you can really make that argument for of movie fights out there of course the hero isnt going to lose
movies,not_removed,yes its a documentary
movies,not_removed,paraphrasing grrm has said that if the characters you like never die then theres no point to any of it it makes you more invested in the ones still living and give them the very real weight of being able to be killed off
movies,not_removed,deul of tge fates killed qui gon and shaped obi wan was a good one imho
movies,not_removed,ive rewatched the guardians of the galaxy since i saw this video and i dont know if i agree with him anymore about the gotg scene with the kick jackie chan movies are actioncomedy but gotg is actionadventurescificomedy so the gamora vs nebula had to look up that name scene is going for something completely different when i imagine them actually showing the impact im not convinced that in context it would add to the scene more than it distracts from everything else happening in the movie at that point
movies,not_removed,imagine if they hadnt wasted the actors from the raid in star wars for a little cameo and instead made them martial arts mercenaries or even sith assassins or something like that
movies,not_removed,i see what youre saying but im talking in terms of physical combat i meant no stakes in the sense that you never felt superman was ever really in danger you do bring up a good point about superman sacrificing his beliefs though maybe my mos example wasnt the best
movies,not_removed,the first few fights in civil war have a problem with how early they cut and how close they cut to the hits it gets better about it as the movie goes on but its definitely irksome early on
movies,not_removed,ok you said you thought the fights in the raid felt grounded and conveyed a sense of the danger for the protagonist i completely disagree especially the final fights in both movies are a too long and the characters take ridiculous amounts of punishment while hardly slowing down if at all for that reason i never felt that danger you talked about which is what i meant when i said i had no doubt about the outcome of any fight i still really love those movies but they are mostly about the spectacle and not necessarily the climax of a big conflict between two characters the final fights are both against henchmen something that was criticized in the video op posted
movies,not_removed,but now we feel that jon dany arya and tyrion all have plot armor i hope im wrong but i doubt anything will happen to them before the final chapter
movies,not_removed,but why do we as audience members care that qui gon is dead and how does it shape obiwan we never see him reflect or even seem to think about quigon it doesnt effect his abilities as a jedi cause he still goes on to be one of the most important jedi on the council you could say maybe that taking on anakin as a padawan when he wasnt ready is part of anakins downfall but the entire council is already forseeing grave danger in training anakin and they basically all fail to ever see the signs of his turning to the dark side not just obiwan
movies,not_removed,jackie chan movies being action comedy has nothing to do with the way its edited actually showing the impact wouldve made the kick feel stronger its as simple as that
movies,not_removed,rumor is that those guys are some of the knights of ren also donnie yen is in rogue one
movies,not_removed,jackie chan movies being action comedy has nothing to do with the way its edited um what editing is different for every genre emphasis changes depending on what the intended mood and story is
movies,not_removed,but didnt they already appear in the force awakens they were one of the gangs that want to get han solo
movies,not_removed,donnie yen knight of ren one of the ten next to ben who killed his kin
movies,not_removed,yesso
movies,not_removed,they didnt die id imagine that theyll be back for the next movie
movies,not_removed,i think uarafax is trying to make the point that its unlikely that those guys are the knights of ren because they already had roles as mercenaries in the sw universe
movies,not_removed,if the knights only appear wearing their masks it would only be fair to give the guys responsible for making them look like badass fighters a little facetime this could be achieved by having them also appear as characters that dont wear masks i believe the two guys playing arthur dayne and gerold hightower in the tower of joy scene in game of thrones usually do stuntwork as white walkers
movies,not_removed,aaaah now i get your point that would be pretty cool if they could come back in masked roles where they can show their martial arts abilities
movies,not_removed,i think you simply missed the point of the movie entirely because your version is about something completely different
movies,not_removed,thanks for the spoiler alert dick
movies,not_removed,your version sounds so corny and terrible theres a reason you arent making movies man
movies,not_removed,have you seen any other refn films besides drive not to sound condescending but it doesnt sound like you knew what to expect the neon demon falls nicely in line with the rest of his filmography
movies,not_removed,its a good movie your version is not
movies,not_removed,i didnti dont think i will even if i watch it another times this is the second movie i walked out on the first was scary movie
movies,not_removed,youre not missing anything trust me
movies,not_removed,okk who said i want to make movies anyways this is what i would have liked to see instead of this crap
movies,not_removed,it looked and sounded fantastic but the story and characters were boring and horrible
movies,not_removed,thank you for your opinion
movies,not_removed,how did you walk out of it if you commented on how disgusting the ending was
movies,not_removed,thats not your call let him decide that for himself
movies,not_removed,criticizing it is one thing offering the version you did was to borrow a phrase of yours cringeworthy
movies,not_removed,welcome
movies,not_removed,well i stayed long enough to witness it and then i had enough and walked out
movies,not_removed,alrighty you have shit taste in movies then buddy
movies,not_removed,see ya
movies,not_removed,i didnt see this movie i just think you seem like an idiot
movies,not_removed,bye
movies,not_removed,😘
movies,not_removed,thank you for providing me with additional evidence
movies,not_removed,we can do emojis
movies,not_removed,duh 💁
movies,not_removed,madness 💆
movies,not_removed,psychedelically trippy magical battle in a vividly colored astral space background sequences
movies,not_removed,something similar to antman or guardians where itll be a sleeper hit antman is my favorite marvel movie so far i dont expect it to become my favorite but its not gonna be a fiasco like fantastic four
movies,not_removed,something similar to inception grounded tone fantasy premise very unique visuals
movies,not_removed,hopes arent high because the director has only been involved with some below average horror flicks
movies,not_removed,i am expecting to have to watch a ton of youtube videos and read articles to understand all the easter eggs and references made in the movie that went over my head i suspect i shant be alone in that
movies,not_removed,im expectinghoping it will be weird trippy and weird
movies,not_removed,absolutely nothing
movies,not_removed,trailer looked like a combination of the matrix and inception if its half as enjoyable for me as either of those movies ill be happy with it
movies,not_removed,im expecting nothing from it because ive pretty much already decided ill be sitting this one out there were a couple big superhero movies recently that didnt appeal to me but i ended up going to see anyway and i regretted it my first instinct was right and i didnt really care for them im sticking with my gut on this one
movies,not_removed,movie magic s because of the expectations set by inception a visual experience to exceed
movies,not_removed,i know nothing of the character but am looking forward to paprika levels of world bending i will probably be disappointed however
movies,not_removed,quips and mediocrity
movies,not_removed,i was hopeful until i saw in the preview that the old one was going to be a woman now ive lost all faith in the people behind this movie and have no expectations i only hope it isnt as bad as ant man
movies,not_removed,what hollywood did to the fantastic four is enough to make you weep tears of blood
movies,not_removed,antman bad
movies,not_removed,you mean gasp it was yet another fad that was supposed to save cinema
movies,not_removed,in terms of comedic effect this is right up there with rains of castemere and godfathers passacaglia and fugue in c minor during the famous baptism scene
movies,not_removed,nightcrawler
movies,not_removed,wolf of wall street
movies,not_removed,tried to list true bad guys and not antiheros the social network angst i stand alone the king of comedy more cringey than anything a clockwork orange its always sunny a tv show but very awful and neurotic main characters in cold blood wolf of wall street american psycho
movies,not_removed,once upon a time in america if you have hours to spare i highly recommend this masterpiece
movies,not_removed,despicable me
movies,not_removed,what about tarrantinocharacters do they count i mean we usually enter the story at a point where they are in some peril and we end up rooting for them but they are most of the time former killers gangster etc otherwise bad santa and most bill murray lead movies
movies,not_removed,what about the jody hilldanny mcbride group of movies foot fist way and observe and report come to mind more of a petty small despicability
movies,not_removed,there will be blood
movies,not_removed,the player
movies,not_removed,all rom coms
movies,not_removed,naked
movies,not_removed,mos and bvs
movies,not_removed,i bought this movie like years ago and never got around to watching it and gangster crime epics are my favorite how does it hold up to godfather or goodfellas
movies,not_removed,i like it more its a story that takes place from being a kid to an old man it feels more emotional when a something bad happens you really feel for the characters i love gangster movies also its from sergio leone hes the guy who made good bad and the ugly if you dont like that style you probably wont like the movie
movies,not_removed,considering hes made some of my favorite westerns i think ill be fine
movies,not_removed,john wick looked so stupid to me but it turned pretty cool
movies,not_removed,lego movie in fact anything by phil lord and christopher miller cloudy with a chance of meatballs and jump street
movies,not_removed,kingsman
movies,not_removed,every fast and furious movie after the movie tokyo drift i thought people would be sick and tired of watching them but i was wrong
movies,not_removed,when i heard that a movie called hot tub time machine was coming out i thought that it would be hot garbage ended up being hilarious i skipped the sequel as is tradition
movies,not_removed,maybe not bomb but i never thought avatar would be as popular as it was
movies,not_removed,lego movie never bothered to watch the trailers because i was dead certain that it was just a soulless cash grab and toy commercial i was not expecting it to be the incredible animated movie that it ended up being
movies,not_removed,antman for sure i thought paul rudds reputation would be almost ruined afterwards but its success was a pleasant surprise
movies,not_removed,world war z
movies,not_removed,guardians of the galaxy i didnt think that the movie would have done so well because those characters are not known by a lot of people its not like superman or ironman characters and guardians of the galaxy arent established comic book heroes that people know of like how are you going to advertise a talking raccoon and a tree to someone like my mom it ended up making a crap ton of money
movies,not_removed,deadpool after watching both green lantern and ripd i wasnt holding out much hope
movies,not_removed,ace ventura pet detective it looked dumb as hell in the commercials but for some reason everybody loved it
movies,not_removed,i think too many people are confusing thinking a film would be bad with thinking a film would fail financially in this thread
movies,not_removed,the legend of tarzan i was sure that this one could have never grossed more than million dollars it looked boring and completely unnecessary after watching it i still have the same opinion the opening weekend was surprisingly big and it ended up grossing around million its obviously not a hit but it didnt bomb
movies,not_removed,the angry birds movie
movies,not_removed,i remember thinking the dawn of the dead remake would not work mainly because of my love for the first one i was fucking adamant still saw it opening day and it was kinda great
movies,not_removed,star wars more a critical bomb i just felt the prequels killed the joy i used have for star wars and honesty months out i had not even seen the trailer then tickets went on sale and im not totally sure what change but i was like fine i will go if for no other reason then the fact if i dont it will be spoiled about into the film i was again
movies,not_removed,antman like i was sure itd be the start of the marvel decline and it wound up being one of the more refreshing movies theyve done
movies,not_removed,jurassic world
movies,not_removed,pirates of the carribean i mean its a movie based on a theme park ride ffs
movies,not_removed,mad max fury road thought the trailer was pretty cheesy with the big letters and it would be a tough sell to newer viewers who havent seen the original
movies,not_removed,madagascar everything about its advertising made it seem cheesy and one of those bmovie animated dreamworks films that go under the radar i really ended up enjoying it and it did great at the box office and they are still making filmsspin offs from it
movies,not_removed,legend of tarzan still didnt break even but made way more than projected
movies,not_removed,maleficent i thought it would be weird also i did think that angelina jolie wouldnt be a big draw at the box office i was proven wrong the martian this was before i saw the trailer i was like ugh another space movie i doubt this can top interstellar it turned out to be as good as interstellar
movies,not_removed,guardians of the galaxy im not sure if anyone expected that
movies,not_removed,titanic at a young age i just didnt see the point in watching a history lesson every comedian had so many jokes about cameron sinking his money into a movie which was bound to take a sharp nose dive they didnt understand the point of making a movie with a known conclusion he made a movie about a love story and allowed it to end more realistically he appealed to a board audiences
movies,not_removed,sharknado
movies,not_removed,norbit it looked awful sure enough though it was number in the box office for a week or two
movies,not_removed,frozen
movies,not_removed,i didnt expect suicide squad to be as much of a hit as it has been i expected to drop pretty quickly but its managed to hold on nicely
movies,not_removed,resident evil i expected a terrible video game movie and was pleasantly surprised that it was a very competent zombie movie im even more surprised that each movie has made more money than the last and only the second one is actually terrible theyre very well done b movie b movies
movies,not_removed,zombieland
movies,not_removed,rise of an empire
movies,not_removed,the pacifier did better than i thought it would looked like a stinker to me
movies,not_removed,hot fuzz the trailers made it look incredibly stupid but it was such a pleasant surprise
movies,not_removed,to add my own own example finding dory who cares about the yappy fish from the first movie apparently lots of people lol
movies,not_removed,guardians of the galaxy i thought they were really scraping the bottom of the barrel for new super hero movies and it turned out its now one of my favorite super hero movies
movies,not_removed,home from dreamworks
movies,not_removed,men in black i swear the actors saved that movie from being a joke on paper its terrible its silly over the top and a fairly lame story but somehow it works
movies,not_removed,guardians of the galaxy look i love comics and read em all the time and even id never heard of these characters
movies,not_removed,the expendables big dumbcheesy action movie got how many sequels
movies,not_removed,anchorman i loved it walked out and called my friends told them to see it immediately because i didnt think it would be in theaters more than a few weeks hadnt seen a relatively successful movie with that much weird humor since billy madison
movies,not_removed,looking back at recent movies the dark knight was one no one had any faith heath ledger and was insanely confused how he could be picked for the joker oddly enough iron man one it was the first marvel movie in the new mu that was good nolans batman movies were the only ones at the time that were any good hulk terrible man of steel terrible and they chose to go with semi underwhelming iron man boggled the mind at the time
movies,not_removed,ant man comes to mind also after all the bad press i didnt think batman v superman would make it to million
movies,not_removed,jurassic world was pretty surprising for how bad to mediocre it was in the end
movies,not_removed,suicide squad
movies,not_removed,define successful because there are a ton of bad movies that make a boat load of money simply because of star power
movies,not_removed,avatar
movies,not_removed,hot tub time machine i was surprised it got sequels
movies,not_removed,blown away
movies,not_removed,i definitely though hansel gretel witch hunters would be trashed at the box office but it was one of the highest grossing films that year
movies,not_removed,deadpool and guardians of the galaxy i love each property i just didnt think they would do well at the box office
movies,not_removed,the bayformers movies
movies,not_removed,why are these threads always dominated by movies released in the last two years ill go with zootopia
movies,not_removed,pirates of the caribbean pirate movies had a long history of failure and it was based on a theme park attraction i just couldnt imagine it doing well not to mention the fact that the original trailer wasnt that great deppsjack sparrows charm in the film was hard to realize in the trailer it was full of cliche punchlines and the cgi looked rough to say the least all of this had me convinced it would be on dvd in no time i was wrong and was personally very surprised by how much i enjoyed it heres the original trailer for those who dont remember
movies,not_removed,does edge of tomorrow count the previews looked terrible and i was absolutely certain it was gonna be a huge bomb i would hate however i saw it on a whim after hearing all the positive buzz and i actually really liked it it still didnt really do all that good financially but at the very least it was a lot better than i expected it to be
movies,not_removed,world war z so many rewrites and way over budget but turned out to be both enjoyable and finically successful
movies,not_removed,now you see me
movies,not_removed,i was sure the jungle book was gonna bomb tommorowland did why not that but it was exremely succesfull thought kids nowadays only liked animation but guess not
movies,not_removed,titanic thought it would be the next waterworld level bomb but we all know how it actually turned out
movies,not_removed,i was sure the new jungle book would make back its budget but i was also sure it was not going to become the grossing movie of the year so i didnt think it would bomb but i didnt think it would be so successful
movies,not_removed,jurassic world
movies,not_removed,xmen first class preproduction had some interesting stories come out of it as well as the production itself but the end product was pretty good
movies,not_removed,mars attacks for me
movies,not_removed,gravity i didnt think the movie would bomb just thought it would be a modest success with maybe million or so if it was lucky did not expect it to make million in north america alone
movies,not_removed,guardians of the galaxy i thought it was doomed to fail turns out its one of the best super hero movies and made like a billion dollars i love james gunn movies too but things like bradly cooper voicing rocket and a pro wrestling playing a main character had me worried but nope both super great
movies,not_removed,lets see if that new power rangers movie surprise me like that
movies,not_removed,the new mad max it did not bomb and it was incredible
movies,not_removed,fury road i was expecting a die hard robocop remake level of quality and box office suffice to say i was way off
movies,not_removed,ant man soon as edgar wright was kicked offquit the project i was like this movie is gonna be fucked then they replaced him with the director of yes man and the break up and i was like this movie is totally gonna be average at best walked out loving it i will say a lot of the writing shows it still very much had wrights hands all over it but if you didnt tell me edgar didnt direct it i wouldnt have known i will say looking at the new writers on the follow up im back to thinking they are fucked for ant man and the wasp wright is an a level talent and really they have a b level director at best with at best a c level writing team
movies,not_removed,snakes on a plane
movies,not_removed,cars
movies,not_removed,jump street
movies,not_removed,whenever i hear bomb i think of it in a successful wayam i the only one
movies,not_removed,going back in time many thought titanic was going to bomb did with me still havent watched
movies,not_removed,not bomb exactly but i didnt think the dark knight wouldve been as succesful as it has batman begins boxoffice was mediocre for a batman movie so i thought before seeing the ledgers joker that people wouldnt be so interested in a begins sequel because of the dark tone i ended up being wrong and it became my favorite movie
movies,not_removed,toy story
movies,not_removed,probably because it has so much history to develop and characters and keanu fucking reeves
movies,not_removed,on paper it sounds dumb in action its arguably one of the most genuine action packed movies out there i think what sold me was simply the trailer
movies,not_removed,jump street was hilarious i missed it and forced myself to watch it on netflix i like cheap humour sometimes movies are just meant for simply entertainment those kids have figured out how to do mindless comedies
movies,not_removed,making movies way better than they should be is kind of their thing its why i still have high hopes for the young han solo movie
movies,not_removed,true especially with a title like the lego movie they didnt put much thought into it lol
movies,not_removed,matt vaughn knows what hes doing
movies,not_removed,i was going to say the exact same thing when i first saw the trailer i didnt realise it was matthew vaugn in the directors chair
movies,not_removed,kingsman was advertised as a serious spy movie at least thats how i saw the ads when i finally got around to seeing the movie i loved it because i wasnt expecting any of what i saw
movies,not_removed,i thought the same thing because i had no idea who matt vaughn was when kingsman first came out all i thought was here is some stupid action movie that cannot hope to compete with marvels success so happy to be proven wrong and huge fan of vaughn now
movies,not_removed,i liked tokyo drift mostly because of han to be honest
movies,not_removed,they are a guilty pleasure to be honest i dont take them seriously so they are a fun watch s seriously the rocks character flexes off a cast on his arm and also rips a turret off a drone which he uses as a gattling gun you cant take that seriously but its enjoyable
movies,not_removed,along came the rock
movies,not_removed,fast furious for me boy was i wrong
movies,not_removed,td i felt cashed in on the craze but did it in a tactful way just brang back characters from the frist movie and felt more like it was a bad sunday afternoon buddy movie you wouldnt mind watching dye football offseason the newer ones are just action movies now more in common with spymilitarysuperhero movies
movies,not_removed,feel the same way about transformers
movies,not_removed,im still surprised at how well they did and are among the highest grossing movies iirc i guess it proves that milking a series with endless sequels can be profitable
movies,not_removed,that series kind of reinvented itself enough as it went along to still feel fresh
movies,not_removed,i like all the oddnumbered ones with particular hatred for and for me the original are about actual car stuff and the characters whereas are just action movies that happen to have cars in them is a really fun heist movie and im sort of meh about but are just the worst things i think i saw one time at a double feature being followed by a cgi kids movie called epic or something like that which i enjoyed far more
movies,not_removed,sequel is better than horrible bosses
movies,not_removed,i honestly think it was because the thing at least from where i live that movie was promoted as hell to see with glasses
movies,not_removed,this movie gets a lot of crap but the first time i watched it i loved it yes it has the same story line as fern gully pocahontas dances with wolves and last samurai but it was still a fun and awesome movie plus visually it was great
movies,not_removed,loved the movie but it because of the visuals and lvl of detail the acting is par and plot is predictable those also no memorable line from the movie either
movies,not_removed,yeh i same i could tell it would do well but i didnt think it would do as well as it did then i saw and i thought it fucking sucked and i was all christ its titanic all over again but without an awesome second half and no awesome billy zane i have a child seriously what a scumbag
movies,not_removed,ah yes the blue aliens i was thinking about the last airbender would be great if they ever made a film for that
movies,not_removed,how would it bomb though like so many kids would drag their parents along even if it was just a cash grab
movies,not_removed,i was hesitant about antman until i heard michael pena was really funny i gave it a chance and so glad that i did
movies,not_removed,agreed i remember a very old snl sketch where supermanbill murray yes it was that old was hosting a cocktail party for other super heroes one of the jokes was that none of the other heroes knew who antman was and they were all making fun of his powers that didnt seem like a very good candidate for a bigbudget super hero movie
movies,not_removed,never understood why people were skeptical marvel hadnt made a single bad film at the time and antman is one of the most important marvel characters i assumed theyd do him justice
movies,not_removed,i was so excited for this movie then sooo worried about it when edgar wright left it turned out to be a really fun and funny movie i still wouldve loved to see wrights final vision but you could definitely see his fingerprints on some of the scenes
movies,not_removed,ive watched every marvel movie but got bored with antman and stopped watching halfway through
movies,not_removed,i dont understand the succes of the film i guess its just the marvel name and paul rudd i thought this was the weakest of all marvel films in recent years but even the critics rated it fresh afaik edit seems like this is the wrong opinion
movies,not_removed,antman was a such a disappointment it wasnt bad but it was the most painfully average film i can remember all the way through i couldnt help but mourn the film we couldve gotten if marvel hadnt kept breathing down edgar wrights neck
movies,not_removed,seems a prerequisite to liking it was having no knowledge of the books it was based off like me thought it was ok watched it because i saw a making of documentary on the vfx used for the zombie swarms clever stuff
movies,not_removed,guardians had a really solid marketing campaign though too it embraced the weirdness of the movie and i think thats what drew people to see it it got people talking
movies,not_removed,people overestimate many comic book heroes imo sure the general audience knew superman spiderman and batman but guys like iron man captain america thor or hulk no they used to be pretty obscure for people who werent comic book fans
movies,not_removed,like how are you going to advertise a talking raccoon and a tree to someone like my mom its kind of funny you said that because guardians of the galaxy is the only super hero movie my mom likes
movies,not_removed,and then theres the fact that those unknown characters are played by nobodies lol its not a bad movie but im still surprised it was such a hit
movies,not_removed,everyone who saw that trailer in the theatre marked their calendar for guardians of the galaxy that was one hell of a trailer i didnt know anything about them but was sold on the trailer as something i needed to see fortunately for the film it lived up to the trailer
movies,not_removed,agreed i knew who the guardians of the galaxy were but had no idea how they would pull this off they did it though and i loved the movie
movies,not_removed,an r rated movie starring box office poison from a studio with little audience trust i wouldnt have green lit it
movies,not_removed,im glad i was right about ripd i mean its obviously men in black with ghosts you shouldnt be able to play mad libs with a movie plot and have it be successful
movies,not_removed,it was pretty low budget seemed kinda low risk high reward
movies,not_removed,i keep seeing people say deadpool was such a risk but can i ask how it was at all a risk its a superhero film connected to an already established franchise filled with r rated jokes with a character with an already established massive following
movies,not_removed,i dont see how it could have ever bombed the hype was too much i could see expecting it to suck but not bomb bvs and ss didnt bomb they just sucked
movies,not_removed,deadpool is a character that people are obsessed with because he is a joke character hes goofy edgy and breaks the fourth wall so people love that wit similarly to will ferrell and seth rogan comedies for similar reasons its why suicide squad wouldnt flop harley quinn people are obsessed with her she is far from the best female comic book character but shes halfgood halfbad witty and hot those two characters themselves and their good casting are why both deadpool and suicide squad could never be flops
movies,not_removed,for some reason for all the reasons such a great movie
movies,not_removed,it really speaks to jim carrys talent as an actor
movies,not_removed,shikaka
movies,not_removed,in a perfect world those would be the same thing i think it is good to treat them that way anyhow otherwise the question becomes much to complicated
movies,not_removed,oh god i still cringe when i think of that movie being made
movies,not_removed,just watched that with my daughters the other day i was pleasantly surprised
movies,not_removed,doesnt make it any less of a blatant cash grab it could have been any film they just used the angry birds brand name to sell
movies,not_removed,hell yeah i didnt like the sequel as much however
movies,not_removed,i think making the zombies fast runners made the movie much more scary it was the first time id seen any zombie movie where they werent slow
movies,not_removed,this might be the best thing zak snyder has ever done
movies,not_removed,i figured tfa would be successful but when people started saying that it was going to be the highest grossing film of all time i called shenanigans boy was i wrong
movies,not_removed,i dont think even the prequels ruined the pre hype for me from the moment hamill fisher and ford signed on i knew we were in good hands that movie had zero reason to suck if it was bad it was gonna be a total misfire on accident i can pick out numerous aspects of i ii and iii that are wrong choices vii thankfully panned out
movies,not_removed,because it was a carbon copy of anh
movies,not_removed,so it really was a good movie i may check it out sometime lol
movies,not_removed,it seems like every time they do a movie featuring littleknown superheros we all think itll be the start of the decline somehow it hasnt happened yet marveldisney has a very specific formula for these movies disney in particular knows exactly how to make lots of money
movies,not_removed,my expectations were low due to the trailer but it actually paid off okay
movies,not_removed,i cant believe it fooled so many people
movies,not_removed,i remember drudge feeding into its own spin far right rags tend to resent mainstream hollywood and post early headlines about it being a bomb because midnight screenings werent netting as much as expected in some regions i remember the main page had pratt on his raptor cycle and the text said jurassic bombneedless to say after opening night they didnt run anymore stories about it
movies,not_removed,i honestly believe that movie was carried by johnny depp i think if he wasnt in it or he had acted the way they wanted him to it would have been a moderate success at best
movies,not_removed,i thought the trailers were pretty good
movies,not_removed,that movie made me watch the originals i shoulda just watched
movies,not_removed,same and then it even went on to win many oscars
movies,not_removed,i have a hard time imagining a tarzan movie doing well in lol
movies,not_removed,was expecting it to be another john carter or the lone gunmanranger
movies,not_removed,after the martian and interstellar i fully expect matt damon to headline the lost in space reboot
movies,not_removed,as soon as the trailer came out everyone knew it was gona b goood
movies,not_removed,and having one save a life which was super smart of him boards became insanely popular soon after
movies,not_removed,they didnt understand the point of making a movie with a known conclusion really thats a silly criticism romeo and juliet straight up tell you at the start theyre going to die its all about the story that leads to the climax though maybe i was too young to remember was titanic sold as more of a historical piece rather than the story of the people on the ship
movies,not_removed,masterful naming got it noticed had they called it bite breeze or great white wind itd have probably sunk without trace
movies,not_removed,goes to show how much drawing power eddie murphy had at the time
movies,not_removed,the animated one sure did take off have you seen the live action frozen its more of a thrillersuspense movie and i thought it was pretty decent
movies,not_removed,i knew frozen would be a hit when i saw it was a disney musical with two princesses i was like oh god they figured it out im honestly a little surprised were not seeing some kind of disney cinematic universe where eventually well have ariel belle jasmine etc team up a la the avengers good god the money factory it would be i think its something disneys holding in their pocket if they ever need to make a serious recovery the same way nintendo is holding the idea of a fully fleshedout pokemon mmo
movies,not_removed,im not surprised by that one maybe i just have all likeminded company around me but i havent heard or read a single person say anything negative about that movie outside of reddit and rotten tomatoes
movies,not_removed,i went to see this in cinema it fucking sucked all i remember is the sex scene
movies,not_removed,did that do well it seemed to me that i heard it was being made and then the next time i heard anything about it was seeing the blu ray in stores
movies,not_removed,thats a good example even looking at the movie case it doesnt look like something id enjoy
movies,not_removed,mib was also way better than it had any right to be i thought mib wasnt that great and its pretty rare for a franchise to recover after a weak sequel
movies,not_removed,everyone was skeptical of ledger until the first trailers hit i was one of the skeptics myself and i remember thinking well okay thats really not what i was expecting iron man was definitely lucky rdj was great casting they also had to make it during the writers strike but they managed something decent i imagine if i were to rewatch it today it wouldnt seem that great but standards for superhero movies were pretty low at the time as you say
movies,not_removed,bigbudget superhero movies have reached something like the status of american families that go to church on holidays you dont really understand the appeal but you just feel like you have to do it out of cultural obligation
movies,not_removed,true when i saw batman wearing a jacket i thought it was the nail in the coffin for that movie
movies,not_removed,a good example of a movie being all hype
movies,not_removed,woof that movie was hot garbage but dinosaurs money
movies,not_removed,that joker costume it could be the worse character design ive ever seen in a movie
movies,not_removed,im right there with you i thought the trailers looked horrible
movies,not_removed,there was a hot tub time machine
movies,not_removed,hell yeah such a dumb concept
movies,not_removed,world wide and domestic in
movies,not_removed,same here for guardians of the galaxy when i heard that michael rooker batista and vin diesel were the only big names i was sure itd end up on syfy or something but it turned out to be an alright movie
movies,not_removed,when will someone else get a chance
movies,not_removed,i agree with this one i believe it came out in and had no desire to watch it but then i came across it on netflix about a month ago figured id give it a go and thoroughly enjoyed it
movies,not_removed,most of the movies animated though
movies,not_removed,if it makes you feel better you werent far off wolverine origins made million dollars xmen first class made million dollars and cost more to make throw in its marketing and first class barely broke even
movies,not_removed,i thought that one did bomb lol
movies,not_removed,for me its only when something is the bomb
movies,not_removed,a bomb as in the blew up the box office
movies,not_removed,begins made more money than any other batman film apart from the film nothing about begins box office was mediocre
movies,not_removed,same here the first two batman begins and the dark knight are two of my favorite superhero movies but i didnt think they would be at first
movies,not_removed,same here the first two batman begins and the dark knight are two of my favorite superhero movies but i didnt think they would be at first
movies,not_removed,batman begins made more than double its budget how the fuck is that not a success
movies,not_removed,for the record i enjoyed toy story i thought it would be just an easy cash grab but it was really intense
movies,not_removed,it isnt the volume of histroy it develops its the way it develops them
movies,not_removed,its literally not any of those things its the very well choreographed fight scenes
movies,not_removed,the trailer is actually what threw me off it wasnt the trailer that actually had anything about the plot it was just keanu reeves killing people and that line about people keep asking me if im back yeah im thinking im back just sounded so stupid in the trailer it made more sense in context though
movies,not_removed,was not mindless though it was so well crafted and intelligently funny with actual great comedic directing it isnt on par with edgar wrights directing but its pretty close
movies,not_removed,those films arent even close to mindless though theyre very well written satires
movies,not_removed,and he or at least his movies keep getting better compare the in kick ass to the in kingsman
movies,not_removed,to me the marketing for kingsman made it look like yet another ya book adaptation along the lines of divergent or some other crappy hunger games wannabe and i had basically no interest in seeing it i was pleasantly surprised when i saw in in the theaters and ended up getting a roger moore bond movie with more selfawareness and violence but rewatching it im not sure if it really holds up all that much its not a bad actioncomedy in retrospect just kind of an alright one compared to something like jump street
movies,not_removed,td was the best ff movie in my eyes the protagonist was pretty lame but the street racing aspect and fish out of water cliche were done really well the other movies are pretty good but thats the one that stuck with me
movies,not_removed,han is my favorite character from the franchise cool as a cucumber
movies,not_removed,i liked most of the ff series i always fall asleep on but it was tokyo drift i ended up seeing first in theaters i say probably the final race and han were the only big reasons i like and rewatch it
movies,not_removed,td was the best ff movie in my eyes the protagonist was pretty lame but the street racing aspect and fish out of water cliche were done really well the other movies are pretty good but thats the one that stuck with me
movies,not_removed,also he s shot down the drone with an ambulance he stole
movies,not_removed,i always wondered how he was able to use that since there was no trigger
movies,not_removed,daddys gotta go to work
movies,not_removed,daddys gotta go to work
movies,not_removed,they feel like what the gi joe movies should have been like bunch of cool cars and vehicles with guns that pop out of them shooting at each other for two hours
movies,not_removed,is pretty cool for the japanese culture aspect is utterly forgettable is a damn awesome heist is getting a little weird is a bad cash grab that only did well because the star died before release
movies,not_removed,the opening scene of horrible bosses is better than the entirety of
movies,not_removed,thats not saying much
movies,not_removed,i actually really like the car system in that movie aside from the car being sentient and having feelings the idea that know one owns a car and one just drives itself to your door when you need it would be great in the future
movies,not_removed,really only reason to see it imo was talking to someone recently that never watched it and they asked if they should see it i think the only reason i enjoyed the film was the theatre experience so thats what i told them
movies,not_removed,i remember the first time watching it just amazed at the way it showed depth and so far was the only movie that was worth the price of admission
movies,not_removed,you are like a baby not know what to do
movies,not_removed,most rmovies comment ive seen in a while
movies,not_removed,the bad guy had a few good lines
movies,not_removed,youre not in kansas anymore youre on pandora
movies,not_removed,lol since when is not a memorable line a form of film critique most films dont have memorable lines and if thats a way you judge a movies quality then i dont know what to say what was a memorable line in mad max the revenant ex machina outside of star wars and terminator i cant think of many films that have any dialogue thats repeated in pop culture
movies,not_removed,maybe for you but my family and friends quote it all the time
movies,not_removed,jesus christ reddit no it wouldnt fucking let the last airbender circlejerk die already
movies,not_removed,february release date is usually a doa time slot
movies,not_removed,pena was really important to that movie he didnt have a massive role but having someone who brought something that felt fresh and new because douglas and kate from lost definitelywerent interested in doing that to bounce off rudd gave the movie an extra something
movies,not_removed,they gave a nod to that sketch in the movie httpwwwslashfilmcomantmansnleasteregg
movies,not_removed,iron man
movies,not_removed,i think the incredible hulk and iron man are pretty bad
movies,not_removed,i dont understand the succes of the film personally i found the movie to be a fun watch its a comedyheist film with superheroes tacked on and with the comedy part being actually funny so that even if the heistsuperhero part felt a lil flat the film would at least be enjoyable rudd and pena were great in ant man as well which helped the movie a lot pena especially had a few memorable scenes and i hope he features more in the mcu
movies,not_removed,i dislike most super hero films but liked most of ant man it felt like it was about something paul rudds character while childish wasnt a teenage power fantasy like almost all of the rest and it felt like there were reasons for him to do what he does and to put on a suit other than being badass and saving the world and catapulting the film from one meaningless action scene to the next it embraced the inherent silliness and idiocy of the genre in a downtoearth way that was extremely refreshing
movies,not_removed,omg you disliked a marvel movie heathen downvotes to you rmovies
movies,not_removed,personally i really enjoyed rudd thought the movie didnt take itself to seriously its ant man how can it and had some really well done action sequences the humor was pretty great as well it had probably the worst antagonist ive seen in a marvel film but otherwise it was enjoyable
movies,not_removed,i sort of felt the same i was excited about edgar wright being involved and then he was let go but i kept up the excitement and expectation of a wright inspired result naturally i felt let down when that wasnt the case paul rudd is a comedic treasure though and somehow doesnt age so he carried the film well enough for me
movies,not_removed,i read the book before didnt like it at all felt like a cheap copy of the much better war day but with zombies instead of nukes
movies,not_removed,i saw it after the reading the book and i loved it it had nothing to do with the book but that is fine with me
movies,not_removed,i read the books thoroughly enjoyed them and also really enjoyed the movie i think i just didnt go into the film with any huge expectations that it would match the book and went in expecting a big budget zombie movie helmed by a successful actorproducer i liked so what i got was a well acted big budget zombie movie with a good plot and some really tense scenes
movies,not_removed,i think the film is truer to the spirit of the book than people give it credit for yes it abandons the structure but a big part of the book was getting to see how different parts of the world had been afflicted by the zombie outbreak and through brad pitts character we get glimpses of that its still a very poor adaptation as the books screams to be turned into a miniseries but its a halfdecent zombie action movie in its own right
movies,not_removed,but it was a relatable weird and chris pratt is amazing
movies,not_removed,hell one of the trailers just lists all of the oscar nominees and winners in the cast its funny because i thought guardians of the galaxy would be really successful but i also thought it would be really good it ended up successful but i ended up not really liking it that much
movies,not_removed,hulk was one of marvels most ubiquitous characters before the mcu took off for most people marvel was spidey hulk and wolverine plus the xmen cap was kind of known because how can you forget that name thors an odd one due to norse mythology but iron man was definitely a b player though
movies,not_removed,between lou ferrignos tv show and the movie i wouldnt say hulk was unknown for non comic readers im not one and the hulk smash catchphrase was pretty well known for everybody before the mcu agree on the rest had no idea who iron man or thor were well i knew thor the god not the superhero and captain america seemed to be uninteresting as hell glad to be wrong there
movies,not_removed,i never understand people who try to claim iron man captain america thor or hulk were at any time obscure comic book heroes iron man for instance had its own cartoon as far back as the i recall schoolyard arguments over whether the black sabbath song was inspired by the comic book hero or not and i never read a comic as a kid i recall the hulk tv show being a huge deal growing up snl has been doing superhero sketches since the and hulk has always been the funniest part of them captain america and thor were simply always around without question someone in my neighbourhood was always captain america on halloween years ago what some people dont realize is that comics used to be cheap grocery store check out purchases they were all over that shit and in your face way back not comic book stores i didnt even know comic book stores existed until i was an adult as much as people knew the the latest headlines in the national enquirer and other grocery store check out mags people always saw the covers of captain america thor hulk iron man and the like i say all this as a noncomic book reader or buyer the general audience knew more than superman spiderman and batman though they were admittedly the top tier yeah i didnt know about punisher the crow judge dredd blade and even xmen until much later in life and only about when the movies came out and i think the general audience is probably with me on that i had heard of xmen before it came out but only as a general concept as in i knew wolverine was an xmen but thats about it people have underestimated many super heroes and their general fame comic book geeks think of someone like spawn as famous when spawn doesnt hold a candle to how well known heroes like antman and dr strange really are
movies,not_removed,i dont think they were unknown as much as they were tier in terms of fame because they were nowhere near as obscure as guardians of the galaxy or black panther
movies,not_removed,growing up i would consider super heroes to be superman spiderman batman hulk captain america and wonder woman maybe even fantastic four because they were always in the shitty comics the dentist gave out it wasnt until the movies that i became aware of xmen iron man or thor let alone daredevil or antman or any of the named villains in any of those movies
movies,not_removed,bear in mind that at that point marvel studios had a track record of taking non alist actors and having them do really well with the roles also i wouldnt call chris pratt bautista bradley copper and zoe saldena nobodies they were all already costars in other successful franchises
movies,not_removed,dont you mean green lantered it
movies,not_removed,its a surprise that reynolds got famous at all hes just so bad at picking projects not complaining about deadpool though he hit gold with that one
movies,not_removed,sure it was rrated but the script was almost wholesome in a way it felt like a fourquadrant movie despite all of the sex and violence or at least more sweet and less morose than something like bvs
movies,not_removed,easy to say with hindsight but most studios would baulk at an r rated superhero movie
movies,not_removed,what do you consider a massive following any time you release an rrated movie youre going to be selling to a smaller crowd than if you market it to a generalfamily audience thats one of the reasons disney is one of the biggest movie companies around another factor to consider is the fact that fox hasnt had a great track record with superhero flicks they released xmen and xmen origins wolverine
movies,not_removed,i think it studios also consider peripheral sales im sure theres a real word for it but idk like toys dvds apparel etc its gotta be tough as a studio exec to immediately cut out of your postmovie consumers its probably for this same reason that a lot of regular superhero movies pack a lot of unnecessary villains and side characters im looking at you dcu
movies,not_removed,maybe a massive following on reddit but ask someone a year ago who deadpool was and i doubt many would know hell i knew countless people who had seen xmen origins but still had no idea ryan reynolds was some comic book character named deadpool
movies,not_removed,but you couldnt tell that from the trailers for all we knew it could have been another corky romano
movies,not_removed,hasnt aged terribly well at all
movies,not_removed,exactly any other actor in that role and it may not have been a hit at that time jim carry could do no wrong
movies,not_removed,not really that complicated for example i knew i probably wouldnt like x men apocalypse but i knew it would make a lot of money
movies,not_removed,you were still correct technically avatar
movies,not_removed,but its not avatar and titanic still beat it
movies,not_removed,ironic because all these comments are carbon copies too
movies,not_removed,its true though there is almost no originality in tfa i watch star wars because i like the universe and seeing all of the wonderful locations and characters in it tfa felt like it was afraid to go any further than the ot this not only made it uninteresting but it went against the lore of the world established at the ending of rotj now they have to awkwardly describe why the empire still exists and the ending of rotj is invalid i did like that kylo ren is not a carbon copy of vader at least hopefully the next movies will explore new things
movies,not_removed,definitely worth a go if you like lighthearted capers
movies,not_removed,its got a different tone from the last good one but it does so much right quality comedic performers from top to bottom not a remake and some nice pacing it definitely hit the fun throwaway adventure that isnt exhausting or overstuffed blockbuster note that ive been craving more and more
movies,not_removed,i expected independence day resurgence money at best which is of what it made i finally saw it it seemed about as bad as i expected reinterpreting the elegant goldblum philosophy of the first movie was as painfully nonsensical as it sounded for a nowsuccessful theme park embodied in chris pratts earnest insistence that these dinosaurs are literally dinosaurs ii know man
movies,not_removed,if by decent money you mean the httpwwwboxofficemojocomalltimeworld then yeah i guess thats pretty decent definitely a pile of turds though
movies,not_removed,i still watch the trailers from time to time i found them so good i havent been that hyped for a movie in god knows how long
movies,not_removed,yeah definitely the trailers were what sold me that this movie could be good there was that one with classical music too that was fantastic
movies,not_removed,booooo the original is my favourite
movies,not_removed,yeah the original is fine but the road warrior negates any reason to watch it when they sum up everything worthwhile in the minutes before the film
movies,not_removed,it made more than double its budget it did fine
movies,not_removed,the lone ranger
movies,not_removed,the trailer was awesome set a really entertaining tone that was extremely fresh it was obvious everyone loved the trailer in the cinema i was in there were immediate whispers along the line of we got to see that from everyone fortunately the film lived up to the trailer
movies,not_removed,i laughed out loud at your reply well played sir
movies,not_removed,im taking about when they were filming tons of jokes were made about how it was a waste of money once it was produced and marketed as a love story people were all over it dont tell me how it end almost million dollars was a decent amount of money to invest in a movie
movies,not_removed,bite breeze is the asylum knockoff of sharknado wait
movies,not_removed,the sex scene the only reason i recommended it to a friend eva green is fucking hot
movies,not_removed,yeah looks like it did
movies,not_removed,mib was so bad that i didnt even see mib sounds like i should
movies,not_removed,there was not but they wanted to name it hot tub time machine to change confuse people in thinking the was then make it in retrospect
movies,not_removed,that doesnt exactly sound like highest grossing films of the year to me op confused
movies,not_removed,how did that bomb
movies,not_removed,that especially hahaha
movies,not_removed,now im not sure what do you meani dont think of a literally bombing but as being a great movie lol
movies,not_removed,im not trying to slam the movie but i doubt that the box office could be considered more than mediocre adjusted for inflation the only batman that made less prior was batman robin batman returns made about the same as begins when you adjust for inflation which was bad enough for them to change the director from tim burton to joel schumacher adjusted for inflation begins had also the highest budget bar batman robin till then no batman begins was no home run looking at the box office the dark knight became the first true success
movies,not_removed,i thought doubling its budget is just barely breaking even maybe i missunderstood rmovies
movies,not_removed,yes it doesnt go about spelling every little detail out for you
movies,not_removed,great send up of sequels these shoes and you cant even see them
movies,not_removed,the church fight made me love colin firth that and the goddamn free bird song
movies,not_removed,vaughn films these scenes with such an inherent frenetic energy i think he employs a similar technique to what george miller did with fury road—cut out a few frames here and there its more obvious in the warehouse fight from kick ass than in the church fight but its something i hope doesnt become overused because i love it
movies,not_removed,if youre going to compare the movies at least use the better scene
movies,not_removed,this is probably an unpopular opinion but i disliked kingsman in general and the fight scenes such as the one the church i disliked even more i was really surprised how well the movie was received
movies,not_removed,to me the marketing for kingsman made it look like yet another ya book adaptation along the lines of divergent or some other crappy hunger games wannabe and i had basically no interest in seeing it thats exactly how i saw it too i was delightfully proven wrong
movies,not_removed,were always the best because they were actually about street racing the new ones are just plain action films with some cars in
movies,not_removed,for me its td then mayyybe they start to blur together tbh but and are well down the list im a closet car nut and i loved td because it had enough winks and nods to the community without being insulting or detracting from a reasonably solid story
movies,not_removed,in your defence tokyo drift is the only one thats about racing
movies,not_removed,i liked it because it wasnt point break on wheels until they dropped the undercover cop plot they were easier to watch
movies,not_removed,nooo fast five for sure it was like a point breakff mashup that worked because of how likable all the characters ended up being the chemistry of the actors shown through
movies,not_removed,eh the way they did the whole drifting cars being able to do everything and not slide when running normally thing was pretty stupid
movies,not_removed,tokyo drift is my favorite of the series aside from being the temporal junction point of the entire fast and furious universe its the only one where nobody is doing anything positive theres no crime lord to bust no theft ring to break up no personal revenge none of that shit just a guy who shows up in japan says excuse me could someone direct me to the illegal racing scene and takes it over one asshole versus another asshole all the men are assholes and all the women are whores it is a movie that knows what it is so fully that you cant help but cheer at how well executed the whole thing is
movies,not_removed,then you need to watch better luck tomorrow
movies,not_removed,you clearly havent played halo
movies,not_removed,raw strength
movies,not_removed,was ridiculous and awesome they parachute cars out of a cargo plane into a mountain road chase the rock flexes his cast off then drives an ambulance off a bridge into a drone then rips the drones minigun off and uses it to shoot down a helicopter all while delivering ridiculous one liners vin diesel drives a car out one skyscraper into another then out that skyscraper and into another those movies arent going for realism theyre going for ridiculous and entertaining especially since and they very much succeed
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,sadly i never got to see it in theaters in but i still enjoyed it nonetheless
movies,not_removed,skxawng
movies,not_removed,imho moon is the greatest film since tdk
movies,not_removed,nonsense most rmovies comments shit on the film
movies,not_removed,c u l t u r a l i m p a c t u l t u r a l i m p a c t
movies,not_removed,go get ya shine box
movies,not_removed,i mean you are getting downvoted but a lot of people do agree with that the story was told fantastically through the show imo there does not need to be a live action film of it
movies,not_removed,our jerking goes far beyond reddit
movies,not_removed,a kids film when no other kids films are coming out based on a pre established name will make money
movies,not_removed,less is more fast times at ridgemont high spicoli isnt in a lot of the scenes but the ones hes in are great
movies,not_removed,i loved it after watching end of watch yesterday i have really grown fond of pena as an actor
movies,not_removed,his role certainly felt big
movies,not_removed,wow thanks for this i never saw the movie now i wish i had it would have been a nice surprise
movies,not_removed,not good but not bad
movies,not_removed,its a superhero movie where a major city isnt destroyed or under threat
movies,not_removed,to add to what you said the shrinking powers also allowed them to some really cool new and refreshing action scenes in the suitcase the toy train that helped make those stand out from the typical superhero brawl
movies,not_removed,pretty much ant man was a very mediocre film im being generous thats it
movies,not_removed,max brooks wasnt too happy with the way the film went is my understanding nothing like the book which i liked very much
movies,not_removed,i agree with you for the most part but i would tweak it that it should be turned into a docudrama like something you would have seen on the history channel before they went full time reality shows i think it was actually a pretty good adaptation in the sense of taking the source material and somehow crafting a narrative out of it but sadly doing that reduces the story to a manageable number of people with a hero so it had to invent a magic bullet to finish the heros arc the book was the triumph of human will ingenuity and willingness to set aside differences in the face of extinction on the scale of the entire surviving population which strikes me as being mostly impossible to portray in a movie
movies,not_removed,i totally agree the book is a guy traveling the world interviewing people on their zombie experience the movie is a guy traveling the world interviewing people on their zombie experience as it is happening
movies,not_removed,i enjoyed the movie and youre right its fun but the spirit of the book was more how did different people and places deal with the outbreak rather than just showing the outbreak in different places each section of the book highlighted a totally different approach to survival where the movie only show brad pitt finding a singular way as everyone around him resorts to the same tactics and attempts at survival
movies,not_removed,i kinda thought id like it a little more too at least when i first saw it i gotta say though ive seen it other times since then and the viewing was my favorite i think it actually grew on me rewatching it
movies,not_removed,because a noncomic collectors main exposure to comic characters are through other media especially for people that are in their and right now who would ostensibly be the target audience for a lot of those movies look at the media we were exposed to prior to the xmen movies kicking off successful superhero franchises in the we had the awesome xmen batman and spiderman cartoon series that we would watch every saturday morning batman and superman movies have been made in the late through to the these are the heroes that people readily identify with because we grew up exposed to them snl featuring the hulk isnt because he was popular its because there was a show about him that they wanted to make fun of theres a reason why marvel sold off the movie rights to the xmen and spiderman franchises but kept the avengers no one that wasnt a comic collector gave a shit about the avengers until the movies started coming out at best they were aware of them because youd see some comics in a grocery store magazine shelf
movies,not_removed,people knew hulk and cap but when you got to iron man and thor people really didnt know on top of that thor is a pretty weird property almost as weird as guardians of the galaxy what it did right was focusing on the family drama that makes the comic so much fun so long as they dont touch that one loki storyim not ready for that
movies,not_removed,guardians of the galaxy had more academy award nominees and winners than any other marvel movie it also had the highest production budget of any marvel movie up to then marvel wasnt taking any chances with this property they put a shitton of talent and money into making the infinity stones work and introducing thanos
movies,not_removed,he seemingly had to fight tooth and claw to get his deadpool movie not sure how true it was but he really liked the character and was totally upset with how he was treated in the xmen wolverine movie
movies,not_removed,so many people say that but why would they an r rated comedy action blockbuster thats like saying they would baulk at a seth macfarlane comedy which even then would still be a bigger risk than deadpool was
movies,not_removed,true but you said it yourself compared to other comic movies it still had a budget of million and thats without even factoring in the marketing budget which for this film must have been huge it was also just below the original x men film budget by about million which was a bigger risk i would say
movies,not_removed,your first argument makes no sense you know that fox universal and paramount pictures are all also some of the biggest companies around and bring out rrated comedies constantly deadpan has a massive following not to mention one of the most annoying people who dont know anything about comics still think hes the best character because he makes jokes true but they have also seen a massive amount of success with their more recent xmen films sure apocalypse wasnt good but both first class and dofp rejuvenated the franchise and made it ridiculously profitable again
movies,not_removed,the thing is though there was still massive amounts of merchandise moved by deadpool not to mention although its r rated most kids still know who he is the sense of humour alone appeals to mostly years old teenagers
movies,not_removed,bullshit deadpool has been one of the most over exposed comic book characters in the past few years he is massive all over the internet he regularly has a series and is a ridiculously recognisable character deadpan was huge before this film sure some people you might know didnt know who he was but the fact he was in that film was a massive talking point
movies,not_removed,what timeline are you on
movies,not_removed,not true watched it with other people on vacation recently and we were all laughing our asses off
movies,not_removed,it didnt make as much it broke even
movies,not_removed,i will admit the act is the same but i saw it more as we are doomed to repeat are past i honesty loved the shit out of both finn and rey not to mention all i can say is the movie i watched was a star wars movie and after movies that left me empty it was nice to get that blockbuster magic back
movies,not_removed,rotjs ending is so perfect rotj might be the weakest of the ot but it takes a giant dump on tfa
movies,not_removed,yeah its not a good movie or anything but itspleasing easy to watch pretty dumb but doesnt make your brain hurt as much as it pains me to say it i think it might be better than lost world which is waaay better directed and the worst action scene in lw is better than the best in jw but is also stuck with the least likable characters and way too much selfimportance and jurassic park iii
movies,not_removed,disagree on all points just about nothing made me laugh the characters lack any character whatsoever throwaway is an apt description as nothing felt like it mattered or had any heft to it
movies,not_removed,but hes only mad max for maybe the last minutes the rest of the time he is indecisive max who wears terry cloth shorts
movies,not_removed,i liked it but the pacing is so bizarre i wouldnt recommend it to most people
movies,not_removed,it just didnt make sense to me i watched it on netflix and there was setup in it the whole time i was like wtf why not just call the cops national guard sorry the third one was a fucking weird kids movie edit striked out part
movies,not_removed,especially considering it did not play in china
movies,not_removed,doubled its production budget that doesnt factor in the marketing budget and the fact that in the end the studio only gets roughly of the final worldwide box office takings it more than likely lost money probably needed something like million to break even
movies,not_removed,yeah thankfully that was the case the places and character designs were top notch
movies,not_removed,huh guess im just out of the loop
movies,not_removed,begins doubled its budget it was a massive success financially you also have to remember it making the same as returns is amazing considering returns was the sequel to one of the biggest comic book movies ever which was also a massive success when it first came out this was a batman film with no prior film connections
movies,not_removed,sure the scene is better but the other scene compares much better to kingsman in style this is more of a matrix hommage no pretend tracking shot of one guy clearing a room with his gun and some gadgets
movies,not_removed,why
movies,not_removed,they films are selfaware that they are cliches and make fun of themselves at every opportunity its weird i love them because they know exactly what they are and own it
movies,not_removed,is low on the list for me too other than the great opening chase its hard to blame the movie though it really does just exist to do a whole shitload of work to reassemble the character diaspora of the previous three films it had to happen for so it was worth it
movies,not_removed,mine goes
movies,not_removed,havent played it in years
movies,not_removed,i think it takes a little more than raw strength to fire a gattling gun with no trigger lol
movies,not_removed,maybe i dont live in the burbs so i havent encountered many airbender fans in fact i only know of one and he liked the movie that came out a few years back
movies,not_removed,spicoli what are you doing eatin pizza learnin history
movies,not_removed,the smaller scale of the villain and his plan pun intended was pretty refreshing after the last few mcu movies
movies,not_removed,much more relatable for me
movies,not_removed,i think disneymarvel has their formula almost perfected in all their movies you get some laughs at the teather you get some action then a touching bonding moment and overall is a pretty feelgood feeling after it ends since you dont really get any bad feels about it the word of mouth spreads and the critics give good ratings and the money machine speaks for itself but are they really good rewatchable movies that stand on their own i think some do but some dont but they are a juggernaut right now and any bad opinion is gonna get buried
movies,not_removed,im not a huge fan of zombie stuff but i loved the book because it was such a unique way to tell a story then they took that property and made a generic zombie movie it actually made me bitter that the movie didnt bomb
movies,not_removed,thats very true it is more about the different perspectives of the human will than it was about seeing different locations with the exception of the stealthly section in the cdc youre right it was disappointing that everyones strategy was basically just send in the military and hope for the best
movies,not_removed,i think it just depends on the generation i think the were really big for spiderman xmen batman because each of those had really good and popular tv series superman is ubiquitous
movies,not_removed,iron man was literally everywhere in the not just two television shows but guest spots in every other marvel show except fantastic four marvel had plans for him and they got started feathering that bed fucking early to the point that tom cruise was in talks to play him
movies,not_removed,how many other r rated action comedies in the mould of deadpool can you name though
movies,not_removed,i dont disagree with you i just think from a older established exec point of view thats never really seen r rated generate much merchandising its a tough sell
movies,not_removed,on the internet surebut most people going to see movies arent going on redditmovies and other forums on a daily basis id imagine the number of people over the age of who were aware of deadpool before the film buzz started gaining traction was very low he is not on the level of batmanspidermansupermanxmenavengersfantastic for the average moviegoer
movies,not_removed,dude im at work i dont have time to google shitty comedy movies that were made before
movies,not_removed,apocalypse cost million and made million
movies,not_removed,i love tfa but im also a pretty big star wars fan im not sure what it would be like for someone who wasnt familiar with the series it really did feel more like a star wars bestof special where they kind of threw in everything star warsy and tried to get us amped up again more wonderful world of disney type event to start off the real movies
movies,not_removed,i preferred that he was an actual character with feelings rather than a mute badass
movies,not_removed,its definitely dated quite badly but i still love it
movies,not_removed,pretty sure max is the cop they even go back to the police precinct a few times in the first film remember its a dystopian film so the police arent exactly more powerful than the biker gangs
movies,not_removed,it did not need million to break even it made them money hence why a sequel is already under way the movie was only predicted to earn million not almost
movies,not_removed,cameron is my favourite director and writer horror or romance hes perfect
movies,not_removed,yepp i remember going to see it opening week and the theater was empty went back a week later to see it again and it was sold out i saw it in theaters times with my mom and various other people my mom had convinced to see it with us the only movie ive seen that many times in the theater since was the fellowship of the ring actually i got sick halfway through the time
movies,not_removed,no doubling its budget is just barely breaking even on returns i have to say that it had a better budget to boxoffice ratio but i will stop arguing now clearly im losing the popular vote
movies,not_removed,the fight scenes felt fake and just overall too silly as well the humor just wasnt my type of humor especially the princess parts
movies,not_removed,dang ive never seen a list so different from my own
movies,not_removed,i personally hated it went from silly fun to totally unbelievable and with literally consequences once dom survived rolling down a mountain immersion was totally broken
movies,not_removed,td last whys that too disconnected from the rest of the series just curious
movies,not_removed,me i didnt like the one at all cant really say why
movies,not_removed,nah
movies,not_removed,clearly not
movies,not_removed,must have never seen the series then
movies,not_removed,with the exception of iron man the avengers and gotg what you said applies to each of their films forgettable movies worth one watch i cant even remember the plots of most and the villains are like cheap parodies gotta give them credit though theyve got that feel good no consequence formula spot on people eat it up regardless i laugh when i see people branding films like winter soldier as political thriller its just way off ah well cant expect much from raging fanboys these days
movies,not_removed,i didnt mind the film thought it wasnt too bad not sure how theyd make a film based entirely by the book it jumps around so much theres no real flow
movies,not_removed,howard the duck
movies,not_removed,none because the investors are pansies
movies,not_removed,its like a more childish humour hot fuzz or a more action packed ted its like bad boys if they were wearing costumes
movies,not_removed,im not talking about reddit though im talking about facebook memes and youtube videos some of the most overexposed things out there deadpool had his own video game released hes not a small time character the way most people paint him he sells a ridiculous amount of books and merchandise im also willing to bet the number of people over the age of who go to see superhero films without being dragged by a child is also very low
movies,not_removed,but you have time to comment on reddit
movies,not_removed,add the marketing costs and that movies get half of the money from teathers
movies,not_removed,i feel like its not quite a dystopian film its on the brink of total dire anarchy but it doesnt quite get there until the road warrior
movies,not_removed,theyre really about the government not really being involved they obviously have no funding he has the last interceptor
movies,not_removed,sorry meant to say why not just call the army with that many issues
movies,not_removed,million domestic not worldwide the movie cost million to make throw the marketing budget into that and itll land somewhere in the million ballpark for the total budget thus the movie would have to make at least somewhere in the region of million just to cover total costs they probably made money in the long run off home sales but they will have certainly made a loss in the theaters a small loss but a loss all the same that said a sequel will still be in development because interest in the movie grew over time so financial projections for a sequel may be higher than the first one even though it wasnt a runaway success
movies,not_removed,the film doubled its budget and then made an additional million on top of that you are losing the popular vote because your argument is weak
movies,not_removed,while i can agree that yeah its no kick ass i believe sljs character actually says he doesnt watch spy movies because they take themselves too seriously that silliness is the crux of the entire film
movies,not_removed,youve never flexed off a cast
movies,not_removed,fighting a spaceship in los angeles was a little much for me too
movies,not_removed,i dont think lucas black is much of a lead actor i prefer his child roles much more than his adult acting i feel this way about most of the cast tbh the only exceptions are sung kang and sonny chiba the race scenes felt fractured and broken as fuck though i think you can tell by my ranking that i think lin gets way better the only two that work well are the opening in america and the climactic mountain drift where it finally realizes it can just smooth itself out for some very pleasurable drift shots the story isnt bad because its disconnected from the rest of the series its bad because it has literally no announced destination until the yakuza suddenly get involved and until then is just a great big meander in tokyo i should probably note that the only movies i like are fast and furious furious and fast five though i love all three so tokyo drift isnt alone in my dismay
movies,not_removed,all the racingdriving in it sucked
movies,not_removed,or heshe just doesnt like it you dont have to inherently love it if youve seen it
movies,not_removed,yeah i for one couldnt take seriously the threat of winter soldier yeah hydra infiltrated the government but they couldnt do shit years ago when they had an army with alien weaponry during and they were so incompetent back then and lo and behold they are incompetent now as well also thor ii was absolutely terrible the only good thing was anthony hopkins i could watch a movie about him as odin and how he spends his days casting judgment over the peoples but anyway thor had terrible chemistry on their leads and utterly useless and forgettable villain and there we have loki who actually seems that got more screentime than the villain the fight on asgard made no sense there is even a scene where the dark elves are fighting on a hall and they seem to be winning with ease next time we see the hall we see a bunch of dark elves corpses scattered on the floor and this movie got better critic ratings than man of steel
movies,not_removed,i may be beating a dead horse but it would have been an amazing miniseries on hbo or something whether they told each story like a traditional narrative or even did the whole thing like a documentary it would have kept the concept of the book which is the thing that made it unique
movies,not_removed,dont judge me
movies,not_removed,i read a timeline years ago that said mad max the apocalypse is about to happen mad max the apocalypse is happening mad max the apocalypse has happened
movies,not_removed,he stole the last interceptor after hed quit
movies,not_removed,ive broken a cast by falling down
movies,not_removed,i may be beating a dead horse you are
movies,not_removed,max mad financial apocalypse has happened mad max nuclear apocalypse has happened mad max fashion apocalypse has happened
movies,not_removed,mad max the apocalypse is cheesy
movies,not_removed,potato potato
movies,not_removed,holy cow id watch this
movies,not_removed,oh my god this is so dark id watch it based on that alone i only have one note the time machine should be a smart car and totally suck in any situation which doesnt involve time travel if the goal is to get to it should just fail roll credits
movies,not_removed,if they ever did another one of these movies id like to see one thing guy who will end up travelling through time is going about his business one thing or another leads himher to an abandoned location of some sort out of curiosity the character opens a door to a darkened room inside under a dusty tarp rests some sort of vehicle protagonist removes tarp and reveals the delorean back to the future time travel theme begins to play in the background
movies,not_removed,you forgot the inevitable scene where he raps in front of an audience and a person at the edge of the stage talks to someone on the phone michael michael its dennis your cousin dennis wright you know that new sound youre looking for well listen to this
movies,not_removed,i really enjoyed it a few years ago i went on a binge of watching the most offensive or unsettling movies i could find and that one was definitely up there due to the scene in the tunnel
movies,not_removed,honestly i watched it and it was too hard to focus on i could not appreciate the way it was shot or the point of the plot if there was one too all over the place for me sorry
movies,not_removed,anyone wanna talk about the film irreversible hell no i appreciate the technical merits of the movie and how it handled telling the story backwards was incredible unfortunately it is too disgusting of a movie to enjoy the experience
movies,not_removed,i highly recommend another of his films called enter the void you may feel compelled to turn it off after minutes but dont its a trip
movies,not_removed,all the floating around is really interesting i like to imagine its from the point of view of spoiler
movies,not_removed,if youre looking for disturbing films i recommend cannibal holocaust ive seen all the films mentioned here but seriously irreversible which i liked feels like disney compared to cannibal holocaust
movies,not_removed,great film very tough to watch but the way its shot edited acted is just brilliant i think its genuinely an amazing film
movies,not_removed,i just watched it myself you might be able to explain the last two scenes for me they seemed unnecessary and are the only whinge i have about the film after she goes to the bathroom i thought this is the perfect ending but there were a couple more scenes
movies,not_removed,no nobody wants to talk about this trauma this smashed in head raped in a tunnel sexually deviant ptsd inducing celluloid hatred
movies,not_removed,thats kind of what ive been doing watched martyrs the other day and this one so far has had the best actual merit as a film for a film thats notorious for being deeply disturbing
movies,not_removed,no need to apologize it definitely isnt for everyone at all and everyone is more than entitled to their opinion when it comes to movies i definitely understand it being too difficult to focus on from the camerawork
movies,not_removed,the way it was shot was part of the point the beginning is completely chaotic because it reflected the main characters state of mind as the movie goes on the shooting style becomes more clear and colourful as the story edges toward the happy ending
movies,not_removed,i watched enter the void twice first time i didnt really like it at all and was disappointed because the subject matter particularly interested me then second viewing i realized that the reason i didnt like it was that i found the acting to be particularly subpar making me feel extremely aware that i was watching a movie the entire time i didnt feel that these characters ever really existed so it didnt make it particularly intriguing or devastating to follow their suffering that being said the filming was great and story was interesting just wished it had better actors to carry it more
movies,not_removed,i actually disagree on this ive seen his other films and this was by far my favorite lol
movies,not_removed,wow definitely an interesting theory wouldnt put it past noe if this is the case especially with his approach in enter the void
movies,not_removed,nah cannibal holocaust was nothing compared to martyrs for me
movies,not_removed,i agree and honestly i expected from all the warnings people gave me prior to viewing it that it would be much more difficult to watch but i found it wasnt that bad maybe im desensitized but even so i do find some films difficult to watch but irreversible was excellent and compelling and so well done that it was relatively easy to get past the disturbing scenes simply because of how well they were done
movies,not_removed,the ending man it was perfect you see her peacefully in the grass surrounded by children beethoven playing in the background everything is bright and relaxing it feels good and bitter at the same time you see the green of the grass in opposition to the red that reminds you of the darkest moments of the film children are running around her they normaly represent happiness but here they echo her loss spoiler the camera ends on the spining thing wich is again a reminder of the beggining where the camera was totally erratic the music captures this moment even better with the only piece of classical music so far it makes the scene heavier than a normal scene of a girl in a park it forces you to look for the details i just listed this ending captures everything that will come and gives you an overlook in a superb manner using the colors the music and the childs because of that you cant stand up immidiately after the film ended you have to stay seated and meditate on what you saw and then you can go look for a hug
movies,not_removed,fair enough i respect your opinion
movies,not_removed,have you seen his first i stand alone you should
movies,not_removed,martyrs is still my favorite as far as hopeless violent movies go i think its even more fucked than serbian film that movie definitely had more fucked up individual scenes but it was almost goofy at certain points whereas martyrs was non stop hopelessness
movies,not_removed,but all the animal violence in cannibal was real did you know that those werent special effects they just didnt give a shit martyrs is a far better movie but i know its all fake so i wasnt bothered too much
movies,not_removed,you have to stay seated and meditate on what you saw my friend and i did that after watching prisoners we just sat in the cinema watching people leaving it took the whole credits before we could stand up and leave
movies,not_removed,fair enough to each their owni stand alone was on a subject matter that makes me uncomfortable so i didnt enjoy it whatsoeverenter the void i thought sounded great on paper but in the end couldve been done better in my opinioni watched it twice and both times the biggest drawback for me was that the actors were very mediocre aside from the actor who played alexin irreversible however it felt so genuineespecially belluci and cassels chemistry considering they were really married in real life and pierre was excellent as well i honestly think there are far more fucked up movies than irreversible and i was surprised at how much the rape scene defines the film in my opinion there is so much more to it than just being a movie with a fucked up scene i truly enjoyed it and would not hesitate to watch and analyze it again
movies,not_removed,yeah i knew that but it didnt phase me as much for some reason
movies,not_removed,they did however give all the meat from the slaughtered animals to the tribe so the meat didnt just go to waste
movies,not_removed,hmm martyrs wasdifferent now that i felt was the most disturbing film ive seen way more than salo which was the previous holder of the title still there was some beauty to it it did feel like a cliched psychological horror at points however i feel it brought an interesting perspective on how humans cope and handle pain or rather suffering it really did a good job at taking on that idea considering the subject material
movies,not_removed,ive heard a serbian film is the end all be all of disturbing filmshave heard of the poughkeepsie tapes but never realized it was that disturbing of a film might look into that as ive seen it mentioned a few times in other discussionsthink ive only vaguely heard august underground beforethank you for the recommendations though
movies,not_removed,i imagine it might be because this sub is tired of the endless discussions about that movie that tend to go nowhere
movies,not_removed,its a divisive movie man
movies,not_removed,it should have been included in the bluray
movies,not_removed,what did they add to the movie if u dont mind summarizing it
movies,not_removed,mostly because the people who have the strongest opinions about it are more likely to be people who enjoyed the movie in its theatrical version i read screenrants list of changes and it confirmed what i knew when i heard about the ultimate edition in the first place adding minutes of footage wasnt going to make this a good movie all of a sudden
movies,not_removed,they are jelly of all that sweet sweet disneymarvel money they arent getting
movies,not_removed,i already said this somewhere before yesterday the new copy will only change the minds of those who were on the border of thinking its badgood its that small push to good i personally enjoyed the film a lot and then got a overall better movie from the ultimate cut
movies,not_removed,because of shit posts like yours why is there so much desperation to defend this movie
movies,not_removed,those discussions usually end up discussing snyder himself rather than the flaws about movie and then people come out of the woodwork from all sides
movies,not_removed,um its a batman movie disney doesnt get shit from it
movies,not_removed,it moved me from travesty to still worse than any of marvels attempts but better than spiderman the thing that made me hate this movie the most is still in there which is a lex that is one of the worst portrayals to hit film hes not supposed to be a manic emo little kid a combination of riddler and joker hes a tycoon a manipulator never getting his own hands dirty and he certainly wouldnt have killed mercy
movies,not_removed,because people have the abilityfreedom to defend whatever they want online
movies,not_removed,with good reasons
movies,not_removed,you havent heard of the disney conspiracy about walt disney secretly being alive and controlling all aspects of hollywood from his lair on the death star s
movies,not_removed,with darth micky on his side
movies,not_removed,ok mods it is time to ban this silly clip it gets posted weekly wtf is it about this stupid clip that you people are so obsessed about
movies,not_removed,its the only gun i can hit a moving target with mind the grammar please its the only gun with which i can hit a moving target youd think a movie of this caliber could command a better script﻿
movies,not_removed,the cast was really where they screwed the pooch in my opinion the action was well done and more brutal then i was expecting for which actually fits the original games but that castjust fucking weak all around for a minute i thought it was going to be a coming of age story with baby face mcmage the guardian was tolerable the orcs actually were really well done the ridiculous costumes are very much in line with what i expected from playing the warcraft and wow over the top and sometimes looking like they are made of aluminum but really i thought they did a good job with the costumes the storywell they decided it was better to gloss over the expensive backstory to focus on a couple of characters development and im guessing that is for the sequels hopefully ifwhen they do pump out a sequel they can flesh out the universe i am a big fantasy nerd and even with its faults it was entertaining enough for a viewing looking forward to wasting a couple more hours of my life on the next one
movies,not_removed,sorry i lost you at terrible special effects
movies,not_removed,curse them for not casting everyone into the standard fantasy trope stereotype the acting was awkard at times but it still felt fine to me terrible special effectsreally
movies,not_removed,it was a good movie
movies,not_removed,you guys are crazy movie was awesome
movies,not_removed,they picked that part of warcraft lore which is confusing ideally youd want to introduce movie audiences to a less complicated time period fewer charactersnames to learn etc instead were dropped in a plot thats political this alone would not have been bad i normally like all the actors but here they looked comical in those oversized suits or armor plus the cgi didnt quite mesh with the real life actors dont get me wrong the cgi looked gorgeous but in comparisson the humans looked like they were from another movie
movies,not_removed,i agree and imo the ending sucked why is the shaman not killed after cheating to kill durotan the whole tribe chanted saying he cheated and it was dishonorable and not traditional but he livesbut they let anduin leave on his griffin after his victory because of honor and traditionsmh what kinda bullshit are they about tradition or not jeezsry for the rant
movies,not_removed,awful nah
movies,not_removed,i think it was that the movie was made by people who really like the games and lore thats why almost every scene is an exposition dump they wanted the audience to understand as much of the world as possible but ended up with a poor screenplay that tells instead of shows and weaknonexistent characterization not to mention the miscasting of most roles
movies,not_removed,its like a shittier lord of the cock rings
movies,not_removed,other than a couple of scenes with a mismatched special effects it was a great movie imo i went into it knowing it was going to be a fan service movie and that is exactly what we got
movies,not_removed,you just need to have played the games before it was a fanservice movie nothing more nothing less
movies,not_removed,to give just one example of the atrocious casting the king i mean are we seriously supposed to take that guy seriously or believe he holds any position of power they couldnt have cast a weaker actor with a less kingly look if they tried im assuming they didnt
movies,not_removed,wang jianlin is that you
movies,not_removed,so you played the games and dont enjoy good moviemaking solid
movies,not_removed,the plot was the big screw up for me there was no real sens of discovery and wonder the movie start with a baby going through a portal thats nice but then its only big battle and no real world building we dont see nothing or are taken on a magical journey
movies,not_removed,because he is powerful plus he still had blackhand at the end they didnt listen to gul dal because anduin had killed blackhand who had fel gul dal took garonas advice and let anduin go this is how there was no revolt at the end
movies,not_removed,did you miss the scene where orcs tried to rebel against him and guldan instantly sucked their souls out they didnt try to stop guldan because hes much stronger than any of them
movies,not_removed,definitely didnt strike me as the inspiring hero leading an army into the breach they just made everyone look to clean and prissy i appreciate that they didnt default to making everyone extra gritty and hard but they took it too far the other direction like with the new darth pussy in star wars
movies,not_removed,shhhh
movies,not_removed,precicely the warcraft series are interesting because you need to level your hero unit which to me was new back then wow is all about leveling and discovery those two aspects were sorely missing from the movie i would have welcomed a different approach with fewer characters my imagination went to something like first movie low level character leaves his village and goes on a heroes journey in which he discovers a bit of the world the other races learns questing picks up loot etc eg epic montage of kill somethings dropping weapons to pick up better ones etc second movie better loot we see character progression and maybe a wow instance done meaning we meet up with other specialised characters to take down a big boss and through it all we could have had a more epic backstory hinted meaning we do all these quests etc and in the end we learn that the fell is turning all these creatures we were questing and we need to stop the fell at its source etc theres so much potential but they had to go with the campy approach
movies,not_removed,i didnt miss that scene but were talking about the whole horde army seeing this and not doing anything about itthe whole plan was to rebel against guldan but then durotan got murdered dishonorably and no one cared at all even though it was against tradition but at the end homeboy flys away on the griffin and was let go because orc bitch was like oh guldan you gotta let him go cuz tradition derp derp and guldanwas finei can kill durotan untraditionally but this guy the one murkin orcs left band rightgets a tradition pass nopedidnt like the end man
movies,not_removed,i am not familiar with wow universe but i agree with your movie schems with the baby on the river i would have imagined a first movie about birth he is a mysterious child always by the river never leave its side in the second movie he is a young manwoman leaving the nature flow and going in battles in ht ethird movie at the very end a old man he became and came back to the river and make magic here but that would be just a little part and there would be another epic story next to it it would have been a mysterious metaphor its a shame i felt a lot of potential too of a world of wonder and it tasted more sour and dry than refreshind and magical
movies,not_removed,put yourself in the shoes of one of the orcs in the crowd you just saw guldan kill of your friends without even trying what else can he do can he killed all of you like that if you try to stop him will the others help you or are you just dooming yourself to die horribly do you really want to take that risk for the sake of tradition you have to remember that the orcs are just as human as well humans they have the same herd mentality and wont take action if no one else does
movies,not_removed,that is awesome
movies,not_removed,you are the chosen one
movies,not_removed,this is the first time ive heard about them remaking it stop just stoppppppp
movies,not_removed,i am ready for this pain this will bring
movies,not_removed,for me its the fact that he made up the whole story with objects around the room that and spaceys delivery was on point and the ending was so smooth
movies,not_removed,watch it a second time youll appreciate it more
movies,not_removed,ive heard that even the actor who played keaton thought his character was actually soze technically usual suspects has a double twist with it first being revealed by kujan that keaton is soze and then revealed by the objects in the office and the spaceys change of walk outside that he is soze
movies,not_removed,its not youre right its a bad twist it comes out of nowhere
movies,not_removed,because the audience in general wants to be fooled they feel it was worth their time if the director could fool them into believing that the past was all a buildup to this huge ass twist which tbh is pretty plain there have been some movies which have had far better twists but have been less appreciated
movies,not_removed,i always hated it i think its ridiculous that anyone especially the police would ever believe the story being spun by a character that everyone acknowledges is the brilliant plotmaster of a criminal team and for me knowing how directors tend to parse relevant plot details in mystery films i knew the second spoiler
movies,not_removed,all of the land before time sequels
movies,not_removed,the john leguizamo vehicle the pest its incredibly dumb incredibly dumb
movies,not_removed,fast furious ugh
movies,not_removed,kangaroo jack
movies,not_removed,im probably the only person on the planet that remembers it but in the there was a cheap et knock off called fuzzbucket predictably about a little boy who finds an alien the twist is this ones invisible i think i only vaguely remember the details it was my favorite movie when i was in england when i moved to the states no one had heard of it which was weird to me because the knew about everything else that was cool and even more stuff that i didnt know about before like ninja turtles so i put it out of my mind a years later last year to be exact i got curious and looked it up it took forever to find no one had ever heard of it i found it eventually and i started it in hopes that it would bring back good memories i only got minutes in it was simply atrocious no wonder nobody remembers that unholy abomination if a film just so bad in every conceivable way i still cant bring myself to watch the rest and its not even an hour long
movies,not_removed,flubber
movies,not_removed,spiderman
movies,not_removed,as a kid my friends and i loved the austin powers movies particularly the second one with fat bastard we would watch it pretty frequently and quote the movie regularly fast forward to present day i occasionally babysit a family with a girl who was around my age the movies came out she loves the movies and made us watch the second one i hadnt seen it since i was a teenager so i thought it might be nice to take a trip down memory lane it was terrible i didnt even crack a smile through the whole movie and the plot was god awful meanwhile my kid is rolling around laughing their ass off it just goes to show mike meyers was totally pandering to kids and god bless my mom for enduring all the times i insisted on renting it
movies,not_removed,fantastic four
movies,not_removed,monster squad loved it as a kid revisited it a few years ago and thought it was terrible great premise horrible execution
movies,not_removed,rockadoodle by don bluth i didnt realize how annoying it is they have someone narrating over everything opening musical number talked over by narrator he even restates what we just saw no way to be confused yet they have him spell everything out again
movies,not_removed,surf ninjas a redheaded rob schneider as the comic relief and a ninja who can see and control the future with his sega game gear as a kid i thought it was the coolest i mean just check out that totally rad httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvullwmfpeoui
movies,not_removed,my science project pretty much unwatchable i tried to rewatch it about years ago i remembered this scene where the main character outruns electricity running through power lines and thought it was awesome it is not
movies,not_removed,hey arnold the movie
movies,not_removed,the spongebob squarepants movie i found it entertaining when i watched it in theaters years later seeing it on tv it made me cringe and groan the whole time
movies,not_removed,this is a much more recent example but i watched unbreakable back when i was in college when it came out and i thought it was brilliant but man is it bad in retrospect
movies,not_removed,i always remembered heathers as awkwardly funny with great lasting quotes sat my teenagers down for some laughs and they watched on in horror and disgust
movies,not_removed,krull although i think it is still a decent movie for an bmovie but watching it now shows the lack in special effects and acting
movies,not_removed,i fucking loved the arnold schwarzenegger bmovie action flicks when i was a little kid especially commando and last action hero keep in mind im talking about the bmovies im not talking about predator or total recall i thought these two flicks were the quintessential action movies i realized the quality of the films were poor later in life but i may watch them every once in a while to see arnie kick ass and deliver some hilarious oneliners
movies,not_removed,et
movies,not_removed,mortal kombat i was about or when it came out i saw it again a few years ago at age and realized wow the graphics were really bad the storyline and actual action were decent
movies,not_removed,have you tried watching them in the chainsaw order
movies,not_removed,that was terrible even when i was younger a whole entire dance scene really
movies,not_removed,if you assume the black substance is an alien that tries to blend in but genuinely doesnt know how to act cool it almost becomes watchable
movies,not_removed,if you assume the black substance is an alien that tries to blend in but genuinely doesnt know how to act cool it almost becomes watchable
movies,not_removed,i still think the first is pretty funny every scene with seth green in it was really good
movies,not_removed,it is so over rated
movies,not_removed,im and i still like it
movies,not_removed,i really dont think its bad at all
movies,not_removed,i still love heathers why horror and disgust
movies,not_removed,i feel like a lot of those were kind of meant to be disposable movies in that you watch them enjoy them and then kinda forget about them they werent meant to stand the test of time
movies,not_removed,last action hero blows but commando is awesome
movies,not_removed,lol what
movies,not_removed,emo parker strutting down the street was the best part
movies,not_removed,back in the comedically using lbgt issues and school bombings was kinda funny actually it was funny as hell but my kids were like what the actual fuck are you having us watch have you never been crowded in a corner of a classroom for a three hour lockdown because some asshole called in a bomb threat we had to pee in juice bottles and jeremy couldnt get to his insulin so yeah heathers got tossed into the pile right next to some like it hot
movies,not_removed,yeah they are i agree keep in mind i was just a little kid watching these movies i had no idea what a true good film was
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,eh good is subjective once you get past technically a film
movies,not_removed,i i see
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,i love the fact that kurt russells son wyatt russell is in this movie he was an hockey player before he decided to be an actor its a great fit the first goon was great im looking forward to this with reasonable expectations
movies,not_removed,directed by jay baruchel awesome the cast in this movie is amazing
movies,not_removed,thanks for posting the trailer i cut big fan of this subreddit cant wait for yall to see the flick
movies,not_removed,gay porn hard
movies,not_removed,i loved the first one just light hearted comedy i kind of wish they went with his daughter he doesnt know existed shows up in his life she is around and just as rough and tough but i dont know i think it looks decent
movies,not_removed,guarantee the end will be him in massive pain with his shoulder but still fights through the pain to land the final punch
movies,not_removed,looks fun sean william scott is highly underrated
movies,not_removed,awesome number right there
movies,not_removed,two rules man stay away from my fuckin percocets and do you have any fucking percocets
movies,not_removed,i cant wait for this the first one was so good
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,is this the year of actors from black mirror popping up in surprisingly awesome movies hoping this will be on par with the first at least
movies,not_removed,anyone else feel that this trailer told us the whole movie
movies,not_removed,are they called highlanders cuz their jersey looks like the islanders but thats how a québécois would pronounce islanders
movies,not_removed,country mac is such a bad ass
movies,not_removed,i am a huge fan of how many pages this is taking out of the rocky playbook i am gay porn excited
movies,not_removed,wait is this the first trailer its coming out march and not in two weeks right
movies,not_removed,when everyone told me the first one was a great movie i thought nah this looks stupid now i think the same thing due to this trailer
movies,not_removed,remember that hockey movie starring seann william scott from a few years ago no well heres the sequel
movies,not_removed,no thank you
movies,not_removed,probably my favourite line
movies,not_removed,whats so fuckin funny giggly bits
movies,not_removed,doesnt play a goalie though i dont know why but in a hockey fight when the goalie joins in i smile
movies,not_removed,wow great info did not know he played hockey i remember him from black mirror
movies,not_removed,daaaamn thats who he is hes also in that horrifying black mirror episode good on him goon is going to be just as good
movies,not_removed,yeah and he only gets movie roles because his dads kurt russel for fucks sake the guy is just meh hes meh in everything doesnt bring anything new to the table hollywood is such a friends business most of the time
movies,not_removed,i think he directed the first one as well
movies,not_removed,goon daddy issues
movies,not_removed,with his bad arm
movies,not_removed,city mac
movies,not_removed,hilarious
movies,not_removed,notice how wyatt russell is wearing up from
movies,not_removed,i was just wondering about the jersey too they were the highlanders in the first movie my guess is all those references to the highlanders but the different jersey means theres going to be some mighty ducks action like when they went from being the american team to being the ducks again
movies,not_removed,or maybe the obvious connection to being a team from halifax nova scotia
movies,not_removed,opens march in canada some other date in for usa
movies,not_removed,well it does say right in the title
movies,not_removed,what an incredibly pretentious comment
movies,not_removed,sorry were having all this fun over here that you arent a part of
movies,not_removed,it was a huge success in the hockey community and has quickly become a cult classic
movies,not_removed,seriously this isnt an unknown movie and i dont think ive met anyone who disliked it
movies,not_removed,k
movies,not_removed,i have to go with this conversation evgeni we should sign his dick everyone sign his dick doug glatt whats happening here oleg whats the matter you have a little pusspuss mommy whipped up a pussy pot pie huh evgeni lets see whats going on over there oleg show us your dick doug glatt i dont want you to see my dick oleg why you being gay marco i think youre fuckin being pretty gay oleg its not gay evgeni not if youre brothers marco if youre brothers its gay with a fuckin dash of something else doug glatt my brothers gay and he doesnt even do that marco ive been playing hockey my whole life i never fuckin signed no ones dick man john stevenson ill sign your dick doug
movies,not_removed,thats because everyone joins in hit a player you have a fight at a hockey game hit a goalie you have a riot with an audience
movies,not_removed,thats because goalies are crazy
movies,not_removed,goalies are vicious when they fight because theyre wearing so much armor and theyre used to having stone cold pucks shot at them faster than the average freeway speed limit they just dont give a shit
movies,not_removed,yes he was a goalie thats right i almost forgot he didnt played nhl or ahl though
movies,not_removed,enjoy
movies,not_removed,he was great in black mirror
movies,not_removed,hes also in jump street
movies,not_removed,was that the video game episode cause if so he was amazing in it
movies,not_removed,he was fantastic in everybody wants some
movies,not_removed,gotta disagree dude was great in black mirror
movies,not_removed,jay was one of the writers for the first goon but michael dowse directed the first one im very interested in goon since jay directed it
movies,not_removed,seann william scott was funny in role models i like the adult kid dynamic i loved might ducks all of them
movies,not_removed,i think he nails him
movies,not_removed,country mac is best mac city mac is just ronald mcdonald
movies,not_removed,just another example of the layers of subtlety weve come to expect from the franchise
movies,not_removed,i was half jokingmaking a conspiracy i understand the scottish aspect of nova scotia and east coast
movies,not_removed,i saw it it was fine still gonna file this under unnecessary sequel though
movies,not_removed,yea you dont have to be a dick but i watched the first movie and it sailed perfectly for me dont want another one to ruin it
movies,not_removed,doug why are you crying did you just watch rudy
movies,not_removed,true our junior games have a few antagonistic goalies its entertaining
movies,not_removed,for someone from an ice free continent why not the violence just the extra violence for a goalie
movies,not_removed,he played in europe before his injury him playing hockey is unique too cause his family is baseball so its cool they got so behind his hockey theyd go to games all over
movies,not_removed,thanks
movies,not_removed,nah hes just a red herring
movies,not_removed,that movie was bad though
movies,not_removed,everyone is great in black mirror even the bad ones does it really count i remember him now
movies,not_removed,oh my bad
movies,not_removed,shit my bad i was thinking country mac but typed city country mac kicked the shit out of that guy with a beer and his tshirt
movies,not_removed,im filing you under stfu
movies,not_removed,k
movies,not_removed,no thank you k
movies,not_removed,im from an ice free country at least hockey isnt as big here so i can relate to the confusion other players are out well playing getting involved they tackle and wrestle and earn grudges and disputes when they fight its because they have shit to settle any one on either team can understand that sometimes some player might hound another and a team member has enough and gets involved on behalf but again that player has earned that feud from his behaviour goalies are goalies a shot could make it to the goal from of the rink in one shot and with a single pass goalies live in their goal they arent out earning the hate building feuds and grudges so when someone starts on a goalie allies players get involved they want to defend their team mate from unreasonable aggression and also defend their goal also an injured goalie is a less effective goalie also penalties get handed out a lot teams can be a few players down fairly regularly but they cant afford to be down a goalie another reason they dont start shit or may hesitate to defend themselves but if your on the enemy team and someone hits a goalie and the opposing team jump your guy are you gonna sit back and watch guys dog pile your friend no so you react to their reaction and shit escalates its like a fight is a fight like a street fight but attacking your goalie is coming into your home and beating up your pets and kids you and everyone you know would defend that shit
movies,not_removed,i dont know if its possible for us to disagree more on anything ever but whatever its your opinion dude
movies,not_removed,yeah obviously it counts dude youre being ridiculous
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,got eeem
movies,not_removed,good argument
movies,not_removed,who cares
movies,not_removed,dont editorialize e onlines article title
movies,not_removed,uh nobody gave a shit about the first one a remake doesnt matter at all
movies,not_removed,i was around in and have never even heard of splash while ghostbusters was a big budget remake which managed to alienate fans of the hugely successful original i cant imagine that there is much of a fanbase that cares anything about splash it will be a low budget comedy which isnt expected to be a huge draw at the box office
movies,not_removed,is that considered poor reddiquette
movies,not_removed,yes it is
movies,not_removed,anyone know what kind of money these trailer editors make their skills are responsible for a multimillion dollar difference in box office intake does each studio have a bunch of them or are there a select few that do them all
movies,not_removed,dont watch this video scariest video on the internet very disturbing fucking creepy shit not for the weak of heart
movies,not_removed,i loved xxx as a kid but i had no idea there was enough interest in the film to warrant this i didnt even know they did a spin off thing either until recently i never knew other people even remembered xxx i was in like grade when this came out and hadnt heard anyone mention it since im glad its a thing though
movies,not_removed,a january release tells me everything i need to know
movies,not_removed,thumbs down the budget for that film should have been routed into the public interest or military salaries
movies,not_removed,so fast and furious with lesser cars more tattooed individuals and bigger explosions﻿
movies,not_removed,who tf asked for this shit diesel and his shit movies also i wonder whos replacing paul walker﻿
movies,not_removed,im glad its a thing though it isnt a thing xxx and sequel were garbage
movies,not_removed,obvious spam is obvious
movies,not_removed,yeah a six figure fine thatll show em they totally wont do that again every time non sarcastically when is the entertainment industry going to address the chinese elephant in the room they seem almost pathologically incapable of not stealing
movies,not_removed,what will disney do if they are all like no id imagine nothing that would affect the chinese company im also probably wrong and should have read the article
movies,not_removed,cause you make almost as much money in china doing films as you can in america
movies,not_removed,ah so being a large audience means they can or should get away with massive amounts of fraud and theft of ip
movies,not_removed,short answer yes
movies,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡° edit edward norton is in this
movies,not_removed,felt like a long episode that fit in somewhere near the end of the shows chronology the show is amazing and i love it the one thing i really disliked was the love interest it felt forced because its a movie and the formula calls for a female role thats not faye anyone who knows and loves the show knows that spike wouldnt look twice at any girl that wasnt julia
movies,not_removed,movies based on a television series are always hard to get righton the one hand you have to appeal to your fan base who love the show the movie is based off of and on the other you have to make a comprehensible enjoyable film that people who have never seen a single episode of the show will enjoy that being said i fail to see how this movie could have been any better killer action sequences cutting edge animation throughout a musical score that rivals the series in every way and character developing banter that is rooted in the crews personalities created in the show jet is left out of the loop by the other characters and is bitter about it faye gets into trouble thinking she can handle an easy bounty on her own ed and ein provide comic relief and offer a different perspective to central story events and spike is adamant about pretending he doesnt care about anything but making money from a job until pressed otherwise i love this movie not as much as the series but it serves as an excellent introduction to it to the uninitiated and as a great fan service to the shows devoted following would recommend
movies,not_removed,great analysis one of my favorite films have you read the book﻿
movies,not_removed,i dont think you can separate the movie from the book or really from the authors total output what is thomas p trying to say he is messing with you man and that may be the only meaning there is
movies,not_removed,love that film interesting analysis
movies,not_removed,i mean did anyone expected otherwise disney owns two of the biggest franchises in history star wars and mcu they swept the competition with those two alone
movies,not_removed,but as we all know they will claim a loss on every one of them
movies,not_removed,the ring
movies,not_removed,the blair witch project misery room chapter ps im in australia so i we have m instead of so its harder for me to remember good films seeing as some ms here are rs there please forgive me if i put any rs up there
movies,not_removed,drag me to hell
movies,not_removed,the boy came out pretty recent i havent seen it but i think its a pretty good movie
movies,not_removed,horror is that like a degrassi version of goosebumps
movies,not_removed,is that always wanted to see that after seeing scary movie
movies,not_removed,out of all those the only one ive seen is misery and i thought it was r but must have been mistaken edit checked it misery is rated r in usa
movies,not_removed,yeah blair witch is r here in the us
movies,not_removed,dont watch the boy
movies,not_removed,saw it really good better than the bullshit annabelle and the conjuring
movies,not_removed,what
movies,not_removed,yup its i just watched it for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised i saw scary movie so long ago but now i want to see it again
movies,not_removed,its may be but as i said its different rating here isnt too bad to deserve an r i remember my mother buying it for me on dvd when i was like lol freaked me the fuck out at the ending eat it eat it till you choke you sick twisted fuck so happy my mum showed year old me and my year old sister at the time that film
movies,not_removed,why
movies,not_removed,i thought the conjuring was one of the best horror movies to come out in the last decade the conjuring was really good too
movies,not_removed,its on netflix right now if im not mistaken yeah ill definitely check out the ring
movies,not_removed,amazing film though may be one of my favorite horror movies of all time
movies,not_removed,its one of the worst horror movies ive seen so far in everything about it is just awful i wouldnt recommend it to anyone its a january horror movie what could you expect anyway
movies,not_removed,not a horror lol
movies,not_removed,this whole post has been about horror films king is notorious for horror movies misery is most certainly one of them
movies,not_removed,its more of a thriller dude
movies,not_removed,this is pretty old news that rumor has been around for months
movies,not_removed,in real life renners character was a corrupt piece of shit they made him a much nicer in the movie
movies,not_removed,oh im sure but at least for the movie i think the moral ambiguityoverlying sadness of everything worked really well
movies,not_removed,because he was a democrat if those scams had landed republican politicians you can be sure the movie would not have been so kind
movies,not_removed,i honestly dont think the movie had much of the true narrative in mind
movies,not_removed,well didnt exist back then so it was either that or r they mustve decided it wasnt quite enough for an r rating
movies,not_removed,airplane had a pg rating and had boobs
movies,not_removed,poltergeist is one of the movies that helped create the rating
movies,not_removed,there wasnt yet also ratings have actually gotten stricter some pg films in the had boobs and bad language
movies,not_removed,didnt exist back then it wasnt bad enough for an r
movies,not_removed,that movie scared me when i was a kidnow ghosts dont scare me
movies,not_removed,why wouldnt it be pg poltergeist didnt have any sexual content it had very little bad language and nor was there significant violence there was very little gore its pretty hard to believe that this received such a mild rating especially in this may shock you but hollywood and by extension the us is more prudish now than it was in the
movies,not_removed,i know right i mean inside out got a pg as well and it does not feature a face literally falling of a dude
movies,not_removed,googled a bit and found httpswwwquoracomwhywaspoltergeistratedpg looks like the common belief is that it received its pg rating because spielberg appealed an r rating and mpaa listened because he was a hot director at the time
movies,not_removed,barbarella has a pg rating and more boobs pretty weird times then
movies,not_removed,swamp thing had boobs and a pg rating
movies,not_removed,true however i see nudity and bad language ethnic slurs aside as being pretty harmless and a natural part of everyday human existence gratuitous violence and gore are not though not that i was shocked by what i saw in poltergeist it served a function which is to scare you just surprised by the rating
movies,not_removed,forgetting about httpsiimgurcomxvbmmwwjpg little sequence interesting how the rating system has gotten a lot more conservative
movies,not_removed,i did forget about the guy pulling apart his own face so i edited my post
movies,not_removed,still one of the best villains in a comedy
movies,not_removed,
movies,not_removed,because the audio is mixed and mastered for a surround sound system like what you would get in a movie theater through such a system if the levels are adjusted correctly and its all tuned properly the dialog will be projected at a certain level from specific speakers while the action will be projected at a different level and sometimes an entirely different speakers the problem you describe comes about when you are listening on built in speakers on your tv or a poorly configured surround or just stereo sometimes system the solution if you are serious about watching movies from home invest in a good surround system that supports the newest audio standards and at least nice speakers depending on how big you want to go and big of a space you are covering is the most common setup but it is definitely possible and nice to do and a good subwoofer then get the setup configured by someone who knows about this sort of thing and can help you with optimal speaker placement and the proper levels for them
movies,not_removed,here is a link with some explanation of why it happens and some tips how to tweak your sound also i remember reading another reddit post about this a month or so ago if you dig to find it there may be some more answers
movies,not_removed,because the sound mix is meant for movie theatres where the top volume for explosions and the like is thunderously loud because that makes the action scenes feel much bigger and more intense they could make the dialog loud to match but that would be silly the same reason some scenes are dark and some are bright even though that makes it tough to make out the dark scenes with a home theatre that has bad contrast and sun glare on it
movies,not_removed,holy shit you cant just use the characters to give an example or something fuck
movies,not_removed,because action is actually very loud why wouldnt explosions and gun shots be louder than peoples voices if the noise bothers other people in the house try watching movies with a good set of headphones
movies,not_removed,httpswwwgooglecomqpublicenemiessoundmixing is definitely one i had my hand on the speaker for almost the entire movie it had possibly the worst sound mixing ive ever experienced from a big budget film
movies,not_removed,ex literally every movie you are getting way too bent out of shape over a reddit post man
movies,not_removed,im not its just kind of ridiculous should i make a self post and talk about a great shit i took in the post just to fill the word count
movies,not_removed,روعة شاهد وشارك أبيات شعرية لـ شاعر الثورة والمقاومة الشاعر الكبير مجيب الرحمن غنيم من جبهه نهم شرق العاصمة صنعاء
movies,not_removed,watch lotr in order and pretend the hobbit films dont exist at all
movies,not_removed,watch fellowship two towers and return of the king the hobbit trilogy could have easily been one long film and it added a lot of stuff that was nowhere in the original book it felt like the marketing department got control of the script and started adding random stuff because they thought it would sell more toys or there had to be a romantic interest or there had to be cameos for the lotr characters
movies,not_removed,i dont understand why these questions are always asked just watch the movies in the order they came out
movies,not_removed,watch the extended editions of lotr
movies,not_removed,all these what order should i watch this series in questions always have the same response order of release
movies,not_removed,watch lotr first if you liked them then check out hobbit afterwards that way if you dont like lotr you dont spend more time wondering if itll get better like you would if you started with and didnt enjoy the hobbit movies for what its worth i enjoyed the hobbit movies for what they were even though it doesnt seem like the popular opinion around here
movies,not_removed,release order like a normal person
movies,not_removed,hobbit can be skipped unless you just need more of middle earth if you can get the extended versions of the lotr trilogy my god is it worth it no films extended versions even hold a candle to those they add so much depth explore the world in more detail and just changed how i understood the films especially with the return of the king it adds minutes highly recommend
movies,not_removed,i think with any franchise you watch it in the order it was released
movies,not_removed,dont watch the hobbit movies and watch lotr in order
movies,not_removed,release order
movies,not_removed,yeah watch the original lotr trilogies and if you loved them and want more i guess watch the hobbit movies the hobbit movies just dont have the same magic the original trilogy did
movies,not_removed,get high and play
movies,not_removed,i watched them for the first time a couple months ago i got all the extended versions of all and watched the hobbit movies first and then lotr movies watching extended the first time and watching the hobbit movies first goes against everything most fans say to do but imo i thought it was great and worked well
movies,not_removed,you dont need to watch the hobbit movies at all i watched the first one and didnt bother with the other two they werent really bad or anything but they dont add anything to the lotr trilogy
movies,not_removed,the order in which they were released
movies,not_removed,the hobbits first its in order with the plot and theyre not bad movies just not as good as the lotd movies
movies,not_removed,watch the lord of the rings trilogy in release order and then either find one of the decent fan edits of the hobbit or just youtube the riddles in the dark scene
movies,not_removed,when you wanna see both trilogies anyway than the story line is the hobbits lord of the rings
movies,not_removed,i suggest starting with the hobbit films however thry do include a lot of detail about rings especially in the extended versions which can be confusing so i sometimes suggest watching the prologue of fellowship of the ring up until the line and in the gloom of gollums cave it waited also be aware theres some discontinuity between the hobbit films and lotr but i think overall its better to start with them
movies,not_removed,how i clearly state in that i mean do i watch the hobbit or the lotr movies first
movies,not_removed,i understand what youre saying but i mean do i watch the hobbit or the lotr movies first
movies,not_removed,you can skip the hobbit but youll want to watch lotr as and actually came out first its like star wars if that makes sense
movies,not_removed,i hope this is an april fools post because you sir are a fucking dumb cunt
movies,not_removed,are the hobbit films that bad of movies or do they just ruin the lotr movies
movies,not_removed,best advice here the lord of the rings movies are great the hobbit movies are god knows how many hours of nothing happening at all as they excruciatingly eke out a page in large print book into hours of film
movies,not_removed,i disagree while not as good as the lotr trilogy the first hobbit movies are very solid although i dont have a lot of good things to say about third
movies,not_removed,the hobbit trilogy could have easily been one long film yeah somebody made a three hour supercut from all three movies its just about perfect
movies,not_removed,i get this opinion but since the hobbit films are prequels i was just curious if the viewing experience of watching them is better
movies,not_removed,well i meant the lotr trilogy or the hobbit films first
movies,not_removed,why is everyone with this opinion getting downvoted its the best way to go watch all three hobbits first because theyre not terrible but theyre good and they take place before the lord of the rings then watch the lord of the rings movies
movies,not_removed,thank you for your input
movies,not_removed,what
movies,not_removed,wait what
movies,not_removed,aprils fools
movies,not_removed,theyre not horrible movies but theyre remarkably dull very aggravating forgettable blockbusters if they had no connection to one of the greatest trilogies of all time you wouldnt know they exist
movies,not_removed,my suggestion is to watch the lotr trilogy then just read the hobbit book its a simple book and you can go through it pretty easily saving hours of dull adaptation
movies,not_removed,theyre just not as visually interesting or epic as the original series of movies are like you can see all of the love and time that was put into the lotr movies on screen in every frame and its something that just isnt present in the hobbit movies especially the one like umansefson said if they werent tied to lotr the movies wouldnt have existed in the first place and i shudder to imagine when they eventually try to squeeze extra money out of the series by attempting an adaptation of the silmarillion ugh
movies,not_removed,theyre overly long poorly made with inconsistent theme and style peter jackson had to come onboard very late in preproduction for del turo and the movies never really recovered the studios also mandated movies rather than one or two and so the movies are stuffed with boring padding and extra plotlines not in the book one of the biggest problem is that bilbo is almost never the star of his own movies the second biggest problem is that the movie cant decide if they want to be slapstick childrens stories or serious lotr knock offs they try to do both and fail miserably watch a few clips on youtube the dwarf song at bilbos house is great bilbo and gollum riddling in the dark are phenomenal the rest blows
movies,not_removed,the hobbit films are to lord of the rings what the prequels are to star wars
movies,not_removed,watch them once even if you absolutely love the lotr movies you will never feel the need to watch the hobbit more than once its just boring and forgettable
movies,not_removed,theyre pretty good fun if you dont expect too much unfortunately theyve been cursed by the snowball effect of poor internet public opinion
movies,not_removed,put it this way ur question confused me until ur comment reminded me of the hobbit movies
movies,not_removed,have you actually seen it because if you have youd know its pretty fucking far from perfect
movies,not_removed,there are a lot of things that happen in the hobbit films that are really only meaningful if youve seen lord of the rings already which isnt really a good thing in this case but i digress
movies,not_removed,again order of release
movies,not_removed,because they are not good and range from mediocre to terrible probably
movies,not_removed,theyre not horrible movies battle of five armies is most definitely a horrible movie
movies,not_removed,alright thank you for your input
movies,not_removed,the bits with smaug are also worth watching
movies,not_removed,the lord of the rings is a property with a higher standard than pretty fun
movies,not_removed,anything in particular you didnt like
movies,not_removed,theyre not that bad theyre actually pretty decent it should have been only two movies but theyre still decent
movies,not_removed,was expecting a lotr style battle scene there was bigger armies in gangs of new york
movies,not_removed,personally i find the hobbit prequels to be far worse than the star wars prequels i think you should watch the first three lotr movies and if you like them id say try hobbit just know what youre getting intomuch lighter tone i think there are a few scenes that made watching the hobbit worth it if youre a big fan and who knows you may love the hobbit
movies,not_removed,talking about the hobbitns there bud
movies,not_removed,should have been one fucking movie as the goddamned book was the length of an archie comic and shorter than any one book of lotr
movies,not_removed,id say the hobbit films are average unfortunately theyre also fucking long which makes average painful
movies,not_removed,yeah everybody knows that but its useless as a comment on the films im not the biggest fan but if someone says how are these movies and your answer is the book was short then your feedback isnt helpful
movies,not_removed,such am emotional scene 😕 the pain and emotion jeremy holds in his voice is one that one shall never forget 😮 such a talented man this is the best scene in the movie ❤ its amazing how you see jeremys characters attitude change from a rogue maniac to the caring individual he becomes upon discovering beckhams body to this very scene throughout the film ﻿
movies,not_removed,i think they should save marvel zombies for the netflix series stuff
movies,not_removed,if they didnt let edgar wright make a movie in his personal style they wont let ben wheatley within feet of marvels headquarters
movies,not_removed,that would be so awesome pretty soon they could start making what if movies too thatd be cool
movies,not_removed,id love to see his take on marvel zombies but it would never happen although ben wheatley would be great for a dr strange or fantastic four movie if they got the rights back
movies,not_removed,please no im burned out on zombie stuff
movies,not_removed,the only way this gets made is if they pull a dark knight returns and make an animated movie that gets maybe two weeks in theaters and then gets released on digital
movies,not_removed,be amazed if we ever see a marvel zombies but you never know maybe elements of it could be incorporated into a future film
movies,not_removed,what i like about marvel zombies is that they were lucid while eating people some felt remorse and some just went with it fresh idea for a zombie flick
movies,not_removed,thatd be great but it seems almost too dark for marvel and disney to try their hand at it also seems like something they would avoid since it cant easily fit in their mcu
movies,not_removed,i feel like marvel zombies would work better as a short film like willie lumpkin the fantastic fours mailman brings his niece to work one day they accidentally get teleported to the mzu by mister fantastic and thirty seconds later they come back all grungy and gross after months of fighting the zombie avengers willie has caps shield and is wearing black panthers armor and billie has spidermans webshooters and hawkeyes bow willie billie billie yes uncle will willie lets not tell your parents about this okay billie deal
movies,not_removed,given that free fire was a bit shit im not enthusiastic about this news free fire was minutes of material stretched to minutes it got old fast
movies,not_removed,the zombies of marvel zombies still retain their abilities and their personalities not interested to be honest sounds more like a social satire zombies should not have layers nor be like tiramisu
movies,not_removed,wow did not know that really seems more dcs style to me either way will be seeking these out thanks
movies,not_removed,right i think itd be the jumping the shark moment in an already saturated marveldc movie market
