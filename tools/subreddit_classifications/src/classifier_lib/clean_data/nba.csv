frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood may you choke on the queasy convulsing nausea of your own trite foolish beliefs you are weary stale flat and unprofitable you are grimy squalid nasty and profane you are foul and disgusting youre a fool an ignoramus monkeys look down on you even sheep wont have sex with you you are unreservedly pathetic starved for attention and lost in a land that reality forgot and what meaning do you expect your delusional selfimportant statements of unknowing inexperienced opinion to have with us what fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your

not hear from me again for a while i dont have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia or any of the rest of this drivel duhthe only thing worse than your logic is your manners i have snipped away most of what you wrote because well it didnt really say anything your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful i mean really

nba,removed,hi heres a summary of the term strawman a httprationalwikiorgwikistrawman is logical fallacy that occurs when a debater httprationalwikiorgwikiredherring their opponents argument as a weaker version and rebuts that weak fake version rather than their opponents genuine argument intentional strawmanning usually has the goal of avoiding real debate against their opponents real argument because the misrepresenter risks losing in a fair debate or making the opponents position appear ridiculous and thus win over bystanders unintentional misrepresentations are also possible but in this case the misrepresenter would only be guilty of simple ignorance while their argument would still be fallacious they can be at least

nba,removed,hello rnba for someone who vaguely knows the rules of basketball but wants to get more into it and learn more in depth whats going on what would you suggest how should i go about picking a team to follow i follow baseball very closely but ive recently wanted to get into pro basketball as it seems like a blast for reference my baseball team is the padres im pretty against supporting any team from la or the bay area idk if this is too on topic for the free talk thread also are there specific team subs for each team like there is for baseball thanks for any replies
nba,removed,the point is there its hyperbole
nba,removed,
nba,removed,donald trump is president
nba,removed,lmao howd that ass taste today
nba,removed,what are you getting at i feel bad about making fun of a middle schooler but look into the difference between relative difference and absolute difference also what about curry having more steals what about harden having more turnovers youre saying curry didnt play quarters like theres a min difference here but its only right which is why i brought up the per stats
nba,removed,you think you would
nba,removed,go fuck yourself
nba,removed,congrats go fuck yourself
nba,removed,he looks just as stupid as he acts fucking idiot
nba,removed,this is one hundred percent censorship and its frankly horseshit how is a player or coach in the nba talking about politics to the public media not relevant to this sub how are you to tell us fans what is relevent donald sterling was an entirely political event are you going to tell me that would be censored this is absolutely cowardly and disgusting this is how the evils of the world keep existing because of the people being kept quiet and uninformed i was being neutral in my other comment but it has to be said anyone who hates and agrees with politics to not be apart of sports are privaledged people most of whom are probably white who dont have to deal with the everyday consequences of the status quo unfortunately the results of this election have a direct contrast to the culture that is part of the nba not the fan culture necesssarily but most definitely a majority of players i dont need to go into a history lesson on how the climate of the individuals this sport that is of a majority africanamericans could be affected socially and economically by the ignorance of this country they have to use their voice and their platform to speak for all those who cannot be heard and you are censoring what they members of the nba community are revealing openly in public and frankly if i had to guess its because some people here are trump supporters whose egos are as fragile as his is because those are the only people being coddle by this horrible horrible petty decision
nba,removed,for anyone blaming that on jameer why the fuck didnt any get open for him to pass to
nba,removed,i recall a ms jeannie buss once proclaim that her heralded lakers would never resort to such lowly tactics she should be looked at for trumps team

nba,removed,i thought trump was going to make america great again this is bullshit
nba,removed,shut up bro yall suck too yall got literally banners of any kind in your stadium
nba,removed,i thought trump declared an end to brandon knight carnage
nba,removed,nba superstar nikola vučević also known as vooch the juice or my newest nickname for him the answer is better than both of these men for the following reasons he is taller he is very handsome and not from america so hes mysterious while brady endorsed trump and james endorsed clinton voochi mane i saw this somewhere and liked it didnt get involved in stupid political affairs like a dummy but if he wanted to get involved in politics he could be the president and would be the best one ever

nba,removed,you fool its comparing their stats when their team played each other it doesnt specifically say who was guarding who and youre calling me dumb lol gtfo
nba,removed,i never disputed whether kobe lead his team to straight finals you made it seem like they were undefeated which is why i said that
nba,removed,ah so you dont have one so shut the fuck up
nba,removed,what is that supposed to prove you just posted their minutes you didnt show who was guarding who lmao keep searching buddy
nba,removed,the new way to lie is to call something an alternative fact according to the trump administration spokesperson
nba,removed,someone from trumps pr team said in an interview that trump doesnt tell lies just alternative facts
nba,removed,lol i gave you the source head to head search up kobe vs a singular defender and look at game log for each one come on buddy i just directly gabe you the source
nba,removed,lol lol reading comprehension i have never told you to look at offensive plus minus i said look at on off numbers for both players jesus fucking christ
nba,removed,well if i thought rnba downvoting someone with a dissenting opinion meant that someone was wrong id be a retard like the rest of you

nba,removed,see the problem is with controversial is that it shows ones with lots of upvotes and downvotes first heres a much better solution for popcorn take the reddit url youre currently at when viewing all the comments in this case replace httpwwwredditcom with navigate to the new url in your browser for example in this case its now wait for the page to load then scroll to the bottom and work your way up all the most downvoted comments including the ones mods deleted
nba,removed,im hoping the cavs get swept
nba,removed,if this were in the avatar universe gsw would be airbenders waterbenders while cavs are earthbenders and firebenders

nba,removed,reddit always does this and it makes me question if theyve ever played basketball he caught it right under the hoop it is a way easier motion to lay it up then suddenly dunk it

nba,removed,yeah no shit you dumb cunt it wouldve stopped the clock the spurs wouldve only been down at most and couldve run a play that didnt have to be shot in less than a second the only people that cant see what garbage these refs are are blind thunder fans like yourselves helped you win game and
nba,removed,however having watched every second of these games thus far its pretty easy to see which team is getting the worst of it especially in the closing minutes once again its like you read none of what i said take your homer glasses off they make you look like a huge douche
nba,removed,yep it really speaks to the way in which humans judge people people love saying that theyre not racist but how come the blacker a dude is the less hes allowed to be expressive on the basketball court how come a white dude in a rock band can say faggot in a song and it doesnt even get mentioned but make the white dude a rapper and hes a topic on cnn
nba,removed,kill yoself
nba,removed,i would love to see of the asshats on reddit respond to this one i am pretty sure grammar nazis and reddit mods base their worth on being able to correct others seriously below rapist and child killer are reddit mod on the usefulness scale in lifeyou are a sad sad human do you tell your mom and your cats how you ban people from things on the internet
nba,removed,it doesnt need to be said because if you dont understand it by now you should die
nba,removed,i respectfully disagree faggot

nba,removed,i feel like duncan garnett and nowitzki should all have a farewell tour together next year thats more than my heart can take so i will be dead before they gone im glad i got that going for me
nba,removed,yeah nigga
nba,removed,i play in high school nothing serious so
nba,removed,thats not my argument i didnt say leaving someone open was an example of good defense but when you prevent a team from taking a better shot thats a win youre once again demonstrating your total lack of knowledge of defense all so you can be a smug ass bay area faggot also remember how much your team struggled in in different series against majorly injured teams everyone else sure does you keep being happy about other peoples accomplishments though especially when theyre irrelevant anyway you do you man if you want to keep chasing currys little dick like the bay area fuckboy you are thats your business ill enjoy my life regardless of where its at ill also enjoy my team because my team will earn what it gets unlike your entitled team that will get beaten any time they face a real challenge but then i guess youll be there to make excuses for them wont you
nba,removed,this comment was the top comment of the day on june i am a bot for rtopcommentoftheday please report suggestionsconcerns to the mods
nba,removed,aww whats wrong little faggot cant handle some hurtful words in return do you need to cry about it i hear klays hosting a support group for sore losers maybe itll help if you shit on my state some more at least now itd be called for the warriors couldnt handle the defensive intensity of the game is that simple enough for you regardless of openness or whatever they missed their shots i never gave cleveland full credit for holding them to just as i never gave golden state credit for holding the cavs to whatever they were it was a tense minutes of basketball that clearly couldve gone to either team if they rose to the challenge the warriors did not the cavs did and they played stellar defense to boot my point is the cavs defense was very effective especially in the final minutes despite giving up open looks in crunch time they ran the warriors ragged the whole game and theres a reason that team scored points
nba,removed,aww someones trying to use big words like diatribes to make himself sound smart i better give you a gold star oh by the way youre a gigantic bitch who couldnt ball if you tried and you should stop talking about shit you dont understand and insulting states you know nothing about because you cant take another team getting even a little bit of credit go fuck yourself fag boy

nba,removed,solid proof of what lmao i think we all know youre the one who gets no pussy when you spend all day with lebrons dick shoved down your throat for real get help though
nba,removed,he reenacted mlk lebron is a modernday hero
nba,removed,harden lebron durant westbrook kawhi in order
nba,removed,howd you like that game tonight im willing to bet that hurt you worse than any magic loss this season
nba,removed,you constantly shit on cavs fans whats your problem upset that lebron said he wasnt into men
nba,removed,stupid legal sea foods when i flew out to boston everyone told me not to go there but i thought how bad could it be i went and had the catfish burger and it sucked
nba,removed,deflopgate analysis spot on
nba,removed,no ill take my downvotes like a fucking man unlike lequeen who pussies out
nba,removed,did you even watch the nba hes openly admitted he ate too much to put on weight so the sixers wouldnt draft him youre an idiot tbh
nba,removed,look that list was made in and if i was bothered to update it it would have more accomplishments on it so chill jazzbro
nba,removed,no its not u fkin looser
nba,removed,fuck off lebron is a straightup flopping bitch whos insanely good at basketball and btw so is most of your babyasssoft clippers team
nba,removed,eat a dick and go back to sobbing about how bad rondo and wade are
nba,removed,found the lecock sucker
nba,removed,no because who they are in real life translate to their game take carmelo anthony for example hes a selfish glory seeker who gets easily jealous of others that translate to how he plays the game with on iso ball so he can be looked atas better than he really is he doesnt have the mental strength to lead a team to a championship because his laziness off the oourt translate to on the court
nba,removed,tfw the cavs win and get upvotes but when the warriors win they get less then votes fuck yall lebron dickriders
nba,removed,yeah bennett really marinated well that nigga went off
nba,removed,tell me how its worse ill call you a dipshit after you post your stupid response
nba,removed,lebron is such a bitch it was a foul not even a particularly hard foul soccer players would be proud of that flop
nba,removed,yeah but i didnt edit that in everything else was from
nba,removed,rings by dick riding the otherslol
nba,removed,that game was absolutely brutal like the warriors were exacting revenge for something not sure what but i sense it has to do with blowing some sort of lead late last season
nba,removed,needle dick
nba,removed,could you express your point more clear
nba,removed,nobody is saying that you made that up in your head
nba,removed,hes the donald trump of sports
nba,removed,youre well spokenfor a lakers fan
nba,removed,would that even be the least bit satisfying for klay a three at the end of game in the finals vs a block in an mlk game lol
nba,removed,so saying this person is well spoken is the exact same thing as saying oh my god i thought this guy was an idiot thats what im arguing uyouneedproofs made that up in his head its total bullshit and you know it
nba,removed,first there was the valentines day massacre now we have the martin luther king day massacres
nba,removed,
nba,removed,hes a machine for
nba,removed,nope youre wrong people can be extremely smart but not well spoken youre making the argument that every single time someone mentions how well spoken someone else is then they also believed that person was stupid beforehand your opinion is ignorant and its total bullshit you know this just stop
nba,removed,i agree with its one game in january
nba,removed,im making the argument that the discrepancy between how often someone says a black person is wellspoken vs a white person irrefutably implies that there is a lower set of expectations for black athletes in terms of intelligenceeloquence no it doesnt you think it does irrefutably implies lol prove it your entire argument hinges on knowing the implication of every person who makes that comment its straight up impossible for you to know this its pure bullshit we might disagree but theres no reason to be such an asshole you throw around racism accusations yet youre the one making sweeping generalizations about people if youre gonna do that then im going to be an asshole toward you because clearly you dont care about trashing other people for things you make up in your head my argument is simple dont go around calling other people racists if you dont have any idea what their intent is its bullshit and im not going to be nice about it dont like it then stop making generalizations about things you dont know every human is different
nba,removed,that was bad
nba,removed,there was zero playoff intensity from the cavs none of their trademark harassment of steph i feel like this was almost a thrown game
nba,removed,dude this is all speculative first if i say someone is well spoken thats not an admission of racism you dont know my intent second is it not possible that someone can be smart yet not well spoken you cant prove your claim without knowing every single persons intent youre speaking in generalizations its impossible to know each persons intent if you wanna go around calling everyone a racist for every little slight then go ahead i prefer to save that title for people that i know are racists you dont know shit about this reddit communitys intentions unless you know each one of us personally but you dont youre wrong
nba,removed,its hard to tell if it made them better but i think if anything it helps them improve their team chemistry and learn from their mistakes
nba,removed,kyrie
nba,removed,honestly asshole fans are what make rivalries great they have personality i enjoy it also it makes it all so much better when they lose
nba,removed,i do understand the difference and what im saying is that i believe people like you and op use racist implications and racist interchangeably im also saying your argument is essentially saying that any compliment toward a person of color could have racial implications if taken in that context i could say westbrook has nice taste in clothes and some jerkoff douche could say oh because hes black youre surprised he has good taste in clothes you racist your argument is so flimsy it hinges on the idea that people use well spoken more often about black people so it must come from an inherently racist place im telling you unless you know the speakers intention youre just inventing this negative characteristic about the speaker even though you dont know himher dont throw around racist accusations unless you know for a fact that the person is racist its common sense everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt if i say wade is well spoken people like you read that and think oh well this person is inherently racist thats really fucking stupid
nba,removed,theres also the whole not showing up for work and not telling anybody thing
nba,removed,i dont think you do see the difference no i dont think you see the difference you go around policing others on their language based on a hunch that what theyre saying might be racist and thats enough evidence for you to go ahead and try to browbeat them into being as progressive as you think you are being you say racial implications when we both know thats just your roundabout way of calling someone a racist youre not slick with that shit i cant control how you perceive someone criticizing someone else for being ignorant whats ignorant here who makes that decision you you must be so fucking full of yourself dude however you deserve to be called out for engaging in rhetoric that is flatly insensitive so now calling a person of color well spoken is flatly insensitive newsflash dipshit you dont know everyones intent is it impossible for you to not speak in sweeping generalizations i bet you see yourself as so progressive when really this pc police bullshit you peddle is doing nothing but furthering the divide among races youre looking for problems where there is none good intentions do not mean you can say whatever you want without fear of being called out on it okay lets do that then you go around telling other people what is and isnt okay to say you try to police the language used by others im sure you have good intentions but those intentions have clearly gotten muddied by your opinion of white people as a whole now its reached a point where if anyone says that a black person is well spoken then they must be racist fuck your good intentions those intentions have led you to blindly call people racists based off of one innocent compliment youre so far up your own ass that you think youre the decider of what is and isnt acceptable on top of that and this is the only part that matters my argument was that op said saying someone is well spoken is the exact same thing as saying oh wow i thought this guy was an idiot again you can be smart without being well spoken i bet youre white
nba,removed,when cavs won off a horse shit call cowherd and nose wright were screaming how warriors can never beat the cavs in the finals now warriors blow them out and this game didnt matter and cavs didnt try lebron dickriders are pathetic
nba,removed,im here to shitpost and i dont care who knows it fambrughini now flair up or shutup
nba,removed,except this just isnt what rpm espns version does at all its not a mismash of box score stats like per that shoots out a number its a complicated and encompassing stat taking multiple years of onoff and lineup data to measure a players impact article can give you a decent idea of where it comes from klays dprm seems probably a little low because he has consistently played ahead of really great backup defenders like iggy and livingston since his replacements typically outperformed him on d through no fault of his own theyre just really good the holistic data may have him look a little worse than he is hence its own shortcomings for the record a is a replacement level rpm so his is still pretty good stats dont lie but if you dont know actually what they means and their own shortcomings then you can draw some pretty crappy conclusions
nba,removed,bahahahahaha fucking idiot
nba,removed,shouldnt the warriors be the queens because of the whole san francisco thing
nba,removed,stand up comedian flop to producer flop
nba,removed,christ man thedonald is that way last response and then ill let you return to your maycomb county safe space i dont even know what that means and whats ironic is that youre trying to police language so that this place can be more of a safe space for you youre the one who is offended the hypocrisy here is hilarious i dont consider it unfair to take issue with a demeaning characterization of black people as not normally intelligentarticulate again theres no proof of that you have slowly upped the racism in well spoken throughout your responses to the point that youre now claiming its a demeaning characterization of black people as not normally intelligentarticulate thats a fucking hunch that youre making about the intent of others you say it like its fact now damn dude youre incapable of being honest in your argument when that is almost exclusively used to describe a person of color then yes it is extremely insensitive here we find another exaggeration you say now that it is almost exclusively used to describe black people bullshit you made that up show me the statistics to back that up show me where it says that only white people ever refer to black people as well spoken lolol extremely offensive you keep exaggerating more and more next youre gonna say that it is literally hitler i bet youre one of those people who believes that racism ended when obama was elected and that theres no such thing as institutional racism the fuck no dude thats ignorant like you if someone unintentionally says something racist they should be called out on it saying this person is well spoken is not racist you just want it to be so you can flex your pc muscles and feel important learn the fucking difference and stop crying youre not a victim and neither am i youre the one crying because someone said well spoken you look like the crybaby to me dude heres a group of statements point to the one thats racist anthony davis is black anthony davis is good at basketball anthony davis is well spoken heres another statement tell me if this is racist black person wow eminem is a good rapper using your logic this last statement must be racist because the black person is surprised that a white person could be good at rapping its inherently racist to say this do you see now how stupid your argument is bottom line i believe everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt i believe everyone deserves to be treated like my equal until they show me otherwise its the golden rule you believe that its your job to tell other people how racist they are because of a hunch you have you have no proof just a hunch but thats enough for you to judge others right go back to tumblr with your institutionalized racism microaggression bullshit
nba,removed,bro hes better then me at basketball and im some people are just more athletically gifted cant wait for this lebron minion to dominate years down the line
nba,removed,this is the most lefty reddit cuck circlejerk thread about perceived and imagined racismdiscrimination ive come across in a while could it simply be that for decades the majority of athletes regardless of race when interviewed have struggled to give articulate answers because they get paid to play not speak so when you come across someone who speaks well and gives thoughtful non generic answers it really stands out not everything is some hidden bias or discrimination ffs
nba,removed,its fruity as hell but thats okay by me
nba,removed,he hasnt been a great defender this year look at the advanced stats i love it
nba,removed,sure there is picking that number tells the story that ever since lebron hit a lowpoint in shooting during a slump last season he has actually been very good from for quite a long stretch time he could have picked or whatever but is the longest actual stretch of games that doesnt skew that number so why not go for that i for one found this stat quite interesting as i wouldnt have guessed that myself when i think of lebrons shooting in his second stint with cleveland i think of him being less than stellar overthinking his shot and at some point halfway through the finals he regained his confidence in his shot this stat tells me that this isnt necesarrily true and that james actually has been somewhat consistent with his shot for a longer stretch of time than i at first would have though thank you thinking back to the finals when the spurs butchered miami in games i dont think ive ever seen lebrons shooting as on point in my opinion he played his most consistant finals series ever that year despite them loosing if he could regain that confidence in his shot he could extend his prime a few years perhaps
nba,removed,there was no pace he lit on fire in the quarter to say he wouldve dropped your pretty full of yourself and also if u see someone with a different opinion no need to be butthurt tough guy i swear this sub is full of entitled bitches who been watching basketball for like years lol
nba,removed,spurs suck ass lol how is this team in the league
nba,removed,does anyone actually believe this spurs team is a contender they absolutely suck
nba,removed,losing to the magic jazz and a and blakeless clippers thats trash
nba,removed,while losing to the jazz and magic at home also losing to the clippers without and blake thats trash
nba,removed,well i cant find one from the summer but you can find trade rumors for him and la and now with millsap being on the trade block it seems possible

nba,removed,you really suck kobe off dont you
nba,removed,interesting piece on possible trade packages for him
nba,removed,will the sack be in the trade too though
nba,removed,then why bother answering idiot
nba,removed,holy shit youre a moron
nba,removed,youre butthurt because lebron made your franchise irrelevant in the last decade
nba,removed,westbrook is averaging less turnovers per game than harden right now if you actually look at the numbers and watch the games youd probably have a better understanding the thunder played without their second best player for almost a third of the season so getting oladipo back is going to help the to numbers because theres another goto go for okc if you wanna keep being a condescending douche thats your business but russell westbrook is a better player than james harden so go fuck yourself
nba,removed,shotselection
nba,removed,dont be intentionally stupid
nba,removed,because thibodeau doesnt have a roster of seasoned vets and an mvp point guard with which he used to establish his reputation also wiggins and towns are chill

nba,removed,grrm is famously terrible with size scale his description of the wall is so insanely over scaled as is his iron throne i think you can find artistic drawings of what his would actually look like compared to the show i wouldnt be surprised if he originally meant to only make the mountain feet tall i cant remember how big ser duncan was supposed to be
nba,removed,he was the teams dennis rodman lmfaooooooooo dude never averaged more than rpg and you are comparing him to dennis fucking rodman tristan thompson is times the player that haslem ever was and i wouldnt even venture to ever comapre him to dennis rodman thats hilarious cleveland booing lebron his first game back when i saw this i was like damn i love this hate glad you posted this love it thats what a passionate fan base looks like glad lebron gets to enojy actual fans on a nightly basis of to put up with the ass fans miami hows it feel that miami is now a footnote in the book of always remember to
nba,removed,i said he was the teams dennis rodman nah as i said he was your teams anderson varejao a few good years but mostly a career scrub passionate heres an unbiased article coming out from cleveland that shows you how passionate cav fans are lmao lmfaoooooooo theres a difference between a few people leaving when the game is out of reach and the whole stadium leaving when its a four point game dont be a fucking moron miami fans arrive late and leave early on a consistent basis theres a reason the heat had to come out with guidelines telling heat fans how to act you guys had one of the most talented teams of all timeand the fan engagement coordinators had to tell the fans how to be fans hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha i dont think all of miami fans are bad you seem like a like an alright guy and pretty knowledgeable fan but the average miami fan is terrible there is no debating that
nba,removed,no we dont you fucking autist
nba,removed,whats funny you stupid asshole this is true af
nba,removed,shut up fag boi
nba,removed,lol you simple bitch the olympics were boycotted because of the communist backlash against the boycotting of the summer olympics in moscow it was a political issue dipshit the olympics at worst were considered overwhelming or overcrowded the attendance was through the roof and the worst issues revolved around overdone coporate sponsorships the olympics were an overwhelming success in terms of competition quality and revenue you are cherry picking the facts there im not going to even get into why blaming the weather on the americans in the world cup is beyond retarded sorry we run soccer better than you
nba,removed,youre a fucking retard real life nba isnt like you cant just sign players because you have cap space
nba,removed,thank you so much for this udrivenbycars there is a poster in our pistons sub who literally will not stop arguing with me though i guess im as complicit as he in responding and he is hellbent on telling me all advanced stats are wrongbut supplies no actual reason other than youre stat is wrong you are wrong this gives me a concise way to explain certain aspects thanks

nba,removed,oh okay so that warrants chucking the ball at him as hard as you can
nba,removed,thats more of a meth area
nba,removed,if you believe the number your just ignorant and need to take an elementary stats classseriously any rationally thinking adult would be skeptical of a self proclaimed unsourced claim like this maybe its the christian school thing but seriously where is your inner skeptic

nba,removed,still for me lmao
nba,removed,seriously they should also not count the celtics first few championships

nba,removed,
nba,removed,spoken like a true white male
nba,removed,this dominican looking ass lol
nba,removed,bro thats racist af
nba,removed,i think it has a lot to do with how these stars carry themselves on and off the court in todays new and social media environment fans and media get to know these athletes and their personalities in unprecedented ways i think lebron and westbrook have offthecourt personalities that are more likely to rub fans the wrong way inducing harsh criticism in these situations whereas softspoken and mellow personalities like kawhi durant and curry create an environment where media and fans are more likely to cut them slack in these types of situations and hold back on the harsh criticism
nba,removed,the west was trash this season beating up bad teams does not mean you are a good team outside of gs and sa okc went just against and above teams la went portland went dallas went memphis went and hou went how the hell is that good and then in the east everyone in the top pretty much had the same record but toronto was the best at gs is not a legit win team so them winning makes everyone believe that the west is very good if cleveland was in the west instead of gs they would be right now and everyone would be saying the west sucks and east is better
nba,removed,why does klay guard westbrook when curry defence is soooooo goood
nba,removed,i got to about the third line where you said i think and stopped right there here is a little tip for you nobody cares what you think use facts dont mention your own opinions that have no ethos they dont matter at all
nba,removed,kd ur so gay lol
nba,removed,thanks for further proving your basketball ignorance the defense allowed back then doesnt compare to defense now considering in jordans era zone defense was banned and it isnt now defense has become immesenly more complex with a lot more switching ect more defense is allowed now lol and i can find a lot of sports analysts who will say that btw

nba,removed,i got it when i was like
nba,removed,delicious
nba,removed,right she was a great coach one of the greatest of all time that doesnt necessarily mean she had an nba leave basketball iq half the coaches in the nba dont

nba,removed,dayum karine is smart too shes a keeper for sure
nba,removed,this is for you to make a part year age pic httpiimgurcomzvggtfljpg year age pic year age pic why would these exist at all considering if he is he would be in the us since year

nba,removed,theres really no correlation between gun laws and safety youll note both states which support the and ban portions of it away in both low and high firearm death areas banning guns and creating arbitrary laws only serves to make the ignorant feel unrightfully safe in the last years weve seen a greater effort within cities to cut down on gang related violence and issues in areas of great poverty and adversity focusing on our poor with little options is where focus should be but you cant just legislate that away and make everyone feel good and then get votes
nba,removed,except op cuz he is a faggot
nba,removed,shes bae
nba,removed,i mean its and obvious choicebianca is way more funner

nba,removed,can we nominate people in this thread
nba,removed,how are upsets compromising to competitive integrity you just sound autistic
nba,removed,
nba,removed,totally agree with you that theres no easy answer but i think its also important to consider that being a victim of actual rape and having your name publicized and being falsely accused of raping someone and having your name publicized are not even remotely comparable not implying you said anything of the sort just making a follow up statement also its important to remember that the statistics surrounding false rape accusations are staggeringly low anywhere from according to social scientists source below given that anywhere from of rape allegations are legitimate im naturally more inclined to be concerned about the right to privacy for the alleged victim than i am the accused this is not to say that the accused is automatically guilty or that heshe should be hung out to dry no matter the situation its just that as someone who is familiar with a lot of these situations and who has read over all the public details available related to this case im pretty surprised by the judges decision for the recordreference and i guess im just clarifying this because i know reddit doesnt have a great track record with womens issues though rnba seems to be a pleasant exception im deeply familiar with all the details of the kobe case too and i personally dont believe he raped or sexually assaulted anyone however in this case im of the opinion that rose did obviously happy to go into more detail on why but this is already getting pretty close to tldr territory

nba,removed,ignore these fucking imbeciles people talk in the abstract about these issues because most of them have no practical experience to draw on have never truly felt threatened have never truly been in danger so they wax poetic and philosophic about what theyd do in a situation or why things are the way they are but push comes to shove and their ass has a gun pulled to their head you better believe they realize the value of the police its easy to hate on abstract but when youre in the concrete its a different story thank you for your service seriously

nba,removed,you cant even come to terms with the fact that im making valid points but instead resort to copy and pasting exactly what i just wrote and idk where yall figure that im a celtics fan but basing my conclusion on how you attempt to prove a point im going to go out on a limb and say ive been watching the raptors since before yall were born and who even says yall in canada omg kys
nba,removed,its the exact same thing just take off your bias glasses for a second lebron left his team because he couldnt win a ring w them he joined a team with championship pedigree that had two other great players the only difference is that your a cavs fan instead of a warriors fan even going back to cle was a non competitive move when you look at the personnel they had ride lebrons dick it should be very clear to you why you feel the way you do youre either a cle fan or a lebron fan so lebrons ring chasing directly benefits your interests kevins ring chasing directly opposed your interests hence your insistence on agreeing with one and disagreeing with the other this is simple shit i shouldnt have to explain to you but since most of you cle fans are ten year olds i dont mind educating you on personal bias your may claim that kevins ring chasing is more egregious but then your argument is basically yeah i was speeding officer but he was speeding way faster so you cant give me a ticket

nba,removed,then what did you mean by that comment if were only talking about scoring ability what do the conference playoffs opponents have to do with it newsflash dipshit were not talking about how good other teams are its about the defense each faced maybe you forgot but even an overall weak playoff team can have great defenders go look at what defenses jordan faced in the playoffs then go watch highlights of those defenses pay attention to how much more physical it was note the alltime great defenders jordan faced also note the hall of fame big men he faced in the playoffs the guys he had to shoot over because he didnt have an outside shot then come tell me durant faced the same level of defenses get the fuck out of here with that bullshit again i keep fucking telling you but youre too stupid i accept your opinion and i agree that durant is one of the greatest pure scorers ever there is no definitive answer to who the greatest pure scorer is because of the drastic changes in eras rules etc i personally think its jordan agree to fucking disagree

nba,removed,i do not watch nba basketball however my friends started a fantasy basketball league last year and implored me to join i crashed my car into a tree while trying to draft from my phone never again so i autodrafted thats where it began my forward was a guy named lebron and he was getting me points nonstop kyle lowry are paul george were two other guys who were good for me i got to draft the first two rounds and they were the guys i picked and soon i was on top of league and lbj thats what id started calling him was one of my top scorers i cant explain why i began to obsess over him maybe its because he kinda looks like me maybe its because i like his commercials a lot but i started watching his highlight tapes and then i started watching his games everytime he dunked i felt like a proud mother i know nothing about the city of cleveland but i watched the whole for documentary about them because i was hoping he would be in it somewhere but he wasnt now im mad at cleveland because he should be part owner and hes not i want lebron to read this i want him to know im his biggest fan even though i dont root for his team and that he should go somewhere that starts him i want him to know that hes one of the best players in the league and he should ask for popstar money i want him to know that i love him i know players come to these subreddits sometimes and answer questions so if lbj ever comes here please forward this to him and if anyone knows how i can contact him just to send him an email i know it will be going to his agent and not him id love to tell him that hes made me a real basketball fan sincerely lebron jamess number one fan
nba,removed,yeah bitch
nba,removed,cant believe lbj is over p
nba,removed,let us not be political here youve stated things that can be seen as inaccurate that leads to an idiotic form of political debate
nba,removed,hes said a lot of dumb stuff but he honestly hasnt said anything that marginalizes groups of people as far as i know and whenever someone tries to show me hes being racist or sexist the source information ends up exonerating him so no while many bigots might support trump many more oppose him too because throwing all his supporters in with the bigots is bigotry itself i fear trump because hes unpredictable and seemingly a little deranged but whats all this were on the right side of history signalling based on accusations of racism and sexism towards trump and his supporters until you back it up this is all just uselessly divisive as if not voting for trump is automatically good people have different reasons and most are wellmeaning wake up the world aint filled with white devils
nba,removed,false lebron aspires to be a billionaire hes got a ways to go still the don is already there and doing more a la running for president its not even close
nba,removed,i wholeheartedly agree couldnt had said it any better
nba,removed,im just comparing apples to apples instead of apples to oranges like the original comment did
nba,removed,is it not a signal that you didnt vote for trump
nba,removed,as a european i needed such a wellresearched article about trump and clinton i think americans needed this too anyway now at least i understand kawhis stats and what the spurs can do to improve their defense great read
nba,removed,find me a trump quote that the media did not use out of context or cut up to make it look worse than it is go find that and then tell me what a bad bad man he is and then tell me how retarded you are for listening to the mainstream media
nba,removed,trumps apgm are high but clintons dick sucked per stats are insane
nba,removed,if blm says you cant be racist towards whites because of privilege then shouldnt that same thinking be applied to asian americans they make the highest yearly salary of all races in the us and also are the most well educated at the end of the day its a harmless joke it wasnt funny but id expect a company owned by a childrens movie and merchandise making company would hire someone with the intellectual humour of a five year old get over it stop the fake outrage
nba,removed,explain
nba,removed,donald trump
nba,removed,those are my thoughts you fucking pompous prick every single thing you list is false and is propagated by the fucking media and you bought it fucking off yourself because you are right and cannot be wrong except you are very fucking wrong
nba,removed,op is a moron im just being subtle
nba,removed,black people cant be racist
nba,removed,did not even mix up l and r
nba,removed,fucking kill yourself kid
nba,removed,for the record i do a lot of respectful talking with conservatives in real life in fact i have stepped it up since the election because frankly the idea of voting for someone like trump is so far from my worldview i cannot help but curious why people came to that decision part of the safety pin is that it is easier for me to do this as a white guy than it would be for a minority because the answer may very well be get rid of the fags spics and niggers very real answer i heard when i asked someone from my hometown that said the vast majority answers are not so flat out racist although the amount that tip toe on the edge are horrifying the reverse must be true in more conservative areas oh it very very very much is everywhere outside of cities in america people always think their area is conservative even places that will vote democrat believe their area is conservative because of the amount of conversation that gets dominated by conservative viewpoints also lebron gave a speech endorsing hillary his vote was not a secret before this whats the point the point is that trumps election made a lot of people with the wrong skin shade very very scared lebron is signalling not only his allegiance but that he shares these concerns him wearing a safety pin does not assume any individual is racist it is an acknowledgment of our racist society wed meet the person first and learn theyre cool then wed find out our political opinions and that humanity we saw through friendship allows for understanding and selfcriticism and a real meeting of the minds the trouble with bigots is that if you fit into one of the groups they hate they tend not to give you the benefit of the doubt and want to hear you out how is the guy with the safety pin the problem again
nba,removed,well thats a terrible argument
nba,removed,my evidence that i dont have to be decent to pieces of shit like them is their very apparent smugness about their opinion they cant be wrong despite being very fucking wrong and they are smug about it what about king fag himself uthecoxer calling me retarded thats what i thought when you refuse to listen to any facts because your feelings are what is right you no longer deserve my respect
nba,removed,fuck you
nba,removed,nah ill link whatever is within the rules brah howd that supporting hillary thing go for you btw dont type anymore
nba,removed,lol enjoy the regular season bro ill give you a few months time till the playoffs hit you wont need any answers from us just watch cavs games
nba,removed,i think youre naive that anyone who voted for trump would have listened to any argument look at the debates clinton actually won all of those and trump voters didnt care hell look at all those scandals he had and people still didnt care dont even try to pass blame that it was the other side america fucked up voting for trump and will pay the price
nba,removed,i feel like trump supporters should actually be beheaded if were going to try and get along with cultures of other worlds something is going to have to be done about these people
nba,removed,the line is at about seems to have nothing to do with lin being asian american
nba,removed,link to the stats that say racists vote for drumpf id like to use it against trumpets

nba,removed,as much as those were great at the time they still held eddie back his two standups were the fucking shit the best part is that whole faggot skit he had during one of em only to get caught with a prostitute tranny later on
nba,removed,they aint playin well but the fact that anyone but curry and kd can be and they still win its kinda dumb draymond played some great defense there tho
nba,removed,enes might enact shariah law in the great state of oklahoma
nba,removed,no there were two separate comments both explaining to me the fact that after games their schedule will be evenly played and i could reference the spurswarriors game thread from last tuesday if i wanted evidence that the fan base is largely dense
nba,removed,the spoiler shit is so annoying to me i have to watch games delayed and they seem to do everything in their power to spoil it for me the ipad app has an option to hide scores but they still show the teams records so you know who won and they show news items about the game which often time give away who won plus you have to start the game live and rewind yourself that is such bullshit they really need to just copy the mlb experience for mlbtv they dont show the results of the games before you pick the game you want to watch they give you the option to start live or the beginning and they even show you a boxscore that is current to wherever you are in the stream it is a really good experience oh and dont get me started on the unskippable ads while watching an archived game god forbid you are second to late when they are going to go to commercial because then you are stuck watching a whole timeouts worth of commercials only to return to the point right when they cut to commercial so you are forced to watch the arena cam for the length of the commercial ag

nba,removed,its more a choke job than a win job you have to admit that
nba,removed,shut the fuck up dude he definitely wouldnt have gone to the finals in the west consistently if the spurs were always a better team than the cavs or miami and they didnt make it times how can you say with a fact that james wouldve taken them to the finals multiple times
nba,removed,wait what are you retarded when have i ever said lebron james wouldnt have won one read the thread i was more than willing to defend him from shitty arguments miami cavs are two year i think lebron could be in the finals
nba,removed,get better at jokes or flair up so i can wish your best player a grievous injury you pussy

nba,removed,theyre games under without much talent or future prospects outside of boogie the kings arent in any position to bring in big name free agents regardless of their cap space and theyve not really shown any type of talent or competence with trades of the draft boogie staying with the kings if he does want to actually contend is dumb theyre not even able to contend for a playoff spot where will they get the talent to simply let them achieve that goal its not like theyre going to flip rudy gays expiring contract at the allstar break for major talent especially with the cap expected to rise further than it had previous been assumed nothing there is talking shit
nba,removed,dont be a fag
nba,removed,if lets say deandre jordan has a wide open three and makes it isnt that luck

nba,removed,there are girly players and manly players feminine people and masculine people men and women are not the same thank the fuck christ for that being pc to the point where saying innocuous shit like they are a girly team is suddenly something we need to be up in arms about and then go say inane nonsense like not a pc thing what the fuck are you on about mate are you fucking high girls should not be expected to compete with men i would hope they find female rolemodels not male ones but if they do they should idolize their personality traits and will to overcome adversity not their physical attributes because they will never match them
nba,removed,ok then the phrase man up should never be used in the media every sitcom movie and commercial begins with the premise that men are dumbsex craved animals that never measure up and this thing gets offended by girly aww how cute

nba,removed,also didnt average shit worth the first years either because he had shaq fucking karl malone rick fox robert horry eddie jones gary payton horace grant etc you literally said kobe didnt score much his first years because malone and payton were on his team you really cant pretend you were talking about when lebron was clearly better in every way than kobe when you specifically said that those two players were part of the reason kobe wasnt scoring during his first years in the league i love that you are trying to call me a retard when you are this remarkably stupid
nba,removed,i love that you continue to refuse to acknowledge the fact that you thought malone and payton were in the lakers in disregarding that if you think players like rick fox robert horry and derek fisher were so good that they were preventing kobe from scoring is laughable why wasnt lebron held back by guys like larry hughes and drew gooden is this your first year watching the nba you probably shouldnt try and make stupid arguments when you clearly know nothing about the topic but please i really want to know how kobes scoring during his first three years was hindered from having karl malone and gary payton on his team
nba,removed,can you guys tell me what you think of my video im talking about will kevin durants rings have less value and respect
nba,removed,donald trump is a better option than crooked hillary

nba,removed,youre a retard you know theres workers who have injuries and through rehab programs theyre able to work again right theyre not working every single day while they rehab and their coworkers and employers dont expect them to especially if that work puts them at further risk for injury hell if youre injured on the job most people get workers comp and dont have to work at all while they get paid do you shit on those people too last season was all about rehab for rose im sorry you have no empathy for other people and cant understand that it wasnt about not wanting to play because he didnt feel like it would you rather the guy sit on the bench with a blown knee while hes getting paid instead because thats what youre asking for at least he was able to play the majority of last season he couldnt say that for any other year of his contract
nba,removed,shut the fuck up tired of these pussy ass pessimistic fans go be a bitch somewhere elss
nba,removed,i dont trust americans to not elect him next term
nba,removed,trump is probably much more retarted than gary or jill just saying they never had a fair shot of media coverage or entering at least one debate and media never gave trump or hilary questions like gary or jill had
nba,removed,mods are fags
nba,removed,im not watching the game or anything i just hope everyone is having a good day ive been reading some on all this trump stuff and its bumming me out enjoy the rest of your weekend
nba,removed,i know i know but at least hes not deranged weve had really bad presidents before anything pence does could be reversed but trump seems like the sort to do lasting damage internationally and at home through his policies
nba,removed,i feel okay about that actually for one thing trump can only replace scalia a conservative for now it will still be a liberalconservativeindependent split which is the composition that got us marriage equality if rbg kennedy or breyer two of the liberals and the independent respectively die then thats going to be a problem also the court which isnt as partisan as the house senate or white house relies on precedent regardless of who set it to overturn marriage equality now they would have to justify a new decision when theres already precedent for allowing it you could probably get some of the guys who ruled against marriage equality the first time around to vote for it to stay because the precedent is already set thats not a guarantee of course just a thought
nba,removed,kobe is relevant to this how fucking dumbass
nba,removed,lol this gets downvotes but fuck the clippers gets bumped to the top guess that says something about trump
nba,removed,he should play trump in a on game
nba,removed,i am convinced teams have been told to play awful on purpose vs gs to make them look unbeatable they did the same thing last year this team in won just games to winning the very next season that is unheard of considering they had the exact same roster gs is good this year but not this good gs last year was avg yet looked like the best team ever
nba,removed,if you are saudi you are welcomed with open arms by trump
nba,removed,this three was so good it blocked trumps muslim ban

nba,removed,im not seems like you are are you
nba,removed,how does signing durant not make them an even bigger success story they set themselves up to be a great fa destination how can you fault them for that if anything durant has hurt his legacy for joking gs but not the other way around
nba,removed,are you trolling or retarded do you not understand that the warriors system isnt conducive to assists for a single person because of the ball movement im saying if you put curry on the tickets he would average as many assists as harden theyre comparable passers he was putting up per game back on the iso heavy mark jackson warriors and hes a better passer now

nba,removed,cool story bro the nba rigged game giving lebitch a championship because your shitty ass city has zero income without the lebronomy leaveland indians blew a in and you shitty fans deserve the year drought that will be following your gloating ways but in the end with no sports the bottom line is you live in the mistake by the lake and i live in california i just blew my load all over your face everytime you post anything about the warriors remember one thing were in the golden state youre in the butthole of the us
nba,removed,is thon maker grandfathered in for trumps muslim ban
nba,removed,harry potter squad dont fuck around
nba,removed,oh stfu the fact that curry didnt get a finals mvp is a testament that he didnt play to his usual standard you do realize that it was unprecedented for a regular season mvp and title winner to not get the finals mvp right they just gave iggy fmvp for holding lebron to lmao that says it all that curry underperformed
nba,removed,this probably all stems from a leak that rondo actually voted for trump
nba,removed,they kill all the native americans and he has the audacity to call out immigrants when hes one himself smh white people
nba,removed,youre right dont be put off by the lebitch dickriders
nba,removed,eh not really he couldnt explain to his kids why trump won but never really mentioned how hed have to explain hillary breaking the law

nba,removed,hopefully giant douche orange turd sandwitch comes to senses and changes some of his policies the solution is not to comply to laws of hate but to oppose them
nba,removed,hopefully trump is impeached before he can do even more damage how anyone can support this fascist blows my mind
nba,removed,as a basketball fan trump is a literal garbage
nba,removed,after currys performance last night westbrick comes out today and puts up and counting hahaha this dude is beyond overrated and not good people think he is amazing cuz of his overrated triple doubles and he plays hard also what is up with korver the same thing allen went thru on miami with lbj do they get paid to miss on purpose they should be shooting well over from considering they are always wide open yet they dont
nba,removed,i hope trump gets impeached what a shitshow
nba,removed,ohio voted trump though were in a young liberal bubble here on reddit where even most texans on reddit are likely to be leftleaning
nba,removed,yes in response to trumps executive order iran doesnt issue this ban if trump doesnt issue his
nba,removed,yea our fanbass suck because we want melo to pass the ball more what a bunch of douchebags
nba,removed,no these guys are barred from iran because they banned american nationals in response to trump banning iranian nationals
nba,removed,this specific story is due to iran banning americans from travelling there as retaliation for trumps eo since the players are american they cant go to iran to play ball
nba,removed,is it really discussion if its completely onesided rnba is almost completely leftist trump is a headass is brilliant discussion by the way
nba,removed,are you stupid no nba fanbase supports their team like knicks fans do
nba,removed,its not impossible lets say canada talks shit on trump and trump does some dumb shit and we become enemies with canada no more raptors
nba,removed,haha yeah the og card is but they photshopped
nba,removed,of course im being downvoted because anything not bashing trump is hated on reddit i have been a lifelong liberal but liberals are destroying themselves w their actions and the way theyve acted the past few years sadly they dont realize this and it will ultimately lead to trump being reelected
nba,removed,one time i shoved a hot dog up my ass didnt expect more from you

nba,removed,i am a short person not extremely well built but sometimes other larger men seem to get a hard on when i am close to them sometimes i wonder if it is something i say or do maybe my actions when talking with them suggest something else entirely the following is an example of what happened last week when i visited a friend in florida and went to a football game with him we did the normal stuff hotdogs beer standing and shouting as our team did something good the place was packed and there was a guy directly behind me big and burley and loud he seemed to bump into me every time he stood up and once he stood and i felt something push against me that i knew was his cock i just shrugged it off thinking it was accidental but then it happened again and he rubbed it slower this time the head almost in the crack of my ass this was a huge turn on for me and i pushed back slightly to let him know i knew what was going on my friend glanced back and smiled at the guy and said hi frank hows it going frank spoke back and said who is your friend here i was introduced as i turned around to shake his hand i saw the bulge in his pants and he said good to meet you jeremy hope we can get together in a little while and finish our discussion i got the discussion bit ok and said it will be a pleasure and he smiled my friend and i walked back to the parking lot and i found myself looking around to see if i could spot frank as my fantasy was working overtime just imagining what it would feel like jason asked me what i thought of frank i said he seemed ok and jason told me to watch myself because frank likes men and boys we found jasons car and i saw frank with a couple of other men a few cars away frank had a van and had the side doors open and the other two men got inside jason said hey lets go get a beer by the way i have a date in an hour do you think you will be ok for a couple of hours i told him i would be just fine and we proceeded to the pub once we were inside and ordered our beers jason excused himself and walked over to this beautiful redhead and sat with her someone walked up behind me and put his hand on my shoulder and said hi jeremy looks like you have been deserted ok if we sit down here with you fine i replied we drank a beer and all this time frank was touching me in some way or other and the other two guys were laughing and joking and patting me on the back or on the knee finally frank leaned over and whispered in my ear lets go out in my van and finish this beer and have some fun by this time my imagination was really running wild and i had fantasized doing things with all three of them we got to the van and the two men got inside but frank pulled me away to the back of the van where we could not be seen and put his arms around me and said i think you want a cock inside that little ass of yours you have been fidgeting around like a little virgin girl since we have been with you with this he put his hand between my legs and sure enough i had a hard on he took my hand and placed it on his very stiff huge cock and told me to suck it i bent down and put it down my throat to the hilt and starting sucking him and in a couple of minutes had a mouthful of cum he bucked like he really enjoyed it we got into the van and frank told me to blow the other two they helped me get my pants off and i got on my hands and knees and started sucking the one guy when i felt a finger at my ass hole frank had spred some slippery stuff inside me and then proceeded to get the head of his cock inside me it hurt but i pushed back on his shaft and he managed to get the head in and then rammed it a couple of inches further eventually the hurt began to go away and pleasure took its place when he went in to the hilt and started fucking me after minutes or so frank shot a wad inside me that warmed my entire body he pulled out and immediately this other guy shoved his cock inside and started pumping my ass too
nba,removed,first i never said anything about carters mostly because i was not alive at the time however if you look into the matter carter specifically targeted iranian citizens with active us visas during a time in which us citizens were being held captive abroad his actions were for security reasons based on a specific nationality not a religion the difference is that iranians were citizens of and owed allegiance to a country that was acting against the united states the class of all muslims has no similar connection to isis or terrorists that makes the analogy seriously flawed further he did not say he wanted to carefully screen muslims entering the country but rather something much more drastic carters actions were in response to a country that not only accepted but defended the kidnapping of us citizens totally different cases in regards to his comments on hispanic immigrants he is showing racism towards mexicans whether you want to accept it or not he did not say some of the illegal immigrants are committing crime he said this which makes it sound as though there is some statistic showing that of rapists are mexican i never said illegally entering the country is ok but painting with such broad strokes does display racist remarks and tendencies on the matter of the kkk its that he lied out front and had to be hounded before he would finally disavow the mans statements its eerily similar to the baylor president having to talk to his lawyer after admitting that he may have actually seen the email from the woman claiming she was sexually harassed when you arent racist and have heard of the kkk leader in question you immediately refuse his support that one isnt hard to figure out his statements toward women totally come off sexist in in an interview with esquire he stated in regards to women in the media you know it doesnt really matter what write as long as youve got a young and beautiful piece of ass in he published trump the art of the comeback in which he claimed all women are goldiggers in he pitched a show called lady or a tramp which thankfully never made it off the ground this is from a interview with carrie prejean who had competed in miss usa which trump is a coowner he had the girls parade in front of him so he could separate those he found attractive from those he didnt many of the girls found this exercise humiliating some of the girls were sobbing backstage after left devastated to have failed even before the competition really began it was as though we had been stripped bare in reports surfaced that he would have the men on his tv show rate the women who were also competing in he tweeted unreported sexual assults in the militaryonly convictions what did these geniuses expect when they put men women together as if sexual assaults are a natural product of cohabitation talking about carly fiorina can you imagine that the face of our next next president i mean shes a woman and im not supposed to say bad things but really folks come on are we serious meaning that women can not be president also he was the one that decided women could run businesses were there literally no other instances of women in leadership roles before theres countless other examples of all of my accusations but because ive already written a damn novel im going to cut it short there i should also say that im not particularly a huge hillary fan either and that this election is going to be aggravating because im going to hate whoever wins

nba,removed,the game thread over on rwarriors is a freaking goldmine this game a genuine quote from a fan alright listen up this is now the plan we walk off in protest knowing this game is over with scott foster the ref biases focusing on making sure the warriors style of play doesnt succeed we refuse to show up until league officially redacts draymonds suspension with a gameimpacting compensation ie erase the game or replay the game with lebron suspension as well or no suspensions if they say yes then great otherwise doesnt play cavs might get ship due to forfeit but with a fat asterisk league eventually disbands when warriors fo starts a new league that is better run holds refs accountable and delivers a more entertaining product lebron is banned and he spends the days sitting alone in his house in cleveland holding onto a now defunct championship trophy that no one remembers other than it coming from the league that dishonorably disbanded due to his crybaby influence since a new nba season never starts cleveland is never given the championship and the curse officially continues lebron stares off into the void miserable for all eternity knowing how close he was but how he couldnt get there because he couldnt overcome being a bitch the salt is just too much

nba,removed,no i dont care about the last word and i have no problem with changing my opinion when presented with strong arguments so maybe you should calm your stupid ass down and stop assuming dumb shit you pretty much keep saying the same thing over and over in all of these comments and ranting about how youre an expert on the situation or some shit even though were just talking about one tweet i was just kind of debriefed on what the security thought happened with some guy that poses with fake credentials and gets backstage at a lot of events the nba finals and all that stuff curry tells espncom they kind of profiled my fatherinlaw and thought he was him they threatened to arrest him before they checked out his credentials its kind of been an emotional and tough night all the way around it sounds like the definition of racial profiling
nba,removed,thats what blacks do

nba,removed,dwill was a great passer i havent watched him much the last few years so i am not wise on how his physical unravelling has effected his passing oh no you could explain how dwill isnt as good as he once was instead of this useless comment how the fuck is it trolling to think critically about the game rather than get caught up in the ohmygodlebronwonagamebesteverrrrrrrrrrr schtick this sub rolls around in every single game seriously add to the discussion or fuck off
nba,removed,no real issues do you know who ugearydigit is hes a gay morbidly obese furry with a transgender sister or brother geary wasnt clear on where they ended up hes one of those users who brigades from srs comments on every srs linked comment but one day wont because he stuck a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger wih his toes and the sad part is were the people who are going to notice since hes stated that he has no friends irl and is estranged from his family save for his sister or brother again it was unclear

nba,removed,flair aside is anything i said incorrect okc is well known to be the worst city in the nba udoh is so bad he couldnt stay in the league years
nba,removed,quit being a little bitch
nba,removed,my sources are common knowledge what redeeming factor does oklahoma city have nothing every nba small market has a benefit utah has natural beauty milwaukee is close to chicago memphis and new orleans have rich history portland has natural beauty nike and the hip factor closest comparison is indianapolis but the fact that they have had a rich sports history and nba fans who have endured what its really like to be an nba fan the combination of a terrible city uneducated and untested fans and a lying owner and organization make okc the undeniablely worst city with an nba team
nba,removed,shutup fag boi
nba,removed,why not cut your dick off you emaciated beta
nba,removed,trying to make up for his fag boi mentality
nba,removed,quality retort i am sorry you were not raised more open minded and cant handle others opinions on issues you are going to have a rough adult hood when you realize you are in fact not a special little flower like your mother and all your liberal teachersprofessors have tried to tell you i suggest you open your eyes listen to others you might not always agree with them but you will atleast learn something being close minded ignorance closemindedness by bigots is what got us to the situation we are in today dont be like them
nba,removed,this isnt about city rivalry this is just state gov fucking over everyone in the usual fashion a raleigh guy

nba,removed,im not some lgbt advocate or anything but if he doesnt see the basic violation of human rights here he is honestly retarded
nba,removed,this is a bunch of fuckery can we just get rid of transgender in general fuck kinda shit is that
nba,removed,
nba,removed,just wanted to say that from personal experience i know that deep depression can feel like youre trying to chip through a giant stone wall and the only tool you were given for the task is a half used roll of toothpaste everything during these moments feels useless and meaningless but i also know that if you keep chipping away and making tinyminuscule improvements when you have the power to you will eventually make it through i like the rnozerodays sub for their similar views on it
nba,removed,i prefer dickriders
nba,removed,gender identity disorder is a mental illness
nba,removed,you had good points until you brought up blacks fuck you cunt
nba,removed,i dont see why the nba has to take that economic boost away from charlotte what basically is going on is the nba is trying to use this as a positive marketing ploy at charlottes expense anyone that has anything to do with charlotte has the right to be pissed off they are getting millions taken away because some people in the state share a different viewpoint that is absurd i honestly think the nba should be embarrassed because ultimately the message is of intolerance
nba,removed,i agree with his statement i dont wanna use the same bathroom as a tranny
nba,removed,shut up fag boi i only went to college for one year and didnt pay attention in class lol
nba,removed,he would take that team deep into the playoffs
nba,removed,wwwredditcomrthedonald
nba,removed,probably because he had half the number of white blood cells that a normal person has oh wait is the lakers roast later today and not now goteem imhilarious
nba,removed,fucking s
nba,removed,ya hes a human turd for expressing his opinion an opinion that many people share perhaps you are the close minded turd
nba,removed,sometimes downvotes are just because youre fucking stupid occams razor friend
nba,removed,are you calling us fucking stupid for not agreeing with you because thats what it sounds like youre saying
nba,removed,i beat a woman in an argument before and after that i proved her wrong too
nba,removed,too bad what their standing up for is a false narrative absolutely no stats prove it true sorry but facts win over feelings no matter how systemic you think an issue is you gotta have the facts to prove it and they dont things that dont explain high black crime poverty low selfesteem data says blks have high parentingenvironment sad but true its second to another factor things that do explain high black crime genetics ultimately race iq blacks arent dumb per say but their iq contributes to impulsivity hence crime
nba,removed,in most instances white pride has been antinon white so yeah in this aspect it is go back torthedonald you dumb bitch
nba,removed,he has a lot of wierd tweets from a few years ago one of my favs was him calling some guy a fag and saying he wasnt snart cause he only had one year of college wierd

nba,removed,lbj is such a fraud and liar he said he would love to play with melo and wade wade chooses chicago over cleveland lbj prolly said no to the melo trade and you arent going to trade irving for a inured so that makes sense i hope the cavs continue to lose and love plays bad so that trade happens kevin love for melo is a rip off to the knicks who the hell would say no to that cleveland has to be the only team in the league to say no to that all these media members know cleveland would be much better than you got the dumb fans who disagree nba fans are the sheep who still believe the nba is a legit sport lets be real gs should win it all with ease this year cleveland is a avg team at best i have no clue what cavs fans love obsession is love is the most useless player ever i guess cavs fans enjoy watching love brick every wide open he gets and get abused by whoever he is guarding
nba,removed,ive been arguing for a long time that trump is no more of a businessman than kim k when he actually tries to run a business hes not real successful what he does make a lot of money from is licensing his valuable brand and entertaining people kardashians made a lot of money from their appgame store credit card etc idk what else they do so if you think donald trumps business experience makes him qualified you may as well vote for a kardashian
nba,removed,he is part of the sample of some warriors fans just admit you can be delusional and kindly gtfo
nba,removed,both have won nothing and westbrook will be superior in the stats btw westbrook has actually made the finals but since were talking about i shouldnt even say that at least westbrook has made the wcf multiple times only a better passer westbrook a better scorer arguable but likely a better rebounder better at blocking shots
nba,removed,dangelo russell literally sucks ass

nba,removed,normally id back kevin on something like this but hes taking it overboard like its just a dumb meme its not like people are shitting on him ahahaha he loves his mother what a fag or anything
nba,removed,hahahaha you only have a positive number because you live and breath reddit if you had anything less than what you have it would honestly be impressive considering you spend so much of your free time one here you might as well be a moderator with how frequently you comment on game threads i guess community college provides you a lot of free time on your hands still though just by taking a short gander down your comment history there are almost more negative comments than positive pretty sad that the subreddit you love the most hate you the most and that plenty of people call you out on the bandwagoner that you are hows living with mom and dad have they expressed how disappointed they are in you yet
nba,removed,i heard he whispered op is a faggot
nba,removed,umm it was part of my argument dip shit
nba,removed,mlb uses additional umpires for playoff games no reason nba cant put another ref or two on the floor

nba,removed,i hope not
nba,removed,when the acid hits
nba,removed,are warriors fans really so dumb adhom right off the bat mkay like cleveland ohio is a great concentration of intelligence d that they believe this is some sort of conspiracy against draymond no i believe hes a little worse than most players for this had a couple of disproportionately bad incidents last year and now everyone notices every time whether its kicking for angular momentum to adjust for being pushed in air or to draw the foul at the same time i think hes not the only one and that swinging your legs to control the rotation and balance of the rest of your body is something that makes a lot of sense to do in many circumstances

nba,removed,i saw james harden at a grocery store in houston yesterday i told him how cool it was to meet him in person but i didnt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything he said oh like youre doing now i was taken aback and all i could say was huh but he kept cutting me off and going huh huh huh and extending his arms in front of me i think he was trying to draw a foul or something i walked away and continued with my shopping and i heard him chuckle as i walked off when i came to pay for my stuff up front i saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen milky ways in his hands without paying the girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like sir you need to pay for those first at first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter when she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually to prevent any electrical infetterence and then turned around and winked at me i dont even think thats a word after she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly

nba,removed,httpgrantlandcomthetrianglenbacontractextensionsklaythompsonwarriorsjazzspurs im inclined to believe zach lowe and he said that klay didnt get the max it seems like the max because he got a true max his first year based off of that years cap but for the rest of the years it was just straight money and not a percentage of the cap so with the cap rising he wasnt getting an increase in salary
nba,removed,a lot of great people die young yet people like kanye west get to live

nba,removed,as an okc fan thinking about durant going to gsw doesnt make me sick sad or mad it would literally make me feel disappointed knowing that a player i have admired since the first time i started watching basketball could make such a decision gets me really disappointed how can durant dare to join a team that holds the nba regular season record for most wins how can he join a team that only went to the nba finals because him and westbrook decided to play hero ball and turned the ball over times in the last minutes of he game oh and durant went the whole game how can he join a team that can win and already won an nba title without him i love durant but if he joins the warriors although he is one of the taller players in the league he would be the smallest player in the nba in my eyes anyone but gsw durant they are arrogant and cocky which is everything i believe you not to be

nba,removed,hmm you could argue durant is the tyrells cavs are the lannisters and daenarys is the warriors by all arguments dany should probably be in charge but her house has fallen on tough time as of late dominated by an inferior foe with an inferior leader cersei and the lannisters seeing the tides turning the tyrells durant have united with dany as its the only logical move the bountiful summer harvests are drawing to an end harden left the honeymooon is over winter is coming soon would westbrook definitely not do the same back to durant given the chance and many new battles to be fought they just want to be on the obvious winning side its the pragmatic move of someone making a difficult decision but the appropriate one given the circumstances
nba,removed,wanna compare dick sizes faggot

nba,removed,how much of lebrons dick could he fit into ops asshole if he tried just asking because he usually lets the dickriders come on him he doesnt force it on them or try to rip assholes away from guys like op if op wanted i bet hed average his whole dick in there imo

nba,removed,his legacy was cemented before this the average fan thinks hes a shitter who will never amount to jordan because lebum lul sad truth lebron still may end up the goat in the eyes of those educated on the game but he will never be the goat to of basketball watchers aka the casual fan

nba,removed,wait i cant exactly read your tone because this is a text post but are you trying to imply that its ridiculous to be flamed as a gay hater for using the word faggot
nba,removed,where you can no longer say faggot without getting flamed as a gay hater um
nba,removed,you know yellow journalism and half truths didnt start with the invention of twitter muckraking and quoting people out of context has been around since the printing press was invented this narrative that blames twitter and the clickbait generation for bad journalism is lazy journalists as well as espn need to take the blame for this not the platform they use
nba,removed,you need to calm down nowhere did i mention that it didnt mean less of a slur when used it to insult or demean homosexuals that has nothing to do with my point if thats not what you were implying youre just posting something thats irrelevant which isnt anything new i just said it has multiple meanings and people need to learn them before throwing things out of context people used to say the word faggot to call someone stupid or a strong negative connotation in you cant even call someone a faggot to imply stupid without being flamed by someone going o u said faggot omg u hate gay people
nba,removed,boston has the whole trade gravitational pull bro

nba,removed,point proven soft like charmin dont worry youll start developing a tan when you actually face adversity and rise above it
nba,removed,kids are shot over basketball shoes each year disposable income goes towards frivolous items like these shoes over necessary goods or goods to get out of poverty these guys get contracts for these shoes and then preach in their ivory towers on how its unfair people dying in the fucking streets families concerned over feeding their family and paying rent and these guys talk down on us for this shit maybe why million more black people voted for trump than they did for romney

nba,removed,lbj had worse stats yet a higher per than harden harden averaged ftas per game this guy cant score unless on the ft line people say lbj cant shoot well neither can harden what the hell is up with the harden circle jerk i would take a past prime wade over harden right now people say howard is a team cancer well harden is a team cancer put lbj on that rockets take instead of harden and hou would make the finals put harden on this cavs team instead of lbj and they would have prolly already been eliminated in that weak east harden has decent stats but he plays no defense and makes no difference on the game lbj with a bunch of bench warmers won more games vs gs than harden did last year
nba,removed,fuck this gay earth
nba,removed,this is fucking cringe to be honest
nba,removed,would have to agree with that harden shouldve made at least all nba albeit his lack of defensive prowess

nba,removed,i find it hilarious that rnba hate circlejerks over a blue collar guy like dray but then defends a guy like durant who chokes harder than the white chicks with black dicks pornos along with bending over and spreading their cheeks for a metrosexual like westbrook i guess thats the liberal landscape now a days

nba,removed,so lets see i see jabari parker kobe bryant paul george jose calderon john wall westbrook lillard odom curry i could go on i expected to just see white people judging by your insinuation yeah theres nash dirk hayward in there but why is that a problem are they not genuinely likeable people
nba,removed,you guys are retarded all you look at is the number of free throws taken by each team and if it exceeds the team youre rooting for then clearly the refs are fixing the game im just saying that the game wasnt reffed well warriors got fouls that should have been no calls if a team deserves a foul then i dont care if its free throws to as long as its reffed consistently
nba,removed,i hope the person you love the most doesnt come home again
nba,removed,thunder will finish it off at home in game
nba,removed,man refs gave us that game lol
nba,removed,its a good question i would go with dirk even though he doesnt have as many titles as dwade although he has been carrying a heavier work load the whole team throughout his career and played in a tougher conference alas dirk also has been in all nba vs wade who has been in only and hasnt been selected in while plus you know mvp for dirk check out this great comparison of both careers here at httpwwwmorethanjustsportscomcomparinggreatness
nba,removed,refs gifted you games its just that simple the fact that you came back to comment on this shows what a pathetic cunt of a fan base okc has doesnt suprise me your stars are hipsterthugs fuckin loser cunts

nba,removed,at echo project i watched a wookette giving birth during the gza set i was just peaking on some people were trying to get medical help but they hadnt arrived some other wookette claimed to be a midwife and was coaching the woman through this her wook man is standing there shirtless and spun like top just making these weird sounds while he is crushing his beer can and spraying coors light all over everyone he looked really anxious about the whole thing grabbing his face and just making grunts and stuff the babys head starts to crown and the medics still havent arrived this is where it gets crazy it was so fucking dusty out there and the baby and all the surrounding fluids were immediately muddified by the blowing dirt i mean its fucking gross all of a sudden this fucking kid probably or in his oversized neon flatbrim lrg hat runs up yelling welcome to the party bitch before he blows a huge plume of smoke right in the babys face while the umbilical cord is still attached and shit the smell was unmistakeable this baby had just been deemsterd he must have pulled the hit from a bong bc it was monstrous the surrounding crowd dropped their jaws and someone tackled the kid as he starts to run away he didnt make it more than and the he was probably blasting off about now the mom is clutching the dirty baby and trying to calm it though strangely the baby was not crying tripping balls i guess and while the dude is getting screamed at the dad suddenly pounces into action he jumps on the dude and starts smashing said bisco kids face with the crushed up beer can of which he seemingly just cant let go the bisco kid is kicking and trying to roll out of it and the wookdad grabs the kids hair w one hand he finally let the can go and shoves his other hand half way inside the guys mouth he is pulling his mouth open and rips his cheek open repeat rips his fucking cheek open there is blood everywhere and the dude lets out this braveheartlike scream as he gets pulled off by the folks around him blood all over bisco kids face shirt and formerly fresh flat breezy the copsmedics arrived about that time and took over the situation shit was crazy as hell

nba,removed,the west is way overrated people get a hardon ever a meaningless regular season record which means nothing the west this season and last season and the season before consisted of the same good teams gs and sa and the league is not going to have sa make the finals so gs is winning the west by default the league hates the clippers so you can eliminate them and the rockets are a trick pony also people didnt start saying the east sucks until lbj joined miami or was it skip bayless that started it since he has a ton of clueless d riders since more teams in the east made the finals than the west from sa or la made the finals times out of seasons that is absurd and should not be happening if the west is dominate
nba,removed,remindme months

nba,removed,when looking at westbrooks impact on the team defense it is hard to suggest that westbrook is a bad defender the numbers that posted here are not particularly useful in evaluating a players defensive value as they do not reflect a players impact on team defense which is the ultimate aim of individual defense i assume that the op did not bring up westbrooks onoff numbers or drpm because they strongly counter the idea that westbrook has a negative impact on okcs team defense okc performs significantly better on defense with westbrook in the game per statsnbacom with westbrook on the court okc has a def rtg of memphis is in the league with a def rtg of with russ off the court okc has a def rtg of which is identical to the ranked brooklyn nets def rtg if westbrook was such a massive defensive liability okc would be unable play at such a high level defensively with him on the court besides onoff stats westbrook also rates well defensively by adjusted models like rpm westbrook rates in drpm among point guards with a drpm this rates well compared to other allstar level point guards as the below chart demonstrates likely all star pgsdrpm simply put if westbrook was such a bad defender it would present itself in his teams defensive performance thus westbrook is not an awful or even bad defender he is merely an average one though you could more successfully argue he is an above average defender than an awful one lastly regarding your claim that westbrook stat pads for rebounds the numbers suggest that regardless of whether or not russs rebounding totals are inflated russs overall gaudy numbers translate in terms of team impact if you are attempting to discredit westbrook by suggesting that his box score stats or triple double average serve as the sole argument for his excellence you are doing westbrook a disservice westbrook rates as elite by essentially all allinone advanced stats not just ones that are solely dependent on box score numbers stats that aim to account for a players impact on team performance rate him as elite per basketball reference westbrook has an onoff net rating of per possessions also he boasts a leagueleading vorp of and is in the league in rpm at for comparison the mvp favorite james harden has a net rating per possessions is in the league in vorp and in regardless of whether one approves of russs playstyle he clearly has a massively positive impact on okc and is amongst the best players in the league

nba,removed,ive been thinking about why the loss to the cavs felt so personal not just like a loss to a great team in an epic match up and thats because it wasnt that what we witnessed was the warriors psychological crumbling to a lesserskilled team a team that represents the old guard of the nba and taunts us in a bullylike way with their winatanycost style thats why it hurts to me and other bay area fans who have come to embrace the team basketballstyle the warriors play which is based around unselfish play lots of passing and assists and the joy of the game we want to see that new style of play winning on the court and largely it does win in fact last season it won more games than any team in nba history unfortunately we dont value the way warriors have changed the nba anywhere near as much as the blackandwhite idea of winning we allow all the records the warriors broke last year and the historic greatness of that team to be invalidated by the idea that winning is the only thing that matters im not here to argue a theory that winning isnt everything thats way too ingrained in american society and capitalism to be worth the strokes of my keyboard but what i will say is that the old ruthless hypermasculine style of play is sometimes a poison to the new teambased joycentered style of play the cavs and the warriors are less in a rivalry than they are in a struggle between two modes of being when the cavs use every tool at their disposal to win many of which are not in the realm of basketball skills eg refs calling in their favor lebron using his nba political capital to get draymond suspended we dont look at the complexity of their championship win we just decide not to look like pussies and accept that they beat us but there is more to the story and it doesnt change the fact that they beat us but it adds some color to the picture of why it happened and why its still happening my take is that yes they beat us fair and square to become the champions last year they did not do so by being better at basketball but rather by maintaining a psychological edge over us which they still maintain today their psychological edge mostly comes down to the fact that our system is based on positivity sharing and having fun and their system is based on a brutal drive to win at any cost which acts like a poison to us now obviously its not quite that simple – they have adopted some of our frequentpassing and point shooting system which we adapted from the spurs anyway and we sometimes do what we can to win at any cost as well but the essences of both teams are still as i described and that psychs us out the biggest effect of all is on curry who is the ultimate example of a joybased player and because of that he lets the cavs ruthlessness get into his head more than anyone and when the cavs take curry out of the game psychologically the matchup gets a lot closer tldr cavs dont have our skills but maintain a psychological edge by being ruthless in the face of our unselfish joycentered way of playing which takes the teams heads especially currys out of the game and allows the cavs to maintain a small advantage

nba,removed,im very impressed hes got instinct and mentality obvious athleticism
nba,removed,no adam silver knew this was lebrons last chance to win a ring so he intervened like a bitch and suspended draymond cause lebron was soft about being called a bitch warriors win that series easy
nba,removed,that dude is a piece of garbage dont waste your time on him he used to wear spurs flair a few seasons ago and talk mad trash then he switched to gsw and now i guess hes flavorless

nba,removed,this new website is literally the worst i takes forever to load things and hits just hard to navigate in general
nba,removed,i know more than you and i know that the charge was added to the game to aid unathletic highschoolers when they played the very athletic inner city schools
nba,removed,its weak shit that bad defenders use as a crutch standing still an letting someone run into you is bullshit defense that the league refuses to take out of the rule book because they dont want to alienate white highschool coaches
nba,removed,dont worry plenty of people can already assess with high confidence how low your intelligence and self esteem is by how incoherent you are you cant even explain in one post what you mean by op has an agenda just because op has a fresh new account and has only posted about this trial doesnt mean hes not a basketball fan dont assume things because you come off as two things stupid and an asshole quit being a stupid asshole

nba,removed,lemme lay down the truth mlk didnt end racism neither did obama or bruce lee racial prejudice still permeates all aspects of our lives and one of the most obvious impacts is with beauty standards and sexual racial preferences and no racial preferences arent the same as sexual orientation most people would agree by now that homosexuality is innate in contrast racial preferences are highly dependent on our environment just ask anybody whos moved abroad and suddenly found themselves becoming open to new races of menwomen that they never considered before anyway the fundamental racial model in the west goes like this blacks are abnormally masculine asians are abnormally feminine whites are in the ideal middle these stereotypes affect our lives in many ways including our sexual preferences it is no coincidence that when interracial relationships with whites and minorities happen its usually with black men and asian women these groups conform to a sort of exotic appeal outside of the white standard consequently asian men and black women are left behind even worse a lot of black men and asian women find the allure of white acceptance so appealing that they ignore or badmouth the menwomen of their own racial community to further ingratiate themselves into mainstream society this kind of shit really tears minority communities apart on one hand you cant control other peoples personal lives on the other you also cant just tolerate it when people of your own community are engaging in internalized racism racism is bad enough but its particularly infuriating and devastating when it comes from within your own community
nba,removed,the jazz announcers are straightup cock suckers they gargle jizz in the morning

nba,removed,locker room talk anyone grabbed any good pussies lately
nba,removed,im sure there are plenty of cross burning white hooded racists that are more ignorant than me out in good ole oklahoma how many of your neighbors are racist trump supporters
nba,removed,the only thing i dont like about rnba is the amount of bandwagoners and fake fans for example the amount of miami heat fans who post in this sub have gone way down since the big era also the amount of former bulls fans who became knicks fans over night because rose was traded is staggering as well aka the amount of fake fans who call themselves fans is quite shameful thats why individual team subreddits are better for discussing with real fans of a team otherwise its a great community to talk to nba fans from different parts of the world and who have different perspectives on the game of basketball
nba,removed,where were you when the malice at the palace happened it was a perfect storm of events but stern being a lawyer he took every part of the storm to punish punish anything that can heat up a rivalry on court

nba,removed,in his defense the op is the one who came up with the gay title
nba,removed,do you think it just crusts over his orifice since he passes out right after they both finish or does he get up and wash himself i mean if you think about it for a second it would be fun to peel it off the morning after kinda like peeling off dried glue if it has the right texture to it honestly curry probably has a top notch diet so im betting those loads are extra viscous and pasty btw anybody got any krispy kreme coupons they wanna share

nba,removed,like the white dude from atlanta last week
nba,removed,can we talk about how crappy the way some of you act is some of you are aware of the mavs fans who have followed me around u pinging bringing up random unrelated past arguments pulling passive aggressive bullcrap and at its peak vote manipulating and posting my personal information including my picture and first name but now nonmavs fans are doing it too here brings up here ujakaloaf brings it up here uyupthup blatantly i put out heres of the season i was more complimentary of the bucks than the bucks fans themselves and thats not to mention the chain from yesterdays free talklocker room thread all of you should be ashamed of yourself and as a community we have to do better

nba,removed,how do you hillbillies keep finding internet
nba,removed,yeah its maybe disrespectful but still i think thats little selfish i mean is still huge amount of money and then heat couldve had better chances with whiteside and kd he also gets money from endorsements as well would easily still make in year just imagine if whole team would think like whats really best for my team to succeed so lets say the starting would all get contracts and theres still left for the bench

nba,removed,i just proved that rondo knew kennedy was gay because kennedys sexuality was at the center of a feud between him and rondos coach i dont know whether doc knew or not at the time but it became an open secret in the league after that incident so rondo knew exactly what he was doing when he decided to call bill kennedy a fucking faggot multiple times
nba,removed,he should never be forgiven for calling a gay man a faggot i dont agree with it but up until years ago alot of people called gay men faggots all the time
nba,removed,if hes seriously considering the mavs then he needs other leverage
nba,removed,euroleague offers a premium streaming service euroleague tv all games in hd and they remain archived for later viewing pretty good overall that said its a month and only really worth it if youre pretty into the league fiba is currently streaming the tournament on youtube and streams other tourney content in general its always worth digging around for games on youtube rojadirectaeu is a torrent site that is a hub for all sorts of different sports including international basketball
nba,removed,youre dumb as fuck if you think goodell deserves any credit for the increase in the nfls popularity and revenue classic case of confusing causation with correlation also spending millions of dollars on a witchhunt filled with lies corrupt investigations in attempt to screw over one of the greatest players to every play in the league over some basic science that explains a little bit of air in a football is just a joke not to mention what he did to the saints over bountygate
nba,removed,yes
nba,removed,i speak straight facts pleighboi why do you think leped dropped out of the olympics this year probably because he reupped too close to the antidoping schedule i dont trust the nba at all when it comes to these things ever since they banned donald sterling its been a mess i guarantee they test clean hardworking players like dellavedova and mozgov and pass it on as lehghs tests somehow that con artist managed to take a whole franchise hostage but its amusing that it happens to dan gilbert when his success is pretty much based on taking other peoples finances hostage
nba,removed,no theyre fucking not idiot
nba,removed,classy and intelligent no surprise thats how the only asian guy in the nba acts
nba,removed,ive been a fan for years so fuck off i watched the team back in the j kidd and vc days yeah i watched the team as well when we went i hate people that claim to know shit about a person without knowing them okay maybe i am too harsh on lin and ibapologize for that but dont question my loyalty to my team im just thinking what i think is best for the team and doninhave to agree with anything that is popular im cool with lin so stop thinking i wont jump outbid my nets team like that and be a dick like that i watched this team for years and yeah i know how it feels to suck and be mediocre people have opinions and i just said what i felt was right and yeah maybe i was wrong but injust said what i felt what was best for the team i fucking hate people that say shit about a person without even knowing them same with people calling most osw fans bandwagoners ok i might have judged lin as well but didnt say like he sucked cause i know he is solid and i even said he was improvement from last year
nba,removed,lmao u know
nba,removed,yo you obviously dont even know where that word comes from if youre still willing to call someone its direct meaning evil people like homosexuals and witches used to be burned at the stake on top of faggots bundles of sticks so the term was born out of someone like this being called just another faggot for the fire so yes calling someone gay with a negative connotation is an immature stupid asshole thing to say and i dont condone it but your comment was almost equally shitty and for the same reason rondos was its not about the word its about the meaning and you invoked the exact same fucking meaning with the exact same negative history which youre obviously unaware of dont criticize other people when you seem to be just as liable to say dumb shit yourself
nba,removed,if so id like him to stop using the word faggot before his induction
nba,removed,hort the door hort the door

nba,removed,turns out that the warriors arent small on avg whouda guessed
nba,removed,you should stop hiding behind a knicks flair and embrace being a bandwagon warriors fan
nba,removed,im not comfortable with these passes and i dont see why any other fan should be these are unnecessarily risky plays that have proven to be costly for us
nba,removed,it is so true warriors fans are the worst trash talkers lmao
nba,removed,kobe bricked aka kobrick
nba,removed,if i had to summarize kyle singler some fag on redditspecifically ukorrangar
nba,removed,on a related note absolutely fuck ufigmentofyourvagina the only thing they posted on rnba was updates to the rape trial and comments regarding what exactly constitutes consent and clearly leaned on the side of the alleged victim the entire trial fuck bringing an agenda into this subreddit and not actually want to discuss anything nba related this is why trials should be kept private until the verdict is in
nba,removed,youre such a crybaby every other thread about the warriors its no surprise to see you whining about the littlest shit its a mans league ok stop getting your feelings hurt
nba,removed,
nba,removed,hes isnt passionate at all he even admitted months ago hes in it for the money and the money only

nba,removed,get the fuck out
nba,removed,over in rsixers there could be a couple of scenarios the team is holding him out to prevent him from getting injured as they look for a trade he had a setback at some point over the summer that they didnt let on about the team is waiting for him to be in shape for him to return to action this was the excuse over the summer at the team usa camp whatever it is id appreciate if the team was more open and honest about whatever is going on all they keep saying is that they expect him to be ready for the opener
nba,removed,lmao remember when you would just post the top comment from old posts onto reposts like a retard did you think you were cool being that unoriginal youre such a faggot hahahahaha
nba,removed,counts in golf every great hoopster plays golf so it counts

nba,removed,how am i shitting on him i said it was blown out of proportion if youd like to refute that be my guest undrafted players wind up doing well quite often across different sports so call me a cynical bastard all you want dude ill just point out that people like you are the reason espn is barely watchable now they got bought by disney and now they cater to people like you whod rather hear about a mediocre player and his amazing story than show live sports or report on athletes who are wroth a damn its why we had to sit through years of tebow bullshit im guessing youre probably one of the guys who read about him hitting a home run in his first atbat and thought wow golly gee that sure is keen
nba,removed,says the guy who had to create an alt account because his main got downvoted to oblivion due to shit posting

nba,removed,well he is a rockets fan and honestly seems like he is probably a cool dude so i cant diss him like that must have just been smoking some crazy shit when he wrote that comment
nba,removed,sebleeds mustve been someone elses experience in the comments of the reddit post they gave him towards a future stubhub purchase which still wasnt close enough to go to the game no youre still wrong they didnt cancel the order the seller did stubhub cannot force the seller to give up the tickets
nba,removed,factually unsupported you mean he doesnt have a history of making brainless decisions you mean he didnt coincidentally pull this stunt right after he gets benched you mean he wasnt back immediately afterward as if there was no emergency you mean there is any evidence corroborated by anyone in roses life or anyone in the media that there was a family emergency in denial ass roseapologist ass

nba,removed,butthurt
nba,removed,not a bad thought actually although i feel like mavs have no need for a sf
nba,removed,nothing over the integer which is what i obviously meant his career high is apg using your brain you can deduce that that means he isnt super likely to have had a balls out assist game the top assist leaders in a single game besides scott skiles are the same list of apg and assist leaders stock kidd magic rondo etc lebron is arguably an equal passer to some of these names but he was never as prolific
nba,removed,i remember jordan saying he was the hardest player he ever had to guard but nothing about him being the hardest defender he might of said it some other time do you have a link only reason im skeptical is because this is a direct quote from jordan the question to michael jordan was who was the best defensive player you ever played against his answer was joe dumars – he was the toughest guy for me to drive by

nba,removed,its probably too long to explain here and im not smart enough to do it justice but ill say this the uncle tomhouse negro as a modern projorative comes from the identity crisis of african americans in this country if youre from a poor urban family that has no college grads or professionals in your upbringing and youre taught to believe that kind of future isnt for you or people like you it is easy to see those things as white ill use a personal example i talk in a very proper tone because i went to a good elementary school that was in the mid nineties later i moved to a city that was black and people said called me nerd white boy lame even adults would clown me for a while i didnt understand it but then you see how so many black people are only familiar with white people in a subordinate role teacher boss police government official so to bring it back to my point when you see a black guy going to duke speaking properly trying to achieve it almost is if they want to be white more importantly i think that gets construed into being not black or trying to run away from your identity making you a uncle tom or house negro

nba,removed,i dont hate anyone im just trying to acknowledge reality and the reality is that if whites were near as racist as you think we are then we wouldnt set up welfare get flooded with immigration the past yrs have quotas affirmative action etc name another majority group that would put up with all the shit that we do you think japan would ever allow themselves to potentially become minorities in their own country and pay welfare for a bunch of them hell no how do you think whites are treated in majority black countries horribly

nba,removed,take lebrons dick out of your mouth he is a whiny bitch who cannot accept criticism he can only when with a stacked team and even when he does he still complains i actually can foresee the cavs losing the east good
nba,removed,he didnt carry us those other years either you idiot i dont care about you growing up in orlando either dwight was a beast then not so much the past years though might aswell end this convo because you cant comprehend what im saying you morons can keep downvoting but that doesnt change the facts that dwight only carried us in that blazers series that we lost josh smith did a hell of a lot more for the team killing the clippers in game than dwight ever did
nba,removed,wtf is wrong with you idiots charles has never done anything but attack players personally specifically their personality theres nothing more personal than that shit and lebron has always taken the high road so in this one instance the script is slightly switched and all you dumb fuckers buy it

nba,removed,warriors just want to end it the land
nba,removed,i guess he just during the finals then

nba,removed,cavs in
nba,removed,if cavs do not win the next game kevin love gets traded
nba,removed,im just here to overreact
nba,removed,lebron nodded
nba,removed,please use this thread for serious discussion only low effort comments will be removed does this include any discussion regarding shumperts hairdo
nba,removed,to bad the cavs are trash on the road so we all know gsw win this series of
nba,removed,warriors fans need to calm down kevin love should be back for game
nba,removed,kyries game plan find a warriors player and score on them
nba,removed,from what ive gathered from this sub we might as well give the trophy to cleveland because its over well have to get it from golden state though because i think we gave them the trophy sunday night when the series was over
nba,removed,the real question now is should the cavs sit or start love for game personally i think he should come off the bench
nba,removed,ernie and now its time for the edition of who he play for charles shakes head aw man ernie alright sir charles well start you off easy first name is kevin love who he play for charles charles well he played in cleveland last year kenny that aint the question chuck who he play for now come on chuck this is a big name charles nervous laughter ernie times up and the answer is charles timberwolves bzzzzt kenny he came from the timberwolves man charles i thought he went back kenny that was kg man thats the wrong kevin charles he coulda gone back too ernie ooo sorry the answer was the brooklyn nets after his exposure in the playoffs and after the cavs won straight without him cleveland traded him to brooklyn for a second round pick and half of a grilled cheese sandwich unfortunately for brooklyn the celtics own the rights to that sandwich shaq at least he got a ring chuck i got tho
nba,removed,i wished for a competitive series which i guess we got but the games themselves are still not competitive sick of all this garbage time
nba,removed,now im not saying taco bell is paying these refs off to make sure we dont get free tacos but taco bell is paying these refs off to make sure we dont get free tacos

nba,removed,it is a make or miss league
nba,removed,totally random question but does anyone know the beatles song they played before commercial during the half i dont remember the lyrics just the rhythm and its been stuck in my head all morning
nba,removed,i think gs will split and take game but im feeling warriors in
nba,removed,i thought this game was hilarious mostly due to how cocky warriors fans were on here and in real life
nba,removed,imagine if lebron was the one having this curry performance so far the backlash wont ever stop but since its curryits all good he aint choking just having a bad finals again
nba,removed,warriors in
nba,removed,cavs in curry fades into obscurity like derrick rose hillary clinton leads america into the golden age of democracy
nba,removed,well ill be damned
nba,removed,i fucking hate kids like you you dumb dicks just throw out phrases and think youre doing shit fuck off
nba,removed,there is a real epidemic in the african american community severe lack of mental health its not even about money obamacare will pay for generics its just frowned upon going to a shrink and taking medication is seen as a sign of being weak and a lot of kids you see doing stupid shit like this i would bet dollars to donuts on the right medication would be an entirely different person ive battled depression my entire life my parents answer to my depression wednesday night bible study they damn near disowned me when i told them i had started taking lexapro i mean what sane person is on an nba team then decides hey im gonna go to texas and break in someones apartment apartment

nba,removed,hes black its unacceptable to give him the benefit of the doubt
nba,removed,lol fuck you
nba,removed,eh i agree with detailed background checks but not a flat out ban on auto weapons
nba,removed,i know right so fuck this guy and his family for him doing it and also fuck the guy who shot him because it was unnecessary all guns should be banned and anyone who has ever committed any sort of crime is a violent criminal and should be locked up and his family shown no sympathy
nba,removed,oh kd pls my ass is too worn out from your monster cock buttfucking me big dawg ouchydraymond green
nba,removed,please kd my donkey ass is sore from your monster cock buttfucking me pls stop emperor

nba,removed,you have got to be a complete fucking moron there is no organization its a huge group of random blacks that are feeling the weight of judgement against them just because a few batshit crazy yet prominent supporters are cunts doesnt mean that the movement is a failure nor does it mean the entire movement condone their point of view if you believe the opposite then there is no hope for you seeing reality any time soon
nba,removed,black lies dont matter

nba,removed,i mean im not living in poverty but you thinking i am and thus thinking that is reason to look down on me and call me peasant pretty much proves my point about you enjoy church on sunday you stupid republican prick cant wait for trump to lose
nba,removed,
nba,removed,i might get some flak for this but the owners are doing alot more by offering jobs though
nba,removed,the plural of anecdote is not data why dont you apply that same logic to the white cop who killed a black person its hilarious how much fucking sympathy your biasing towards blacks apparently now white people are so so far out of control that black people have to start a movement about themselves fuck outta here
nba,removed,arrest is rigged i will not be silenced
nba,removed,that being said what a prick comment from a fanbase that was synonymous with losing for decades the irony here is awesome carry on
nba,removed,i dont live in cleveland anymore hopefully youre not in wi anymore good luck

nba,removed,i like to think that he has a different logo because that suit was hand made for him because they had none near his size
nba,removed,kill yourself liberal faggot
nba,removed,kill yourself you fucking retarded faggot
nba,removed,it turns out okafor isnt the worst player in the nba despite what rsixers says
nba,removed,stop you nutless bastard we dont fraternize with the suns
nba,removed,but hed be discounted because he plays for us can you elaborate on this
nba,removed,thats not what a travel is the fuck
nba,removed,theyre not great by any means but i think henderson and rodriguez were pretty good signings their contracts only have two years and one year respectively and they were sufficient to get adam silver out of sixers affairs so im content
nba,removed,oh i know you gave a reason it was stupid and only further illustrated that youre talking out of your ass
nba,removed,i know wizards fans are going to crucify me but it is a damn shame that a player as talented as wall may never even see the conference finals if he could do that being traded or signing elsewhere and i firmly believe thats his best chance then i hope he goes for it
nba,removed,almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades
nba,removed,the sixers actually made it to an nba finals so no wall is not stuck on the sixers he is stuck on a team that has made the playoffs twice in his tenure with the team but i get it you wouldnt be here if you had something besides an optimistic view of your team i would never be able to convince you even if in five years he hadnt made the conference finals its part of being a fan
nba,removed,no it doesnt youre a fucking idiot
nba,removed,its not that black and white there are better things than two round exits that dont include winning championships
nba,removed,oh let me dumb it down for you if you did not make it to the conference finals you did not make it to the conference finals its not you almost made it it is you did not make it now how that suddenly becomes about the nba finals is beyond me we never discussed value there is no discussion about what makes a season matter it was about whether wall made the conference finals so by that logic nothing fucking matters unless you win the finals is not what you should be concluding and uason smithwholelottaglove inference makes it clear he has probably never taken a logic course in his life more likely he has reasoning skills akin to a child
nba,removed,well if you ever make it to a parallel universe where the wizards are healthy against atlanta let me know until then we are living in the world where they lost
nba,removed,the sixers so like including the sixers team that went to the nba finals are you simple
nba,removed,it is fallacious to equate almost winning a series not being equal to winning a series to nothing mattering if you dont win the finals if you cant figure that out then im sorry for you
nba,removed,the wizards have not been notably better than the sixers over the past fifteen years youre an imbecile
nba,removed,or noel didnt play well on either end and had turnovers in just minutes but nah keep that okafor hate circlejerk going
nba,removed,these refs have made some real shit calls like sarics travel and the foul right there it hasnt made a difference by any means but it is irritating nonetheless
nba,removed,yea and the garbage no contact fouls that okafor got early and ilyasovas megaflop fouls were perfectly called all youre saying is the refs made more shit calls that supports what im saying and yet you come off as a sarcastic ass
nba,removed,what

nba,removed,mexico city wetbacks
nba,removed,i acknowledge him as a superstar i have no doubt about him being one i just dont think he is as transcendent as you think
nba,removed,calderon was good played only minutes tho theres a reason why memphis and toronto passed on gay and mind you toronto was a lottery team no good team has ever tried to sniff him after he left memphis dudes an inefficient scorer who doesnt do much else and takes his sweet time setting up and he only played like minutes that year he played minutes in and left and the raptors were a better offensive team without him derozan was like the shooting guard version of gay at the time but way worse defensively no way were derozan or gay anywhere close to what jrue is offensively right now and jrue is struggling with his shot this year much less in when he had ryan anderson gordon tyreke jrue toney douglas was more valuable offensively than derozan ryan anderson was almost calderonesque good offensively with his outside shooting and off rebounding except he actually played more than minutes a lot more id also take vasquez gordon rolo roberts over amir johnson alan anderson and derozangay next year the cast got even better with ads improvment plus the additions of jrue tyreke and morrow even though anderson played like only minutes and vasquez left we can take the raptors as an example as well minutes of vasquez improved derozan but far from a star amir johnson for minutes and terrance ross best offense in the league the following year we improved to the best offense and the after that best offense you know how had a better impact than lowry on offense that season using any metric anthony davis orpm vs for lowry what youre saying here actually reinforces my initial point in this thread the way davis played in is the ideal role for him offensively he was the best offensive player on the team but it didnt came with him controlling everything like he does now he fed a lot more off tyreke and jrue and allow their playmaking skills to be the force that drives the offense while he had an alltime great season as a scorerfinisher extremely efficient and virtually no turnovers solid floorspacer and screener its not that now hes a worse player skillwise that doesnt really make sense but he plays in a more isocentered role and his impact dropped because he was never good at getting his teammates involved when he had the ball in his hands at no point in history it was what he was doing offball that made him elite offensively in and as you can see lowry still wasnt that far behind davis all things considered and this was a down year for lowry where he had to take a backseat to derozan taking a more focal role within the offense his stats dipped a bit especially his efficiency compared to last season though is where lowry really took the jump to stardom offensively and this year he took a step even beyond that lowry is the catalyst offensively for the raptors he has the ball in his hands and is making the decisions and he shines in that role davis doesnt davis shines when he has players on his team that can take the playmaking load on themselves like jrue tyreke did in and davis can focus on what he does best which is being in that amare stoudamire role when he was in phoenix sorry i had to disappoint you brother but thats how the cookie crumbles ive acknowledge a million times that davis had a trash team to start the year and it does reflect on ones ability to be impactful offensively but you are really overstating the degree or better yet you think davis is better offensively than he really is especially in a primary option role harden had a pretty trash team offensively last season he had beverely and ariza and not much beyond that objectively worse than ad who had ryan anderson gordon jrue douglas and some tyreke in there harden led the rockets to the best offense in the league the pelicans were the best offense in the league thats not even close and harden is playing better this season with ads teammates having career years on his team youre getting owned by someone who hasnt watched basketball in his life that must be utter humiliating face it theres a lot of players in the league who are better offensively than davis as a primary catalyst forget about harden hes way out of his league so are curry lebron westbrook durant lowry kawhi buckets giannis it lillard kemba wall cousins love etc the list is pretty long and optimized davis like he was in could break into the top maybe even further this is a pretty strong year but the way hes playing now he doesnt have the playmaking prowess to lift a bad supporting cast thats why this team needs jrue and tyreke offensively
nba,removed,or chokelahoma city blunders
nba,removed,hahaha i love your post history your username should be shitpostking
nba,removed,no im not discounting that youre putting words in my mouth because youre trying to win one for the pels fanbase or something the thing is calderon was a better player than any of those guys mentioned so him being absent would hurt the raptors a lot more than any of the pels guys missing time individually the point is you had ryan anderson for minutes holiday for minutes gordon for minutes tyreke for minutes the raptors had calderon for minutes alan anderson for mintues gay for minutes and john lucas iii for minutes and these were the raptors best offensive players is this even comparable your offense was better with davis taking a lesser role in dumb dumb and yes having more help contributed to the overall offensive level duh but was it the difference between being and thats why we have there were injuries of course but first lets not act like davis is the only guy whos team is going through injury woes and secondly overall his team had plenty of talent that year but what happened tyreke missed most of the season holiday missed some games the playmaking was gone and gentrys solution was to give ad the ball to carry the offense through him and he couldnt do as good of a job as the upper echelon of offensive nba players like i said the rockets dealt with a lot of injuries in and in the end it was basically harden ariza and beverely who played minutes not a lot more than jrue whos better than beverley offensively anyway and harden still led that team to the best offense in the league lebron has had multiple games where kyrie sat out potentially even love you give him fucking no names like mcrae liggins other teams garbage like jr and shump ancient players that wouldve retired if it werent for lebron like jefferson and james jones and he comes out winning games with those players you know why not because hes putting ppg on his boxscore numbers in those game probably look even less impressive than what davis is doing but lebron is actually an alltime great playmaker which enhances everyone around him while davis is a poor playmaker that doesnt enhance his team on an elite level in a primary catalyst role of course im biased says the guy with the pels flair defending davis to the worlds end lmao also id be nice if youd stop cherrypicking my comments in an attempt to move away from the gist of my arguments ryan anderson has had a bounce back year shooting the ball and gordon has resurrected his career which most thought was dead to being a man candidate all because of hardens ability to make plays for the team and the freedom they have within the offense to shoot fucking derozan averaged pts on with minimal to no playmaking capacity and horrible defense how is that impressive unless youre an idiot taking possessions to score at below league average efficiency and being horrible in other areas every metric paints derozan as garbage and did so until last season still overrated but thats another topic and were talking about here not or i could blindfold myself and pick a random guard in the nba and chances are the guy id get would be able to replicate what derozan was doing that year easily and he played minutes too so this means minutes went to a player who sucked ass yes ill take a solid guard like toney douglas who plays mpg and doesnt spend it on playing basketball taking idiotic shots hell get ppg run the team at a solid capacity and be a threat from land something derozan still to this day doesnt know how to do even though his scoring improved a lot

nba,removed,i saw obama at a grocery store in los angeles i told him how cool it was to meet him in person but i didnt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything he said oh like youre doing now i was taken aback and all i could say was huh but he kept cutting me off and going huh huh huh and closing his hand shut in front of my face i walked away and continued with my shopping and i heard him chuckle as i walked off when i came to pay for my stuff up front i saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen milky ways in his hands without paying the girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like sir you need to pay for those first at first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter when she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually to prevent any electrical infetterence and then turned around and winked at me i dont even think thats a word after she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly
nba,removed,dont let this win distract you from the fact that hilary clinton blew a lead in the nba finals

nba,removed,well im a fan of the team from new orleans and any support for a team playing in a city that tried to steal my team is extremely offensive to me i dont care what your intent is it hearkens back to a dark time where a terrible event caused the death of hundreds of people and tries to paint that in a positive light that is horribly offensive to me basically celebrating the rewards someone else got from someones pain and suffering and death dick
nba,removed,youre right i shouldnt try to equate deaths to from my count on a wikipedia page about murders from i mean seriously you have boxed yourself into a place where you accept no analogy or introspection to show your own faults you act like being homosexual and lgbt issues are the worst issues ever and comparing anything to them is a disservice sounds like youve got quite the superiority complex you took offense to a sarcasticbutnotreallysarcastickindaactuallyalottrue comparison yea i called you a name youre being a rude dick call it how i see it apologies to any men whose penis ive offended for using their organ as a metaphor for a person who i loathe

nba,removed,come on man i am probably the biggest yao fan but considering how many dominant centers there were in the history you really cant say that shaq wilt russell kareem and hakeem are firmly in the top players of all time and all of them are centers i do think you can make a case for yao being top after david robinson if he was healthy and played like years
nba,removed,yea but that kobe missed the playoffs and couldnt even get to the second round till gasol and bynum came around

nba,removed,rondo made his mark on those great celtics teams by being a voracious defender and an excellent distributor he made allnba or team defense years in a row while playing with the big in boston then the big left and back in rondo tore his acl hes never been quite the same since then he has lost a step athletically and is not as quick either sprinting or moving laterally as he was before the injury as a result he hasnt been nearly as effective defensively as a kings fans i can tell you he was awful defensively this year he basically played free safety on defense and gambled for steals most of the year sometimes not even bothering to guard anybody at all on top of that rondo has always been a terrible shooter hes the only guard in the nba that routinely gets hacked because he cant make free throws he took way more this season that he normally does and had his best season ever shooting however these numbers were skewed by the fact that he shot especially well from specifically the right corner on the season he shot from the left corner and from the break and basically only took when he was wide open and had no defender within feet over of the shots he made this season were at the rim and he took hardly any shots outside the paint that werent when you add it all up then what you get is a pg thats on the wrong side of with a knee that has suffered catastrophic injury that needs to be hidden on a team that doesnt require him to play great defense or shoot the ball regularly im optimistic that the kings will let him go this season i still love rondo as a player as he is one of the more exciting flashy pgs to watch but he is not a good fit on this team i still think he can contribute as a starter in the right situation but i think the rest of his team needs to be tailored to hide his weaknesses which is too mi h work for a rebuilding team like sacramento
nba,removed,excluding the nba finals the past seasons including this one cleveland has got days off just twice gs last year got days off twice yet this year times already mainly cuz curry is injured why do people get butt hurt when you mention that is the reason last years conference finals were played every other day and have always been like that nba is rigged and script stay mad i cant wait until these butt hurt warriors fans cry after gs loses in the finals

nba,removed,hes a complete moron and everybodys wasting their time humoring him kyrie and love both had their worst shooting nights of the playoffs on the exact same night thats game right there a team like the cavs can afford for a star or a couple of role players to have a bad night just like the other contenders but to have the core stink it up so bad youll have a hard time winning good thing the odds of that happening are pretty low
nba,removed,your mom has nice tits
nba,removed,do you seriously think the refs are paid or are super biased because if so im sorry youre retarded
nba,removed,honestly wouldnt mind if we banned all these conspiracytards who complain about this
nba,removed,wtf did the modsop delete the post about the tweet when nbastats posted that the cavs would go in the post season i dont see it anymore

nba,removed,lmao probably one of those walmart caliber security guards years old and white
nba,removed,biyombos a nonbird fa max we can offer with that is so the hold is useless scola can come back on vet min round picks are jj is the only useful cap hold that i removed
nba,removed,they can certainly win without him in their game win cleveland he put up just reb ast and a foul in minutes and they won by i think the issue is more about the rotation and how it affects the minute spread and everyone getting in rhythm id imagine ezeli gets the start just to give the team a feeling of continuity
nba,removed,what was the comment right below that it looks like he said something else as well
nba,removed,sounds like izzo would love to feel some of that draymond passion
nba,removed,
nba,removed,draymonds bullshit suspension has changed everything i pray lebitch loses this series

nba,removed,awesome good for craig he is an integral part of the nba watching experience now if only jackson and van gundy could be replaced with people who arent complete idiots
nba,removed,get paid
nba,removed,i never said anything about the rwarriors mods but what kind of mod goes around degrading other mods and calling them bandwagoners in an attempt to make himself look better go do your algebra homework russelldurant
nba,removed,both curry and kyrie average about points per game on pointers the difference is that curry scores those in a much quieter sense than kyrie if you dont find it entertaining to watch steph drill from deep than kyrie is more exciting to watch because a lot of people think that driving by nature is more exciting though steph has some sick finishes as well
nba,removed,i think its hilarious u kids talking about tj u wouldnt say this stuff to him at lan hes jacked not only that but he wears the freshest clothes eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes yall are pathetic lol

nba,removed,lebron james ruined the nba its hard to come to terms with but its true a player who has offered us such historic performances like his point masterpiece against the pistons and the legacy redefining point performance against the celtics has also set the precedent of pursuing championships at whatever cost by teaming up with two potential hall of famers in a historically weak eastern conference james set the precedent for chasing nba championships by coopting rather than beating conference adversaries after initially being vilified james has found enormous off the court success since winning his first championship and has become a fan favorite once again its no surprise that kevin durant has decided to follow a similar route to a championship seeing that it is no longer how you win a championship but simply if the box is checked the eastern conference has had a storied history of crowning a champion over the last thirty years teams in the eastern conference battled playoff victories came with bruises black eyes and ejections there was a genuine competitive animosity between rivals between great players who wanted the same thing a championship the detroit pistons lost two playoff series to the boston celtics but that did not stop the likes of isiah thomas bill lambeer and rick mahorn the pistons pressed on and finally beat the iconic celtics team and went on to play for an nba championship after overcoming even more adversity with a controversial championship loss to the lakers the pistons would go on to win back to back championships the pistons would then serve as the major foil to jordans bulls leading to such friction between the two teams that jordan would use his influence to keep thomas off the historic usa olympic team michael jordan would go on to say that the bulls battles with the pistons made them stronger and helped them have the great championship success one has to wonder how well james knows his nba history in lebron james left the cleveland cavaliers the move came at a particularly interesting time in the power balance of the conference to put it bluntly the eastern conference was wide open for years an on the cusp team would struggle to beat its greatest foe then finally the few would topple the giant and reign supreme over the conference in out of nowhere danny ainge changed things he made a move to trade for ray allen and kevin garnett catapulting them to the top of the eastern conference and an nba championship however the celtics title window was destined to be short the nba season marked kevin garnett and ray allens twelfth years in the league while paul pierce was in his tenth it was a magical run for celtics fans as they beat the lakers to claim their nba championship however the team was not built for sustained success leaving the conference open for a new champion the miami heat much is made of jamess historic run to straight nba finals it is an accomplishment in and of itself but considering the talent that surrounded him in miami is it very surprising james joined a team that already had a strong defensive outlook with the heat ranking second in the conference the additions of both james and chris bosh along with wade would thrust the heat from bottom five in team scoring to second already a member of the miami heat dwayne wade hardly needs an introduction the finals mvp carried his teammates past the dallas mavericks averaging a jawdropping points per game a duo of james and wade would have been formidable but the addition of chris bosh made the miami heat unarguably the most talented team in the eastern conference in boshs toronto years he was a perennial point and rebounds a game player leading the raptors to their first division title and a playoff series in the season the big threes first together saw them top in the conference in scoring with james and wade leading the conference with and points a game respectively and while individual scoring isnt the only measurement of team success the rebounding prowess of their star players as well as the serviceable veterans pat riley managed to acquire made the miami heat leaps and bounds ahead of all eastern conference opponents lebron james was not only able to create a super team in miami but he did it in a conference that was devoid of talent during james historic run to straight finals the eastern conference boasted teams with plus wins not including james teams while the western conference has had an even more startling fact is that james led teams have only beaten eight win teams on their way to the finals to put this into context teams led by kobe bryant have beaten jordan led teams have beaten and duncan led teams have beaten even the stacked bird teams of the faced better competition beating ten win teams when it comes time to rank james among his contemporaries and predecessors it is unfortunate that hell be ultimately judged by the number of rings on his fingers rather than the relatively smooth road that got him there if a four time mvp can form two super teams and have a relatively easy journey to the finals why are we surprised that kevin durant would try and do the same when the likes of stephen a smith say kevin durants move to the warriors is the weakest moveever by a superstar player its hard to not roll ones eyes durant has done everything right since entering the league in the oklahoma city thunders ability to use the draft to surround durant with the likes of russell westbrook serge ibaka and james harden made the team grow together organically facing the great titans of the western conference and learning from their defeats playoff losses to the lakers and mavericks both eventual nba champions would prove to strengthen the thunders resolve in the nba season kevin durant would lead the thunder past the dallas mavericks the los angeles lakers and the san antonio spurs before losing to james miami heat team in the finals like so many great teams before them the thunder proved to have the greatness to knock off storied franchises in the western conference and seemed poised to return to the finals management had other ideas james harden the sixth man of the year in was traded away after not agreeing to a contract that was far below his market place rather than pay the luxury tax the thunder opted to discard the future mvp candidate for an assortment of assets that would result in nothing more than steven adams kevin durant would use twitter to share his reaction wow he said but that threeletter word would be all he said on the matter durant supported management and continued his stellar play on the court winning the mvp award in the season the oklahoma city thunder would never return to the nba finals coming one win short during the last season after nine years kevin durant decided to leave the thunder for the golden state warriors how surprised can we really be with durants decision if every championship is equal then who is to say durants decision is wrong as fans of the game we are partly to blame for the prevailing notion that a player without championships cannot be seen as truly great we are partly to blame for our inability to articulate that the journey to a championship is as important as the title itself when the san antonio spurs won the nba championship it was hard not to smile knowing what they overcame to not only go to the finals but redeem themselves with a championship what makes basketball and sports in general so special is that it can be a metaphor for life where hardwork loyalty teamwork and most importantly adversity can one day lead to accomplishing ones goal lebron james ruined the nba because he made the end result more important than the journey and created the precedent that championships were to be craved above all else no matter how theyre won
nba,removed,shutup fag boi
nba,removed,last time he did it hurt him wavy flashback transition fuck this shit im going to golden state westbrook lmao youre so gay

nba,removed,i didnt mention any specific site i know what was said and im not really arguing about that not here anyway this site isnt an established platform theyre a new set up they literally state it in the post this ama is literally a way to use the community to get off the ground its done in an engaging way and im all for it but there are probably a dozen other sites that were refused the same opportunity thats all im saying
nba,removed,if youre going to call out my website in your response to put yourself on a pedestal please leave my replies up as well its just as unrelated as my comments
nba,removed,believe me being a fan of him has not been easy past years youre preaching to the choir theres a difference between shitting on someone and saying theyre inconsistent reread my original comment some people are able to be objective about players they like others arent i love my mom too doesnt mean i cant be real and say her deviled eggs arent very good im only talking about basketball youre the one talking about your emotional response to someone being critical of a player you like i cant help that the sub is shitty about derrick ive dealt with it for years hes had a great stretch he had a few of those last year too and the year before i got excited every time so now im going to hold off until he shows he can string a few good months together i like the guy dont be so sensitive the only one flaming anyone is you i mean am i only allowed to talk about rose is i say positive things i have a rose jersey hanging in my officecurrently give me a break
nba,removed,really or is it not yours he can shoot even then he has terrible offnights unanimous mvp mvp cant show up for important games all he is is overrated af the night he performs in the playoffs with an allstar team he might become top until then never lmao those who think curry is top are those who say lebron isnt the best in the league yaall could put any pg in the league on currys team and they wouldnt choke or underperform as hard regular season aint mean shit lebron could win that times over if he wanted too but hes a good player so he rests more for the playoffs and just destroys everyone they even had the best bench in the league cavs had terrible in comparison still lost kyrie who isnt considered top smacked currys ass all the way to fucking hawaii so i guess hes top then or are you just plain dumb i watch basketball and i appreciate greatness but someone who havent proved shit doesnt even deserve to be in that conversation the day he actually performs and brings his team to a relevant state without other allstars then we can talk right now he has the best starter team yet fails it amuses me some people like you are dumb enough to consider him that good

nba,removed,false because lebron jame shad shown to lost to four teams in the finals if he kept his record and there were no conference play he wouldve played mavericks spurs and warriors much sooner in the playoffs beyond that spurs are a great matchup against lebron and he certainly wouldve had to play them more than three times
nba,removed,so if the best team didnt make it to the finals each year and lebron has to play them earlier in the playoffs you think lebron would still go to straight finals shut the fuck up dude your parents regret abortion for you right

nba,removed,thats what makes the book so great because it focuses on three things investing spending saving investing ive made considerable interest in my roth ira since and i even put a couple thousand dollars in the nasdaq that made a few percentage points returns in a few months i also do my company match for my at work and that brings interest with it saving the goal of a savings account is to have at least months of expenses for me i want it to be months of income i got the months expenses done within a year of aggressive saving i managed to get to months of income in my emergency account but due to recent expenses motorcycle and additional aftermarket purchases i have to save more to get it back there spending ramit calls it conscious spending where you should spend extravagantly on the things they lovebut you have to cut costs mercilessly on the things you dont and this is the differentiation between ramit and other personal finance people other blogs will talk about how spending for a mocha at starbucks adds up to hundreds of dollars a year but what if you like your starbucks mocha thats where spend as much as you want on the things you love but aggressively cut spending in other areas people love to talk to about a savings plan and obviously thats important but its almost as important to have a spending plan lets be honest we all like to spend money buying things we love as long as you are conscious about your spending its not necessarily a bad thing
nba,removed,everyone keeps harping change the rules how many rules are going to be changed until theres none plus you guys are going to get rid of fouls lolplease

nba,removed,lebron gets a pass for an inordinate amount of fuckery hes a media darling the league protects him and forces us to choke down a bullshit narrative that hes potentially a goat hes not not even close he plays by a different set of rules has a direct line to the commissioner and the refs hes and flops multiple times a game he cant shoot free throws or three pointers im not even going to delve into his numerous off court transgressions but needless to say if you examine his career objectively there really isnt any greatness to appreciate
nba,removed,bring him home
nba,removed,hes a better drive and kick guy also also a better ball handler than nance but nance seems like a great player but id prefer to have randle on the floor and develop with the breakfast club only if they didnt get mosgov could have played small ball with russell clarkson deng randle and nance d

nba,removed,was reading a thread on askreddit about racism with black people and it really opened my eyes to the subconcious discrimination some people do without even noticing

nba,removed,i just want to take a moment to say something fuck you i was that little kid once upon a time i ordered a pizza and had it delivered all i had was tips from helping my brother work at a snowball stand so it was all coins and i tipped the pizza delivering faggot as well cause i figured all the coins were a hassle the asshole walks up to the door and i hand him change and he says if theres not enough money in here im coming back so i told him to keep the fucking pizza took the money back and called the pizza joint who said he would be paying for the pizza so since youre probably him fuck you
nba,removed,youre a dumbass they answered my question i stated how lebron did well when i look at the highlights and some guy says oh you answered your own question just shut the fuck up killjey im responding to tutaes idiotic comment youre just a dumb cunt
nba,removed,good lord youre such a douche really
nba,removed,does it throw you an error
nba,removed,you so totally just wanted to use edge case
nba,removed,the aesthetics or lack there of of this post gave me cancer

nba,removed,you can thank dangeslow snitch bustell for that
nba,removed,i am obsessed with nba player nikola vučević this is my confession i do not watch nba basketball however my friends started a fantasy basketball league last year and implored me to join i crashed my car into a tree while trying to draft from my phone never again so i autodrafted thats where it began my center was a guy named vučević and he was getting me points nonstop kyle lowry are paul george were two other guys who were good for me i got to draft the first two rounds and they were the guys i picked and soon i was on top of league and vooch thats what id started calling him was one of my top scorers i cant explain why i began to obsess over him maybe its because he kinda looks like me maybe its because i like his last name a lot but i started watching his highlight tapes and then i started watching his games everytime he dunked i felt like a proud mother i know nothing about the city of orlando but i watched the whole for documentary about them because i was hoping he would be in it somewhere but he wasnt now im mad at orlando because he should be starting and theyre not starting him i want vooch to read this i want him to know im his biggest fan even though i dont root for his team and that he should go somewhere that starts him i want him to know that hes one of the best players in the league and he should ask for center money i want him to know that i love him i know players come to these subreddits sometimes and answer questions so if vooch ever comes here please forward this to him and if anyone knows how i can contact him just to send him an email i know it will be going to his agent and not him id love to tell him that hes made me a real basketball fan sincerely nikola vučevićs number one fan
nba,removed,you couldnt read a picture book theres plenty of worthy books by coaches to read before i would ever pick up blowhard george karls book go watch survivor doughboy

nba,removed,says the guy who is subscribed to rhotfireman not judging at all
nba,removed,the refs have been so good this game world class it good that professionals like this can create an environment where the better team will always win
nba,removed,the ref whining in this thread is unfucking believable im seriously disappointed the bitches toronto has for fans
nba,removed,you are a piece of work
nba,removed,no offense but the warriors shouldnt be in close games against garbage teams i mean really warriors fans are just gonna be sad when they get shit on by lebron again cus steph is garbage come post season and kd chokes when hes up too lata bitch
nba,removed,i think its hilarious that you live in a shit hole hope the floods come again during the playoffs cause when they do we win
nba,removed,tbh man its funny how redditors collectively believe upvotes and downvotes make you a better person warriors fans that dont even live in the bay area and are from miami shits comical motha fuckas still livin with they daddys

nba,removed,allen and jordan but no dpoy kwahightmare come on giannis is a top defender and has no position there is not one single player who he cannot dunk the ball on so hard his grandmother is aching and the man can pass the ball and the shot is starting to come around when he chills and he isthe best player on his team at years old i love lowry and you are right he is the integral part of some of the best lineups this season but there is only one player in the east coming for the crown giannis shout outs to jimmy b demar isaiah thomas and my man rick sanchez merry swishmiss to everyone
nba,removed,probably because lebron has already cemented himself as goat anyone who thinks otherwise is just hating or lost in nostalgia
nba,removed,so just be okay with being held do try to break free you a fool
nba,removed,youre an idiot
nba,removed,lmao lil kid fans fuming

nba,removed,who the fuck is us you seem to like including yourself in arguments that have nothing to do w you in order to feel relevant lebron was better than kidd in every aspect of the game that series so what you said makes no sense thanks for trying genius

nba,removed,its just funny when trump says america needs to be great again certain segments of the population clap when kaepernick essentially says the same thing that hell stand when we uphold the ideals that the flag represents those same people excoriate him not to mention blm has virtually nothing to do with the military dont get it twisted white people

nba,removed,choked up just like he saved lebron from choking in the finals again and having a record
nba,removed,i can already see the bronsexual sitting there at his computer upon seeing a prokobe post he exclaims aww man this sucks downvotes backspaces and goes to watch bron mixes this video is specifically made for you if you are that guy which you are if you are the average rnba redditor first of all lebron is a top wing of all time top this has nothing to do with lebron this has to do with all of you bron boys who constantly send me the most ridiculous opinions when it pertains to leking you act like he walks on water lebron has a good stretch of games and thats an indication of his goat status to the tards lebron has a stretch of brutally bad games well he has bad teammates lebron hits a tough shot thats why hes the goat the times that lebron tried to hit that shot and missed well excuse excuse excuse lebron gets paid million a year thats because hes the goat and he deserves it someone like kobe gets paid million and suddenly hes greedy lebron scores in the finals twice in a row amazing goat status lebron scores points in one finals game and gets outscored by bench player jason terry during the entire series that never happened lebron racks up more triples doubles than people like jordan and kobe is indicative of his goat status but the fact that he has had coaches whose offensive game plans are to run the offense through him rather than triangle sets emphasizing teamwork is ignored life of a delusional bronsexuals furthermore lebron has it so hard and thats why he struggleseveryone else scores their buckets easily and defenses roll out a red carpet to the basket so they can score wade was an overrated highusage twoguard he actually wasnt arguably the most effective slasher in the modern nba chris bosh is softweaka dinosaur he actually didnt perform at a very high level on the way to their championships by adjusting his came to become a stretch who could also effectively defend the post lebrons supporting cast is garbage the cavaliers actually dont have the highest payroll in the nba kobum didnt shake hands in the playoffs against the suns well lebrom james actually didnt walk off the court without shaking hands with dwight howard kobe quit against the suns in but king james didnt quit on the cavaliers against boston kobe is an asshole for demanding a trade when he had a punch of kwame brown and smush parker but lebron james is a hero for leaving his team as a free agent twice the contradictions are absolutely hilarious but so ignorant at the same time celebrity worship syndrome and pathetic vicarious living at its finest level lebron would also have more awards like dpoy and mvp and all that jazz if the media didnt like other superstars so much yeah the same media thats all over his nutsack and constantly overrates his legacy defense and offensive ability screw kobrick cryant dwyane wade dwight howard kevin durant stephen curry et cetera these guys never deserved mvps even if they got them andeven though they outperformed lebron the first two years lebron won mvp kobe howard and wade were the most deserving players lebron deserved and there is footage of kobe blocking lebron hitting jumpers over lebron shaking lebron so hard his ankles snap running over lebron like he was a point guard driving to the basket on lebron answering a lebron miss with a make hitting game winners over lebron stopping lebron game winner attempts stealing the ball from lebron and basically just owning lebron over and over again so please stop talking about lebron being the goat because clearly youre too young to know what youre talking about basketball isnt played on box scores made in microsoft excel its played on the court

nba,removed,let me direct you to this article with the headline the sixers to play ben simmons at point guard including defensively brett brown was actually more certain than udanacarvey mentioned he didnt say its a possibility he said its happening go fuck yourself with your shitty attitude especially when youre totally wrong hahah
nba,removed,iirc he repeatedly declined the free tickets to games because of some excuse or another until it was a playoff game and at that point draymond was unable to get him proper tickets so he ended up with standing tickets then he threw a hissy fit i also think this dude fun fact i know him from college got himself blocked by draymond on twitter because he was heckling him
nba,removed,florida yes dade no
nba,removed,alright well lets be careful not to overreact in either direction just because you havent met people like that in your experience doesnt mean they dont exist down there is getting downvoted for just saying that he has in fact met these sjws i have too im a brown dude fortunately i havent encountered much firsthand racism recently but it would clearly be ridiculous for me to assume that because i see far more people complaining about it racism than any actual examples claims of racism must be exaggerated
nba,removed,dude stop being a faggot this is exactly whats wrong with out pc ass culture stop stretching something into something you can be offended by you special flower nothing but a trouble maker

nba,removed,rnba loved draymond before he started pulling this shit they also hated the league for not booting him in the playoffs against the thunder and still hate the league for refusing to touch him this season im not sure what comments youve read that are giving the league a pass but i am sure theyre in the minority obviously i agree with you and the idiot above me that the league needs to stop it because green wont however hes taking it a step further and clearing green of all personal responsibility which is horseshit if youre going to play dirty and endanger those around you to gain an advantage youre going to be justifiably hated

nba,removed,warriors fans are still trying to rationalize a world where lebron isnt their daddy enjoy getting exposed this year pussy
nba,removed,fuck serbia
nba,removed,nice straw man blaming nato for serbias problems good thing the united states had classically tight rules of engagement showing serbs the mercy that the serbs themselves refused to grant the the civilians they were killing en masse and tossing into mass unmarked graves how about this instead if you commit ethnic cleansing you might be inviting a own international response during that international response it is reasonable to expect some of your civilians might be caught in the crossfire the united states didnt force the serbs to start killing their neighbors and if you invite an international response those dead serbian civilians are just more blood on the hands of the serbian government the peoples irrational hatred of the us in that circumstance is similar to the guy whos wife cheats on him and instead of being angry at the wife he gets angry at the guy who didnt even know she was married if the serbian people are angry with the bombing perhaps they should be angry with themselves instead for killing civilians and thinking people would just stand by and let the slaughter happen

nba,removed,fellow referee danny crawford attended michael jordans flight school camp years ago and later told tim donaghy that he had long conversations with other referees and nba players about how bavetta propped up weak teams danny told me that jordan himself said that everyone in the league knew that bavetta cheated in games and that the players and coaches just hoped he would be cheating for them on game night cheating thats a very strong word to use in any sentence that includes the name dick bavetta is the conscious act of helping a team crawl back into a contest cheating the credo of referees from high school to the nba is call them like you see them of course thats a lot different than purposely calling more fouls against one team as opposed to another did bavetta have a hidden agenda or was he the ultimate company man making sure the nba and its fans got a competitive game most times he was on the court studying under dick bavetta for years was like pursuing a graduate degree in advanced game manipulation he knew how to marshal the tempo and tone of a game better than any referee in the league by far he also knew how to take subtle — and not so subtle — cues from the nba front office and extend a playoff series or worse yet change the complexion of that series

nba,removed,r mod team the nba encourages its players to talk about social justice adam silver rallied against lebron and the cavs stood up for trayvon martin and the the nba put bill kennedy on an nba themed float at a gay rights parade you should let us talk about the thoughtful things people around the league have to say about our country

nba,removed,by pointing out the obvious my comment wasnt against him or promoting him trumps hostility towards people he disagreed with got him a shit ton of love like one of his selling points was that he wasnt going to play nice and he was going to speak his mind hes a very polarizing figure polarizing figures tend to create hostility im not saying hostility is the answer but i also think it was expected theres a reason you shouldnt talk politics with friends shit gets hostile lol
nba,removed,teamkarine
nba,removed,its kind of hard to believe after seeing how both of their games have evolved in different ways over the years since the trade but at the time their play style was too similar to coexist they both needed the ball to be effective monta didnt stretch the floor well for curry and curry wasnt quite the off the ball spot up shooter that he is now that and theyre both the same height similar size they just didnt work well together anyone else remember right after the monta trade when all the warriors fans booed lacob at a jersey retirement ceremony oh how times have changed

nba,removed,there was an rnba demographic survey i think last year and it asked how long youve followed the league the part that i remember was that only had followed long enough to have known preheat lebron and only had followed long enough to have seen wades first championship lotta ai dickriders around here in light of the mass confusion over the history of the word posse
nba,removed,you cant compare a tv show to a movie the first four episodes the governor was in did you expect him to end up being as great of a villain as he was lmfao the governor was an even more villain than negan also i posted this reply here because i am banned from the walking dead sub

nba,removed,they have their own insult already mentally ill
nba,removed,strongly consider suicide
nba,removed,i didnt realize how stupid you are when i made my first comment playing the bulls wont magically make him better so it is stupid to predict that a bad player will have a great game against a particular team given the context of your superstitious nonsense i would have commented differently
nba,removed,this guys an idiot kris dunn cant shoot average player russell playmaking scoring guard i could do this for every position but thatd be a waste of time lavine and kat and wiggins are nice but are nowhere near as explosive and impressive as the five youth lineup of dlo clarkson ingram randle double double in mpg idiots and zupac

nba,removed,the dog looks tasty no homo thechinkwithinme
nba,removed,yea no way orlando could deal with improving all aspects of thier existence its just too much for florida to handle at one time
nba,removed,
nba,removed,i doubt kyrie could have contained lillards athleticism nearly as well as he did on steph
nba,removed,ive watched the game times now i always watch big games at least twice i never mentioned he had a bad game just that it wasnt the most impressive triple double fuck off
nba,removed,thats not giving kyrie enough credit he was a pest all series thats not to say he was allnba defensively i have seen others opinions that he was one of the worst defensive point guards in the league which may be true but he showed up after game with intensity and just being a pest in general
nba,removed,lefag leflop lebum and lechoke amirite
nba,removed,yeah apparently dude invests a lot of energy into hating on curry and gets fucking pissed when he gets praised
nba,removed,so instead of going after a great young guard like derozan the knicks traded for dl rose and are talking to chandler parsons fuck this team im tired of this shit
nba,removed,no you must be a complete idiot if you think there defensive plays arent a thing in basketball ill give you a few examples zone zone zone its pretty clear you dont know shit about basketball and that you dont know shit about what those are if you seriously just said defensive plays arent a thing and yes when they play teams with elite pgs klay does end up usually on the opposing pg i never said hes a bad defender anyways but he is hidden on defense and teams do run pnrs to get curry off who kerr has him on did you see the okc and cavs games or the spurs regular season games anyways its pretty clear you have no idea about what defense even is considering you actually said defensive plays arent a thing
nba,removed,i stand by them
nba,removed,seems a bit gay to me being a faggot isnt a big deal theres a lot here anyways
nba,removed,you guys are supposed to say over or under and then give your own question no one is participating what the fuck

nba,removed,hes a racist troll who made a popular post roasting jabari parker for having no friends why did he make that post in the first place because parker spoke out against the police
nba,removed,damn mike was real as fuck i wonder how much repercussion hed get in todays soft media if he used the word faggot like that
nba,removed,terrible defense terrible rebounding and overhyped as an offensive player to elaborate one of the worst defensive players in the league he could not defend either pf or c at all atrocious in that regard makes enes kanter look like a dpoy candidate cant rebound to save his life if youre not getting even just passable rebounding out of your pfc you better have a damn good reason to even play him which leads us to overrated offensive player people that look at his ppg taking lots of shots on a terrible team without considering his efficiency are complete idiots his offensive boxscore plusminus has been negative over the course of career meaning he is a below average offensive player while he has been a solid point shooter about for his career he takes a ton of terrible shots like long and cant finish at the rim which completely mitigates that in summary hes a below average offensive player while being one of the worst defensive players in the league the result is that he has been one of the worst players in the league for years in fact several advanced stats have rated him as such like win wages just watching him play confirms his terribleness bargnani is the one player that proves to me that this sub either doesnt understand basketball or never actually watches the games because rnba doesnt seem to appreciate how truly bad he actually is
nba,removed,oh fuck
nba,removed,get off reddit and never come back you and your team are nothing more than a meme
nba,removed,i think hell be an all star eventually but hell make an alldefensive team before then after the post seasonim hoping hell make it this year and just a side note for some reason he always plays very well against rudy gobert
nba,removed,why while he does say some dumb stuff occasionally relatively speaking when he speaks on social issues he seems to have an objective and moderate position i trust him to be able to separate facts from emotion hes done so in the past with several hot takes
nba,removed,he would have to jump over a building to catch up
nba,removed,i cant roast the team that gave us dirk so thank you bucks
nba,removed,gay gay gay
nba,removed,man i going to have to disagree just looking at the stats wont tell you the whole story about the development of a player jc improved a lot from his first year cant say much about harris because i only see him play a few times but i dont miss laker games and record missed games jc has improved a lot from his first year
nba,removed,their games are vastly different
nba,removed,im not sure what youre trying to do but you made me think way too hard about that just to conclude that youre flat out wrong

nba,removed,so now you change your focus to something else lie i didnt change shit just because other people asked for an apology doesnt mean i asked for it also even if i had asked for the apology i think it is implied that people want an honest and sincere apology that takes responsibility for what he did for instance if green said im sorry that white faggot was rubbing his nuts all on my leg youd have to be pretty out of touch to try to say that green had apologized and bash other people for changing their focus if they didnt want to accept it even if draymond could provide factual evidence that it was accidental you would still find a way to hate him support that i mean fuck i dont even hate him now sure i think he plays sports like a dirt ball and lies about it so he can avoid getting in trouble but that isnt really that big a deal in the grand scheme of things

nba,removed,nope im a native but still nobody will believe in the raptors until they accomplish a finals appearance for the time assuming what your asking is even possible not likely that russ reaches tdot in fa maybe but that backcourt would have absolutely no spacing and would not work

nba,removed,lebron james ruined the nba its hard to come to terms with but its true a player who has offered us such historic performances like his point masterpiece against the pistons and the legacy redefining point performance against the celtics has also set the precedent of pursuing championships at whatever cost by teaming up with two potential hall of famers in a historically weak eastern conference james set the precedent for chasing nba championships by coopting rather than beating conference adversaries after initially being vilified james has found enormous off the court success since winning his first championship and has become a fan favorite once again its no surprise that kevin durant has decided to follow a similar route to a championship seeing that it is no longer how you win a championship but simply if the box is checked the eastern conference has had a storied history of crowning a champion over the last thirty years teams in the eastern conference battled playoff victories came with bruises black eyes and ejections there was a genuine competitive animosity between rivals between great players who wanted the same thing a championship the detroit pistons lost two playoff series to the boston celtics but that did not stop the likes of isiah thomas bill lambeer and rick mahorn the pistons pressed on and finally beat the iconic celtics team and went on to play for an nba championship after overcoming even more adversity with a controversial championship loss to the lakers the pistons would go on to win back to back championships the pistons would then serve as the major foil to jordans bulls leading to such friction between the two teams that jordan would use his influence to keep thomas off the historic usa olympic team michael jordan would go on to say that the bulls battles with the pistons made them stronger and helped them have the great championship success one has to wonder how well james knows his nba history in lebron james left the cleveland cavaliers the move came at a particularly interesting time in the power balance of the conference to put it bluntly the eastern conference was wide open for years an on the cusp team would struggle to beat its greatest foe then finally the few would topple the giant and reign supreme over the conference in out of nowhere danny ainge changed things he made a move to trade for ray allen and kevin garnett catapulting them to the top of the eastern conference and an nba championship however the celtics title window was destined to be short the nba season marked kevin garnett and ray allens twelfth years in the league while paul pierce was in his tenth it was a magical run for celtics fans as they beat the lakers to claim their nba championship however the team was not built for sustained success leaving the conference open for a new champion the miami heat much is made of jamess historic run to straight nba finals it is an accomplishment in and of itself but considering the talent that surrounded him in miami is it very surprising james joined a team that already had a strong defensive outlook with the heat ranking second in the conference the additions of both james and chris bosh along with wade would thrust the heat from bottom five in team scoring to second already a member of the miami heat dwayne wade hardly needs an introduction the finals mvp carried his teammates past the dallas mavericks averaging a jawdropping points per game a duo of james and wade would have been formidable but the addition of chris bosh made the miami heat unarguably the most talented team in the eastern conference in boshs toronto years he was a perennial point and rebounds a game player leading the raptors to their first division title and a playoff series in the season the big threes first together saw them top in the conference in scoring with james and wade leading the conference with and points a game respectively and while individual scoring isnt the only measurement of team success the rebounding prowess of their star players as well as the serviceable veterans pat riley managed to acquire made the miami heat leaps and bounds ahead of all eastern conference opponents lebron james was not only able to create a super team in miami but he did it in a conference that was devoid of talent during james historic run to straight finals the eastern conference boasted teams with plus wins not including james teams while the western conference has had an even more startling fact is that james led teams have only beaten eight win teams on their way to the finals to put this into context teams led by kobe bryant have beaten jordan led teams have beaten and duncan led teams have beaten even the stacked bird teams of the faced better competition beating ten win teams when it comes time to rank james among his contemporaries and predecessors it is unfortunate that hell be ultimately judged by the number of rings on his fingers rather than the relatively smooth road that got him there if a four time mvp can form two super teams and have a relatively easy journey to the finals why are we surprised that kevin durant would try and do the same when the likes of stephen a smith say kevin durants move to the warriors is the weakest moveever by a superstar player its hard to not roll ones eyes durant has done everything right since entering the league in the oklahoma city thunders ability to use the draft to surround durant with the likes of russell westbrook serge ibaka and james harden made the team grow together organically facing the great titans of the western conference and learning from their defeats playoff losses to the lakers and mavericks both eventual nba champions would prove to strengthen the thunders resolve in the nba season kevin durant would lead the thunder past the dallas mavericks the los angeles lakers and the san antonio spurs before losing to james miami heat team in the finals like so many great teams before them the thunder proved to have the greatness to knock off storied franchises in the western conference and seemed poised to return to the finals management had other ideas james harden the sixth man of the year in was traded away after not agreeing to a contract that was far below his market place rather than pay the luxury tax the thunder opted to discard the future mvp candidate for an assortment of assets that would result in nothing more than steven adams kevin durant would use twitter to share his reaction wow he said but that threeletter word would be all he said on the matter durant supported management and continued his stellar play on the court winning the mvp award in the season the oklahoma city thunder would never return to the nba finals coming one win short during the last season after nine years kevin durant decided to leave the thunder for the golden state warriors how surprised can we really be with durants decision if every championship is equal then who is to say durants decision is wrong as fans of the game we are partly to blame for the prevailing notion that a player without championships cannot be seen as truly great we are partly to blame for our inability to articulate that the journey to a championship is as important as the title itself when the san antonio spurs won the nba championship it was hard not to smile knowing what they overcame to not only go to the finals but redeem themselves with a championship what makes basketball and sports in general so special is that it can be a metaphor for life where hardwork loyalty teamwork and most importantly adversity can one day lead to accomplishing ones goal lebron james ruined the nba because he made the end result more important than the journey and created the precedent that championships were to be craved above all else no matter how theyre won
nba,removed,i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about harden u wouldnt say this shit to him at lan hes jacked not only that but he wears the freshest clothes eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes yall are pathetic lol

nba,removed,was standing in line at the supermarket the other day when i turned around to see none other than the black mamba standing behind me as i turned in amazement he smiled and extended his hand for me to shake still in shock and amazed at his demeanor must be retirement i thought to myself i nervously raised my arm my fingers contorted into a fist anticipating a switch up at the point of contact instead he continued reaching stretching past me with that crustacean wing span and grabbing the divider off the counter in one swift motion he slid the divider in front of my vegan cottage cheese placed his two body armor drinks on the counter and stepped ahead of me in line i tried to say something but only mumbles came out and i stared at the intimidating back of his head looking down at me seemingly beckoning me to stay in silence hi mr bryant will that be all for you today the large cashier casually asked the man in front of me staring intently at the round cashier kobe coldly handed him three dollars and fifty cents exactly never breaking eye contact that warm smile that had graced his face just moments before had all but disappeared ttthank you sir the cashier stuttered still maintaining eye contact kobe replied youre welcome then glancing back at me kobe winked and proclaimeddominate check out lines as kobe walked out of the store a man scooted past me in line clutching a snickers bar to his leg just as he reached the register he turned around and i instantly recognized him as steve blake i opened my mouth but the words came out of his first i barely had time to process what he said before he had turned and run out of the supermarket finally the words rang out across my eardrums seemingly delayed by the magnitude of the quake he had laid on me those words said loud and clear no one will believe you

nba,removed,all i got out of any of that wasthe warriors blew a lead
nba,removed,uh thanks chinaman
nba,removed,lol you fucking moron im a fan of cleveland sports i havent been there before know where i was before though on the other end of you fucks claiming the east was the minor leagues and portland was the real finals ive been on the other end of nope from draymond green i was on the other end of open mockery for a year about how the cavs lost to the mighty warriors so you know what stop claiming a higher moral ground you dont have and suck it down the cavs shoved their dicks down your throats and you dont have to enjoy it for the rest of the sports world to enjoy it
nba,removed,thats not explaining how curry can beat you if hes cold thats called changing my logic to not actually be logical anymore and then trying to turn it against me you also have clearly never watched harden i guess harden can beat you from from mid or from slashing andor fts curry beats you from thats it he gets free layups because of his own threat from deep so what happens when curry isnt hitting well as seen the other night he goes for points first game of the season harden goes from deep scores on shots if you dont get what im saying by now youre just an idiot
nba,removed,this is like the white privilege of rnba people critize kd for absolutely legitimate reasons the warriors do get away with a lot of moving screens draymond plays dirty as fuck and is a loud mouth that says incredible ignorant things people hate on the warriors because they do some pretty hateable things and it doesnt hurt that win a lot too which brings more attention grow up lol
nba,removed,maybe throw yourself into a lake
nba,removed,lmao do some research but heres the biggest one no one cares about what he paul fucking pierce did come on dude you can be a warriors fan and acknowledge the stupid stuff he says and all the knocks on the warriors dont be ignorant thats why warriors fans have a bad rep here they block out all criticism on their team instead of showing poise and honesty i hate the warriors i hate all super teams but im not going to say they are bad at basketball when the evidence proves otherwise the same goes for everything i said about the negative associations with them evidence is clearly there doesnt make them a worse team just gives them a bad rep
nba,removed,unlike you i dont hold a bias though i see things for what they are and let the facts speak for themselves
nba,removed,this is exactly why rnba hates on warriors fans youre a great representation
nba,removed,you dont know how to swim or what
nba,removed,oh boo hoo an internet stranger is being mean to you fuck off theres worse stuff going on
nba,removed,im not crying
nba,removed,lol youre mad as fuck and that gives me a bad case of laughing at you suck it down savor it enjoy it taste its salty sweetness know it well
nba,removed,yup thats the lead the warriors lost in the finals i already know no worries i made light of the stupid fucking warriors fans already man it pisses them off so bad
nba,removed,clearly you arent actually aware of the word denial just in it
nba,removed,yup my denial isnt gonna let me watch that but dont let that distract you from the fact that the warriors lost a lead in the finals
nba,removed,lmao i find it funny you think i have an obsession because im sitting here arguing with you thats straight up adorable
nba,removed,the one were in
nba,removed,yeah he is cavs fans are just butthurt and defensive about it sure he wont catch him in volume stats or of all star games or whatever but he will in the things that actually matter mvps and rings are easily the two most important criteria when comparing all time greats curry is about to be tied in rings and will catch up in mvps shortly hes already eclipsing lebitch lmfao youre a little bay area bitchboy knew it you should probably delete your account and start fresh because its instant entertainment reading your shit comments open your account during the playoffs to spew your garbage opinions only to watch your team get sonned by legoat unanimous mvps every other player in nba history lol you cant stand the fact that somebody might be better than curry at something your comments should be enshrined so everybody knows how much of a fucking moron you are god it was fun reading those oh and btw just a lil tease currys five worst shooting games last year points on shots hardens five worst shooting games last year points on shots fta in other words as i said curry just keeps chucking harden gets to the line get sonned bitchboy and dont expect another response after i witnessed your retardedass comment history
nba,removed,pfft like i look at flairs i just have nothing to do and since its warriors circle jerk time figured id piss in the fire really hate their cocky fanbase
nba,removed,im rather confused by this can you elaborate cuz the media clearly had a one sided agenda and all the headlines were pretty blatant about hillary is leading here and there turned out not to be the case thankfully but wouldnt one who doesnt actually read into the real content assume the frontpage media is right which isnt what turned out to be true in the election i just cant wrap my head around what youre saying how do you think we got the president we just did none of the major media was saying trump was gonna win that one might have been my favorite i had to actually read through the actual content mostly by watching the rallies trumps were a lot different than clintons and i had a good feeling after his last one in east lansing tuesday night that he was gonna pull it off so in my case i didnt look at any media headlines i dug in by listening to the nominees themselves and crowds and the local news in the respected areas on the contrary if i just listened to the media or this lovely freudian slip up by cnn i would have assumed clinton won unless you were trying to say that people just assumed by not reading into the actual content and hearing the headlines only that they figured the election was over and didnt need to vote to support their candidate
nba,removed,tgtttg
nba,removed,lmao you try so hard but you just come off as hopelessly angry at the world around you projecting how you feel on others no ones angry but you youre the only one bashing your keyboard to respond as angrily and quickly as possible most of the rest of us are bored now and have moved on and frankly your responses are really getting low effort and im thinking i might have to move on from you here
nba,removed,what a coincidence i didnt have to read any of it to figure out you are a moron
nba,removed,i was kyrie with the rock the crack game number now im older still ballin like my name uncle drew fabolous steppin in my margielas this nina like my umbrella ballin like im carmelo and kinging like im coretta meek mill now she talkin that ept tryna have me back on ebt no not me i had to clip her like bibby

nba,removed,idiots and why not as often as bobble heads
nba,removed,where could one find game stats nbc olympics site blows
nba,removed,he seems to make a habit out of this greatness thing huh
nba,removed,they couldnt design a ball hog
nba,removed,probably took a picture of his house and the girl across the street filed complaints its how the world works now
nba,removed,my time is limited i have pancake cancer
nba,removed,name one piece of legislation so far that you like
nba,removed,name one piece of legislation so far that you like
nba,removed,the cba is like legislation it went through proposals and debate and then needed to be ratified moving the asg from charlotte was an executive order imagining if the commissioner decided unilaterally which like most executive orders dont happen in a vacuum now just compare that to us politics and i think i kept it on topic enough
nba,removed,got it thank you for the clarification
nba,removed,the us is no longer in the transpacific partnership for one whatever your opinion of trump thats a damn good thing
nba,removed,i thought we were building a wall with memes
nba,removed,well see a lot of that over the next few years be aware of what is sourced and what isnt trump is someone whos reports of literally anything sound plausible
nba,removed,that is a thing of beauty i love how trump brings people together
nba,removed,months
nba,removed,years is months
nba,removed,my body is ready
nba,removed,yeah thank you i was actually not fully serious that it was only the refs but they definitely pissed me of that game and had a big impact on the game
nba,removed,pg hit roy hibberts girl causing him to leave then they deserve support
nba,removed,seems like hes having a good night
nba,removed,reddit has always hated the tpp no way hes gonna get downvoted
nba,removed,man i think sully voted for trump and wants to build that mexican wall what with all the bricks hes been producing
nba,removed,and ill let you know that my memes are tremendous just some of the best
nba,removed,they misspoke when saying legislation but youre just straight up an idiot if you think this stuff is meaningless or innocuous
nba,removed,lol what there isnt a single subreddit outside of badeconomics where the tpp is defended
nba,removed,nba coaches roasting trump and his crew is my new favorite trend in sports
nba,removed,i had the same thought as well people were worried they would let trump say whatever he wanted in office but its clear thats not the case
nba,removed,this officiating thanks trump
nba,removed,he got tripped you dildo
nba,removed,paging donald trump come get your gina
nba,removed,not sure if alternativefacts or trump supporter
nba,removed,how is that not a flagrant but greens was weeks ago
nba,removed,were all going to have to get used to the fact that trump is a national embarrassment and this is going to get pointed out anywhere and everywhere outside of trump supporters pretty much everyone over the world hates him we brought this shit on ourselves
nba,removed,executive orders do not fall under legislation eos are legally binding but their scope is limited to the powers of the executive branch only whereas federal legislation is crafted by congress and applies to the entire country basically congressional legislation sets laws the government has to follow and eos can be used to direct executive agencies on how they go about doing so
nba,removed,it doesnt fucking matter what record our team had we werent coming back with that same team which is why we had all that cap space
nba,removed,lol that suit fit
nba,removed,well i support it as well im just saying i didnt see outside of be
nba,removed,great catch i didnt see tuesdays episode because of something trump related being played on cbs but i knew i was missing something with
nba,removed,game
nba,removed,dark lands for most of us are where kek is used without sarcasm its cringy as fuck
nba,removed,lebron needs to stop going our president kek and meme magic got him a championship it can as easily take it away
nba,removed,as long as trump doesnt kill the internet
nba,removed,just wait if trump gets his way we might
nba,removed,the libtards dont listen to facts i was at the inauguration too it was all bullshit what cnn reported
nba,removed,also white boy needs to know his placeits hardens team
nba,removed,because then you wouldnt know that trump blocked the tpp and greenlit construction on the border wall
nba,removed,also not true congress has been in session since january
nba,removed,how about you man the fuck up and just put some of the blame on him and some of it on everyone else why you gotta be lazy and like a woman and blame everything on one person or thing
nba,removed,fuck this shit fuck it all fuck our franchise cousins fuck trump and fuck the environment
nba,removed,i went to a meeting on my campus about this and the speaker was convinced that trump will be just as if not more aggressive with russia than the left but im with you putin smiling and popping champagne on the news with trumps election doesnt seem like a smiling sign for us
nba,removed,youd think trump would be all for it the evidence is there in colorado theyll rake in taxes and they can use that for campaigns against drug use just like colorado where the youth usage is decreasing it would probably eliminate some drug violence too and no lacing weed and youre not gonna get rolled by a drug dealer so it makes the citizens safer also please someone explain why it hasnt happened already
nba,removed,now all we need is trump to do it
nba,removed,most people had her around to trumps holy shit the meme keeps on giving
nba,removed,cavs flair we fired him with a partially guaranteed year left on his contract then he got fired at the start of his season of a year contract with the lakers and then the cavs hired him back for years and fired him at the start of his season paying him for years that time around that would be like trump getting impeached successfully running for governor of new york and getting kicked out of office in a different scandal then getting elected president again while under investigation
nba,removed,its political posts but of them are antitrump
nba,removed,thats not good news paul ryan is among the sane republicans in the house of representatives despite being crazy if ryan loses that means the crazier ones have won
nba,removed,to be fair trump was tweeting rare pepes the only non rfellowkids candidate was bernie who understands that we only meme because we cant afford healthcare or education
nba,removed,i know youre joking but calling a tall black man trump is borderline racial slur
nba,removed,youre making excuses for him by trying to compare his decision to lebrons its not even close also you can keep waiting for an answer to your first question because its irrelevant the win roster was gone as soon as our offseason started
nba,removed,and that is why trump will continue to get away with his insanity by being so ridiculous the only way we can cope is by making it humorous we bitch and moan for a few days and then start quoting his schtick like its a joke and on and on
nba,removed,trump got the majority of college educated white women the military voters the financially well off people he didnt get the poverty vote or the minority vote actually the liberal vote comes from people in poverty and minorities who need food stamps welfare checks for kids government housing etc i realize there are a lot of millenials with no life experience in this sub but trump supporters have more common sense and do better in life than the liberals begging for hillary and bernie to give them at mcdonalds if the rnba mods are going to ban political threads but allow hundreds of comment threads in every thread to be antitrump then im going to voice my own fucking opinion as well
nba,removed,had her winning chances around and trump around so really she had a lead although that princeton dude said
nba,removed,quick someone get trump to dab
nba,removed,fuck you
nba,removed,yes one bitch is worse than the other lebron couldnt get past the super team celtics nor dwights magic despite the stats he put up not his fault he was carrying scrubs thats why he left kd left a championship caliber team where he was partnered with another top player proceeded to leave to a historic team that they couldveshouldve beaten not comparable even in the slightest if lebrons team was talented enough to go up on the celticsmagic back then hes not losing the series so yes one is significantly worse the thunder were good enough and kd left the cavs werent good enough when the ws really mattered so he left keep sucking tho
nba,removed,shut the fuck up
nba,removed,lot of bernie idiots voted him to spite clinton i understand you want a dc that responds to the people but trump aint the answer and many are now realizing that the one great thing about trump is that hes a huge wakeup call for a lot of people
nba,removed,when mexico sends its memes theyre not sending their best theyre rapists theyre criminals and some i assume are good memes
nba,removed,only the fastest strongest and most intelligent pepes will be able to escape
nba,removed,not true obamas crowd was bigger than trumps its a fact but it isnt a big deal at all no one would even be talking about if trump and his boyz werent so insecure about it
nba,removed,nope the person that took it confirmed it to be taken at i believe
nba,removed,it should have gotten removed half of this comment thread is talking about trump and hillary nice to see your full politics ban lasted for all of days mods
nba,removed,hadnt heard of that but sure im not commenting on it in favour of trump by any means the main thing i notice is that if you are a democrat voter in a red state or a republican in california your vote is essentially worthless so as if many of them would even bother i dont think abolishing the electoral college is the right idea from an outsiders perspective i feel it does help the states that arent huge in terms of population which is important but i dunno maybe they could adjust it somewhat it is pretty unusual for someone to win it without the popular vote though anyway
nba,removed,for anyone that doesnt know liberty us president took an extremely pro trump stance before the election
nba,removed,youre celebrating a prehistoric moment topkek holiday
nba,removed,first off this is a political post and its not taken down for some reason secondly the media reported that trump stood no chance at winning the election the alternative facts are that he won but lets all pretend they havent been trashing him and lying about him for months and months and everything the ad revenue driven media says is true
nba,removed,i agree its not an ideal system but the damage is crazy high trump has convinced millions of people that voting is rigged that illegal immigrants are the reason they dont have jobs its going to be an insane years
nba,removed,lol youre the ones who get triggered and run away back to your safe space when your dear leader gets criticized you think were crying but were really laughing at you and i think you know that deep down also the salt you all claim to be tasting its trumps cum
nba,removed,sean spicer trumps press secretary was telling lies at a press conference kellyanne conway said in an interview that they werent lies but alternative facts also sean spicer also said sometimes we can disagree with facts
nba,removed,i think that they see all of the politicians not fulfilling their promises stories and it lets them assume that trump will be more the same theyre now learning that politicians mostly do fulfill their promises and they now have to live with them just remember to not mock them weve all had moments of thinking that politicians just lie
nba,removed,trump is the greatest thing to happen to politics
nba,removed,i mean i feel it seemed like around the time of the sexual assault video i feel the fact that hillary was the last thing in the news cycle and if hillary was in the news cycle it was always negative as positive news isnt profitable only negative stands a chance against trump whos a walking contraversity is what made it possible for her to lose in the absurd manner she did key states by razor thin margins as the way undecided voters broke so makes you wonder if they were actually undecided
nba,removed,very well put preach my man a parallel to a us govt can be drawn here with the new administration where you have trump clearing the way for the pipeline freezing the epa taking funding away from planned parenthood the aca building a wall etc sure you might save some money in the budget or create some jobs but its at the cost of humanity and the environment mind me asking what kind of nonprofit you run
nba,removed,hillary lebron and trump manu ginobili
nba,removed,donald trump tweets started appearing on my feed i was confused for a minute and then remembered he took over potus
nba,removed,yes because the context would be basketball games against wildly differing talent levels for which there are hundreds of past examples but weve only had presidential elections and far fewer at that where the media looked anything like it currently does while it was perfectly fine to say that hillary was leading polling data pointed to that it was inappropriate to say that she stood such a large chance of winning when we only had so many past points you could point your predictions towards even if you look at past examples with more data points say senatorial elections youd expect someone down by as much as trump was to win far more than of the time this happened this election for instance when fiengold was defeated in his attempt to regain the wisconsin senate seat tldr humans underestimate the odds of events that are unlikely to happen
nba,removed,i also pointed out this reddit and many other subreddits not just elites its constant trump and conservative bashing i love conversation but it seems on here you cant have a differing opinion i would enjoy politics being out of sports all together i come here to see highlights and read nba talk not bashing of conservatives
nba,removed,gordon should do a dunk where he posterizes a kdlookalike and yell lil nigga
nba,removed,i trust the process joel is the man but here is where alternative facts come in everyone believed hands up dont shoot but the alternatives facts were that it was a lie we come to find out that it in fact was a lie but no one mocks that what kellyanne said wasnt entirely false did trump have the crowd sizes obama did no but did he have more viewership arguably sotv worldwide streaming i think its a stupid thing to discuss but alternative facts is the same thing as saying spinning the facts which we all know everyone does on both sides im just here to defend one side and also say that i love the separation between sports and state
nba,removed,its not that bad ive seen way worse yall are just a bunch of softies bruh
nba,removed,its refreshing to see the coaches of the league taking shots at trump lol
nba,removed,punk ass snitchangelo bruh come to my crib bruh i promise we aint playing around bruh talkin shit about my area is gonna get yo ass schmacked bruh dangelo lil snitch ass lil bitch ass lil eyebrow ass wannabe celeb ass lil raccoon lookin ass with your eyebrow slits bruh u think u tough or something
nba,removed,what oh right americans you people dont go outside
nba,removed,alternatively it was a journey and a half and i dunno how balmer feels about trump
nba,removed,i think a better parallel is if hillary hadnt labeled trumps voters as deplorables and actually reached out to them she couldve gotten the needed support just like if draymond had kept his composure and hadnt acted like an idiot gsw couldve taken it all the way as well both basically shot themselves in the foot one by hubris one by a very bad temper
nba,removed,i think he is right to scrutinize if hes carrying his team on his back what people see and what happens not the court determines who the goat is not what happens off court
nba,removed,its like you dont even want to read what i actually wrote let me put it this way trump has the lowest job approval rating of any incoming president ever the result of the election turned into the most people dissatisfied at this point in a presidency of all time that is something unique to this election that shows the people were not served during this cycle and something different needs to happen for the next one so the results dont stay the same
nba,removed,ur a fucking retard if you cant acknowledge the drive and work ethic it takes to maintain the athleticism he has at this age
nba,removed,you probably predicted that trump wouldnt win republican candadicy then probably there is no way hell even get of the vote then lastly you probably thought that there is no way he would beat hillary now you think he wont even last term keep being wrong my friend youre only gonna keep getting proved wrong
nba,removed,what i was copying your previous comment where you asked a string of questions my point is this you act as if we had a more politically informed society trump wouldnt be president which is basically denigrating millions of americans and calling them stupid but lets not get into that you bring up statistics to indicate that people generally werent into politics but whos to say that those people wouldnt have supported trump as well
nba,removed,alternatively it was a journey and a half and i dunno how balmer feels about trump
nba,removed,do you even stats bro click the article read the unbias stats then come delete your post tbh
nba,removed,
nba,removed,this is vinsane sô the answer too much swag

nba,removed,why are you even here did you guys get linked you clearly dont care about basketball do you just have an alert set that notifies you anytime trump is mentioned on reddit
nba,removed,trump absolutely blown into oblivion
nba,removed,exactly if they were and id be wary the fact is hes now a point guard he need to be down there anyway point guards jobs are to take the ball up if he gets the rebound their offense gets set that much faster its a credit to their coach and knowing what works for the team russell is worlds better now than he was when kd was there btw its statistical analysis statistically is an adverb
nba,removed,i stopped reading at if lbj wanted depth at every position its impossible to do with a hard cap space unless he takes a paycut there is no fucking hard cap in the nba and if lbj played for free theyd havewait for itzero fucking cap space so if you dont know this youre talking out of your ass and the rest has no value whatsoever step inform step opine
nba,removed,the trump team was letting in literally anybody so they could fill seats i mean they
nba,removed,this guy is a warriors fan look at his post historyjust saying

nba,removed,rnba doesnt watch the thunder enough to understand this and just look at stats like its the end all be all
nba,removed,why did the comments suggesting rgiss get deleted but outside of him id pressure to do it
nba,removed,what usually happens to open these positions do people not get their stuff in on time and get booted or do people quit mid season

nba,removed,trump needs to send the feds into the bulls locker room
nba,removed,
nba,removed,ha theyve already back tracked on itbut it was this
nba,removed,korver is terrible and having the worst year of his career by far important to note tho this trade opened up a roster spot which depending upon the buyout class could mean a player as good as deron williams etc
nba,removed,the wh said a couple hours back that the way mexico would pay for the wall would be to add a tax on mexican imports this would increase the prices of goods coming from mexico its a lot and would hurt american consumers for no good reason there was a massive uproar and the wh has already retracted the comments surely a lot of congressmen got bombarded with callsemails about it and told the white house to stop with that stupid talk
nba,removed,celtic fans love white players
nba,removed,his on air orgasm when iverson hit a game winner against germany in some international tourney is up there his quote not sure if in game on the superiority of basketball to football and baseball is also one of the great things ever said
nba,removed,westbrook gets snubbed again
nba,removed,lmao i was just saying in regards to this thread thats what it looks like i dont think what he said was that bad either also go fuck yourself
nba,removed,the asg in the nba is the most unwatchable asg of the major sports the pro bowl is more watchable than the nba asg also they would have to play an extra quarter if they plan on adding roster spots
nba,removed,guessing your guy didnt make it

nba,removed,walkinginonit points years ago it should be noted that ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as i know that said in grade i took an sat test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area an iq test has shown me to be in the percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test my mothers boyfriend of years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of i understand physics better than him and i owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics hes not particularly successful as an engineer but ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it im also pretty good at engineering i dont have a degree and other than physics i dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy ive come across every question of existentialism which ive seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is psychology i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which i dont have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freuds theories im a good enough writer that im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the internet ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it i dont know if that will suffice as evidence that im intelligent im done with it though because id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii i would be against executing him in fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it id even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them i dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others i dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others but i dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them i dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc i know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things i love everyone even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone im pretty much a pacifist ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that the only time ill fight back is if the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and if i dont attack ill come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me i dont fight back ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that im never in a situation where ill be worse off after a fight if im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries i really dont care the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them id prefer to do that over killing them i consider myself a feminist i dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men and never participate in the old reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome that doesnt mean i look for places to victimize women i just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings ok when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that im kind of tired of citing these examples and im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far in closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the reddit brony community where i spend most of my time and where im pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so i guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments

for it at all it was spurofthemoment i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area an iq test has shown me to be in the percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that

nba,removed,id venture a guess that you dont go around telling people to fuck their mothers when you dont have a screen to hide behind or that if you do the majority of people let it go because youre fifteen years old if everything youve said is true you might be an intelligent individual if you think that grants you worth or makes your opinion valuable to anybody but you youre wrong being fifteen means youve never had to take care of yourself youve presumably never known the fear loneliness and pain of addiction i sincerely hope that you never do everything in your life right now you can afford to take for granted because you dont actually have to work for anything its handed to you so here you go attempting to prove how smart you are to a stranger on the internet because suddenly just being you isnt enough to impress while i could do a pointbypoint analysis of why your selfaggrandizing diatribe is meaningless to everyone but you it would essentially feed your ego further to dissect your message which was the whole purpose of writing it out in the first place your iq proves nothing your bronyism proves less than that your selfreported physics knowledge is likely bullshit but also useless in forming human relationships being a dick on the internet is easy actually being thoughtful considering other people before you say things and being willing to admit wrongdoing or at least try to examine a perspective besides your own thats a task but you can get away with just being a dick and it feeds your sense of superiority which clearly you possess by the nature of your defense because you cant defeat irrational insults with rational responses so what do i think of you again if what you said is true youre an intelligent person sure but i think your casual willingness to be meanspirited to people you dont know who are gathering in a virtual space to discuss things that are important to them outweighs whatever intelligence you have and makes you an unpleasant person to interact with it would do you well to consider others and also entertain the notion that you are not better than other people complaining that you are downvoted when your advice the pedestal you built for yourself is irrelevant to the thread you comment in then being an outright asshole when someone explains that downvote which didnt need to be explained at all is confrontational at best but in reality its just dickishness which no one can prevent but its not something people have to put up with either i feel like ive just wasted my time because i think you are more interested in defending yourself than examining and discussing

nba,removed,is this a joke dont is a contraction of two words do not so this reads as she do not believe in shooting stars then it goes on to say but she do believe in strangely missing from this phrase is the auxillary verb does which fixes the grammar to read but she does believe in honest question and downvote me all you want i think kanye is a cultural abomination a nonartist no talent and i really question why so many african americans and others purposefully try to sound ignorant with the way that they speak why would you ever willingly choose to sound uneducated and why would you ever accept the mental chains of slavery that say only white folk speak correct proper english if you ever wondered why white people think you sound ghetto this is part of the reason its like you are trying hard on purpose to speak ebonics and its completely cringeworthy why not listen to actual rolemodels in the african american community like dr ben carson neurosurgeon he speaks like an educated person and is not tied down to the oppressive cultural slavery that is the toxic rap culture wake up stop oppressing yourselves stop worshipping money do something with your life that is a real contribution to society besides being another cookiecutter aggressive violent pantssagging tribalistic juju thrower stop treating women poorly and glorifying it in your music and culture just like we all know kanye is insane with the way he treats kim honestly just looking at kanyes face how his mouth is always hanging open mouth breathing combined with his completely insane overblown ego the blasphemous things he says about himself in regards to gd idolizing himself he is the very epitome of sin time to find some new role models and change your ways black people all you do is kill eachother in your communities then you try to get mad at white people fact is that white people are much more likely to get killed having an interaction with the police than are blacks stop victim blaming everyone but yourselves all lives matter take your racism and your hatred and turn that energy into something actually positive for yourselves instead of constantly just tearing everything down try building things like the white man and you will start having some more respect pretty fucking hilarious that kanye is so elitist and oblivious and out of touch constantly surrounded with people who tell him he is yeezus blasphemy that he actually believes that nonsense he started this disgusting horrible uninspired clothing line but he is the greatest artist ever guys better than michelangelo who painted the sistine chapel and a better poet than john milton and when nobody liked the trash he designed literally trash clothes he tried asking that jew zyklonberg for money so that he could keep trying to make more clothes no doubt in kanyes sick mind he thinks the white man owes him reparations money this guy is a complete cad and anyone who listens to follows imitates respects or cares about anything related to kanye and his disgusting whore of wife are just part of the social cancer that is destroying the fabric of this country

nba,removed,how is this hate its all just facts words arent just black and fucking white you can say critical things and not be a hater for fucks sake
nba,removed,it is stupid that the conferences are so unbalanced there is no reason to have conferences anymore it should be top teams by record seeded
nba,removed,so you think the warriors were lucky lst year but dont think the cavs were lucky this year ok
nba,removed,thats not good logic at all fatigue injuries wear and tear all play huge factors i guess i probably shouldnt be bringing up the intricacies of basketball on this sub tho given how knowledgable the average user is
nba,removed,big badass knows how to curse its definitely a fact that the cavs cakewalked to the finals and are lucky that the conferences havent been abolished yet
nba,removed,lol you think thats a clever rebuttal but it doesnt mean shit
nba,removed,oh my god this shit was bizarre this guy posts that he was friends with steph curry irl posting proof that he was a college player fake texts and even pretended to be people that were in pictures with steph pretending to be the person with a face blurred out after a while of posting he then got called out on his shit automod killed my last response bc of no np link
nba,removed,awww cry
nba,removed,you seem to have a problem with me ever since last year why dont you just ignore me instead of trying to start crap everytime i was just looking for an explanation

nba,removed,the more i go thru the comments the more i am surprised by the amount of toxicity here look guys you dont have to be so worked up on what pop has said that he should stick to coaching that he wins thats why he can say this stuff that hes no humanitarian hes not trying to change your mind or tell you what to do he is speaking his mind just as each of us is entitled and supposed to do its just a lot of people has found it to be very inspiring people who have tough things going on in their lives people who are diehard sports fans bandwagon fans casual fans pretty much your average guy or any extreme person just chill but its great having this conversation to stir the pot
nba,removed,boys boys boys lets settle down
nba,removed,to be honest i didnt even read your comment i just saw the flair and the number of downvotes and figured you were being an asshat and downvoted
nba,removed,one could say youre being too sensitive
nba,removed,how old are you
nba,removed,saaaalt
nba,removed,i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about harden u wouldnt say this shit to him at lan hes jacked not only that but he wears the freshest clothes eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes yall are pathetic lol
nba,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
nba,removed,clipsspursrockets should all have an enforcer start blatantly kicking their leg up on rebounds but not hit anyone just to store as evidence then if you meet dray in the wcf just have that same guy rock dray in the head so hard he has to sit the series ohmygosh i love that idea so much just rebound high kick every time
nba,removed,elite
nba,removed,from the nba rule book rule section xiii article d if a player with the ball in his possession raises his pivot foot off the floor he must pass or shoot before his pivot foot returns to the floor common misconception but you are allowed to raise your pivot foot so murrays play was legitimate because he shot before it came down
nba,removed,i hope the pacers break klays legs this is an insult to the entire organization
nba,removed,see than dont respond on a public forum especially when it expresses my own thoughts jesus christ are you damaged somewhere
nba,removed,this is absolutely hilarious so wait a second my point was that i let me reiterate i not eye but i wanted klay to score so you come out of no where and utter some bullshit and use his father as evidence on why i shouldnt believe a certain thing are you retarded if you dont give a shit about what i say dont respond bro jesus christ you obviously care too much

nba,removed,you realise half those injuries are them leaving people out so the team will perform worse the sixers did it with embiid

nba,removed,hes a bitch and bitches get no mvp votes
nba,removed,sacrifice no bricks
nba,removed,hardens natural shooting motion involves swooping his arms under opponents and drawing bs fouls
nba,removed,do you guys think if the warriors lose klay will walk off the court like a weeny again
nba,removed,rockets are trash
nba,removed,this is gonna be one hell of a quarter collapse by harden
nba,removed,didnt that movie end badly for them
nba,removed,whos taht cocksucker yelling into the mic
nba,removed,
nba,removed,dont let this win distract you from the fact that the us just sworn in a twitter troll as president
nba,removed,and lakers are undefeated in the trump presidency
nba,removed,really because i was thinking i cant believe donald trump is the fucking president now
nba,removed,this is trumps america
nba,removed,if he hasnt already i think ingrams about to outgrow the role he was given to start the season hes good enough to be more than the or option on offense and i think his minutes with lou have to go down as much as possible also notice how the highlights end with the quarter in the he basically stood around while lou jc and jules basically took turns jacking up shots that was kind of maddening
nba,removed,lmaoo 😂😂
nba,removed,fuck him trash president all empty promises and killing innocents with drones that is his legacy should be tried for war crimes
nba,removed,im surprised people dont find his behavior more childish and primadonna like such as spitting water out in the pregame trying to game the allstart system and my hunch that hes behind the scenes trying to push jah out in favor of noel and why jah has been getting so many dnps lately lmao shut up
nba,removed,hes hit trump with the briefcase lillian garcia ladies and gentleman barack obama is cashing in his money in the bank contract for a term as potus
nba,removed,trump sworn in to office with a game winner this has been a great day

nba,removed,this is so fuckin stupid and do you have any basis or source for that pushing out jah claim other then your ass which seems to heavily biased in the first place fuck outta here
nba,removed,trump will drop a nuke there so please go
nba,removed,literally everyone flops go fuck yourself
nba,removed,no one asked you masshole
nba,removed,just like they gave trump
nba,removed,i dont know anything about rj but i trust him over marco rubio
nba,removed,them there trump logic all you left out was sad
nba,removed,are you saying trump would have run a more nationally appealing campaign strategy if so this is possible they definitely played it to perfection in terms of doing juuuuust enough in those midwestern states to win by a few hundred thousand total votes there the strategy was brilliant in that regard
nba,removed,marco rubio has a bad jumper doesnt rebound and doesnt distribute the ball well
nba,removed,to be fair most of the posts here bring nothing to basketball discussion lololol lead
nba,removed,when marco rubio plays he sets the difficulty to rookie and changes the sliders
nba,removed,fine marco rubio doesnt have a left lacks leadership but isnt a veteran either his failure to rebound against trumps hectic offense was underwhelming and he doesnt know much about any other positions better
nba,removed,well if its alright with you im going to stop having a pedantic argument over how much sports disappointment ive had to put up with you can walk away feeling like you know better and i can go have a late breakfast
nba,removed,to be fair to this guy he only responded about politics because the other guy commented about rubios politics first
nba,removed,no you were being retarded
nba,removed,its pointless even having a discussion with people like you whatever man believe whatever you want
nba,removed,holy fuck you really are a moron arent you hahahahhahahahahaha
nba,removed,trump isnt competitive
nba,removed,click bait wouldve been your mom
nba,removed,whos better at strategy hinkie or trump

nba,removed,fuck all your players and you too
nba,removed,honestly when someone says something like that it usually means they dont even understand in what theyre sticking up for because i didnt even say it was worthless or why the formula works against itself in some areas while ignoring defense but im sure your understanding is far above everyone elses mr hollinger

nba,removed,why postsecondary obviously increases your eloquence vocabulary and the information you learn lebrons been focused primarily on basketball not public speaking it makes sense he wouldnt be a great public speaker do you have stats to back up why its stupid or were you just offended
nba,removed,im fucking sick of it im sick of going into every thread and seeing countless people telling me to relax because my team is so spooky there is nothing fucking spooky about a team that blows a point lead in the last two minutes there is nothing fucking spooky about a team that is on pace for fewer wins than they had last season with a fucking sam mitchell coached team there is nothing fucking spooky about a team that collapses more than the customers of life alert but i have to go into every fucking single thread in this sub about my team and listen to countless people tell me to calm down because dude youre team is so spooky bra no stfu you dont tell me how to feel my team hasnt made the fucking playoffs since ive heard this rebuilding term thrown around for a fucking decade so dont even talk to me about trusting some goddamn process philly fans im sick of my team when i die i want the timberwolves to lower me into my grave so they can let me down one more time and its fucking right now this goddamn state

nba,removed,it doesnt matter if i think its moral or immoral but for the record i dont think its immoral its trash talk get the fuck over it but let me explain this to you in extremely simple terms my first comment was about the arbitrariness of these supposed ethics morals and lines not whether they exist or not i dont give a shit if you think its moral i dont give a shit if players think its moral that isnt what im arguing that isnt what my point was my point was simply that those lines are arbitrary you clearly want to argue about something else and youre clearly passionate and emotional about it do it somewhere else im tired of your lazy ass failing to read and understand my points
nba,removed,hes clearly been inspired by trump with the inflammatory flagrantly disrespectful reallife trolling
nba,removed,fine its not lebron because hes been on shaqtin more than once and so has the guy hes chasing only kevin durant is enough of a bitch to ask not to be on shaqtin clear enough or do i have to get out the crayons for your stupid ass
nba,removed,i never stated an opinion dan is lauded as an exceptional beat writer and cap expert and you objectively performed both hasty generalization and false equivalency fallacies in your comment not valuing or listening to anothers opinion what youre explicitly doing is a natural defense tactic for people who are incorrect and insecure in the knowledge of their incorrectness
nba,removed,no he wasnt lol
nba,removed,i dont think any route to the finals is easy per say but i will agree that pistons hawks raptors is a lighter playoff route than the warriors had you are right though you cant discount a team that made it there
nba,removed,karma holy fuck kid go outside
nba,removed,mj is in the playoffs without pippen pippen should of won a ring without him in but got sternd the league was not going to allow pippen to win a ring wo mj cuz that would make mj look way more overrated than he already is same thing with kobe playoff series wins wo a legit big man he should also have fmvp but the league couldnt embarrass him that badly gasol deserved both just like they gave him a pity mvp when clearly deserved it over him if the nba was never rigged and scripted mj wouldnt be considered the goat and kobe wouldnt even be considered a top player of all time lbj will finish his career with or rings and have fmvp only in the nba do fans bring up ring count when comparing players well mainly kobe kids cuz they know that is all kobe has over anyone
nba,removed,shitpost and youre full of shit sour grapes even a decade later how about talking about how shitty your team is and how pop raped tie franchise with his sales pitch last summer
nba,removed,the choice is yours
nba,removed,imagine lebrons reaction even if it was a hard dick lebron is sure to exaggerate it hell probably fly into the stands and pretend to be unconscious for minutes draymond green banned for whole series forcing curry to drop on kyriedelly warriors still win in

nba,removed,on offense the three second violation occurs when any player stays in the paint for more than three seconds whether the offensive player is being guarded or not is irrelevant theres no legal way for an offensive player to stay in the paint for more than three seconds unless the basketball isnt currently in the offensive teams frontcourt on defense in order to be legally allowed to stay inside the paint for more than three seconds a defensive player must be closely guarding an offensive player closely guarding is defined as being within an arms reach of an offensive player now this doesnt mean that the three second violation will be called watch any nba game and youre almost guaranteed to see a couple of uncalled three second violations per game its one of those rules that will usually only be called if its particularly flagrant i think most sport fans are somewhat cocky in general however there are a couple unique circumstances about why the joke is a thing the cavaliers had never won a championship before httpsenwikipediaorgwikiclevelandsportscurse the golden state warriors had just finished with a historic record beating the bulls a record many considered almost unbeatable this was a highly anticipated rematch as gsw and the cavs faced each other the previous year however due to injuries the cavs were missing their second and third best players that year golden state in general was incredibly hyped up by the media the okc thunder had just blown a lead against golden state there were a lot of offcourt things going on that stirred the pot so to speak draymond and his nutkicking allegations klay thompson said that lebron probably got his feelings hurt is lebron declining etc all of this added up to a finish that was pretty much an instant classic so of course people will make jokes about it if youre referring to the semicircle that is under the basket thats called the restricted area i dont know if youre familiar with charge and block rules but when a player stand in the restricted area they are ineligible to draw a offensive charge from the player attacking the basket this is to prevent secondary defenders from constantly flopping under the basket sorry i cant answer the last one
nba,removed,lol literally the only fact here is that lebron shot in a finals series of which im pretty sure he shot less than outside the paint the rest is just personal attacks by butt hurt lebron dickriders

nba,removed,the point is games isnt significant to answer your question yes you shouldnt look at stats to compare the two unless you have more to look at
nba,removed,you are a warriors fan of course you think that watching the warriors fast break on only to kick the ball out to the corner for a three is patently bad basketball who needs to run an offense where all you need to do is run around a screen and shoot its boring at least when you watch lebron you are watching one of the best to ever do it a specimen that wont be matched for decades lebron is undeniable when he wants to get down the lane now that analytics have pushed the game outside and rule changes have made defense impossible there will be more stephs

nba,removed,this is incorrect the rule says they have to exist at the same time not happen at the same time if you hit the ball on the way up or at the apex before it hits the board and you only bounce ot off the board its a block if you pin it which he very clearly did obvious in real time it is goaltending this is well known by pretty much every player out there and most certainly by anyone who has refereed above little league its called correctly over of the time they either missed it which is pretty sad considering the stakes or they just gave it to him in a letem play mindset which is even worse

nba,removed,because the literal definition of a word is how words function in a sentence completely out of context in their most elemental formoutside use in a sentence people dont just speak in words we speak in sentences with words next to other words those words take on meaning based on the meaning of the words in the same sentence a word in one sentence might actually take on meaning based on a word in a completely different sentence what you are saying is instead of looking at how that word was used in relation to other words he used we should all just consult a dictionary someone called me a faggot today and i found out it really just means bundle of sticks i felt stupid for feeling like they were trying to hurt me im still confused why i was called a bundle of sticks
nba,removed,definition someone called me a faggot today and i found out it really just means bundle of sticks i felt stupid for feeling like they were trying to hurt my feelings or imply i was a homosexual and therefore not a valuable person im still confused as to why i was called a bundle of sticks ive heard it has something to do with fascism i would be so confused if i didnt look up the word and instead paid attention to how he yelled it and tried to push me into the street i guess bundle of sticks might also mean something bad fascism

nba,removed,in the logic centers of my brain i just find it absurd that this guy isnt held accountable for his shitty actions and behavoir watching this sub rush to ignore cousins outburst as quick as possible is like watching rthedonald rush to upvote some random bullshit to the front page whenever trump does something moronic oh it was leaked that trump is going to pick a literal puppet as the secretary of agriculture um everyone look over hear at this pretty american flag picture then when youre done looking at that click on this article about a cop being shot months ago
nba,removed,my first day watching nba is he the big guy who was the times leader of scoring in the league and mvp i hear he is new in this team right he looked really good at sole play and no wonder fans were all excited when seeing him with the ball

nba,removed,regarding the antikobe bias on this sub we all know about it and we all see it its obvious nobody ever wants to admit it but its there people on this subreddit hate kobe bryant the first question to ask why why do you all hate him the obvious answer you didnt watch him in his prime likely explanation i know that most of you are around or years old that means you only got into basketball in the last couple years so you never watched mamba in his prime and because you didnt watch him in his prime you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores but heres the thing basketball isnt played on excel spreadsheets the moment somebody brings up true shooting percentage or win shares i know they know nothing about basketball kobes game cannot be encapsulated by one stat hes the second greatest sg ever and one of the best players to ever play the game so when i hear somebody say that lebron james is better than kobe bryant i laugh because i know that anybody who watched kobe in his prime wouldnt think that unlike you guys i have watched basketball for a significant amount of time so i know that kobe is better you might be jealous of kobes five rings or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in nba history or whatever unless youre a bulls fan who watched basketball in the or a lakers fan who watched basketball in the you dont know what real coldblooded killer instinct willtowin basketball looks like and theres nothing wrong with that this sub would make you think that kobe isnt even a top player ever so dont go spouting bullshit about players you didnt watch talk about your greats like lebron james the best player in the world™ but leave the kobe talk to the adults fair

nba,removed,youre a clown
nba,removed,dam cant believe is trump is going through with what he said on the campaign i thought it was mostly hyperbole
nba,removed,and your logic about lebron saying shit is to motivate the team is worse than middle school lebron dickriders
nba,removed,and embiid is in large part responsible for making them better you dumbass you have to be either lying to yourself or legitimately stupid what a ridiculous argument lmao embiid doesnt deserve to be in the allstar game because he didnt help an awful team win games in the first quarter of his rookie year so basically youre simultaneously holding embiid to the standard of an allstar for the things he didnt do but not accepting all of the things he does do as worthy of a spot
nba,removed,being a hater is worse than being a fan of a player you haters always love calling out stans without realizing what you do is more pathetic username is irrelevant for you but you still sucking off the warriors all day and hating on lebron wasting even being a stan in my comment lol most normal people know that lebron has been an underdog in the finals damn near every year everyone knows its lebron that makes these superteams keep hating though its all good lebrons well on his way to goat or with jordan nothing you say matters fool
nba,removed,flair up pussy
nba,removed,no because they built a wall around the airport
nba,removed,wrong
nba,removed,trump is a joke
nba,removed,probably got some kind of senior citizens exemption
nba,removed,downvotes arent for disagreeing man why do you downvote the truth you have to know deep down that embiid deserved to be in the all star game
nba,removed,thread of the year potential
nba,removed,agreed mods helped trump get elected sad
nba,removed,this will only last days
nba,removed,mods remove me i dont care but i have to say this
nba,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°╯╲卐卐卐卐 dont mind me just taking thw mods for a walk
nba,removed,its okay hes a warriors fan so he just started liking basketball years ago
nba,removed,people kept saying ermagherd ernie is so wise if he cant look at trump hillary and clearly distinguish between them his judgement is fucked kasich writein incase people werent there
nba,removed,on a sub with half a million subscribers you remove any thread that gets reports either youre lying to us or this is a stupid rule
nba,removed,youre an idiot
nba,removed,this whole thing reeks of bullshit from furher trump
nba,removed,so far its the worst thing he has done he did one good things then like bad things
nba,removed,i cant tell if youre serious or not because anytime politics gets brought up in this sub its like of people saying trump sucks
nba,removed,lol thon remembers nazi germany he knews what he is doing
nba,removed,fuck donald trump
nba,removed,yes we know and its probably getting worse which is terrifying were that country now we have a dictator
nba,removed,wouldnt mind if he fucked off tbh hes annoying af
nba,removed,disliking trump and his policies doesnt disbar you from being republican plenty of republicans feel the same way
nba,removed,only been president for one fucking week and its making me depressed as hell its going to be a long years
nba,removed,lol thanks captain obvious not what i was even close to the point im saying im aware but after tomorrow well have played more road games right now at this point in the year then any other team
nba,removed,trump wont fuck with the nba hed get impeached next time congress is in session
nba,removed,man i feel you i just hate hearing about this shit i know its important and we need to be talking about it but im just so tired of constant negativity
nba,removed,honest question why do you say that im not very involved in politics asside from what i read in here and would like to know why is it wrong to compare trump to a dictator
nba,removed,you dont understand the difference between political and electionrelated im not saying this post is political but your comment is completely illogical
nba,removed,any people in red states maybe wisconsin or texas or some of the smaller ones interested in sending a letter to their representatives i wrote one from a conservative angle but i live in california so its be useless if so lmk i will send u what i wrote and you can send it directly to the congressman of your state
nba,removed,iran is one of the countries that trump has banned entry from and asghar farhadi is an iranian national without us citizenship
nba,removed,i doubt the winner of this years finals even goes to the white house to visit trump
nba,removed,can we impeach this piece of shit already
nba,removed,if you think presidents against the media is the same as the press secretary labeling the media as the opposition party then i dont know what to say im not saying trump and the media have to be friends or that trump has to kowtow but painting the media as the opposition and trying to delegitimize them is a tactic of dictators from the beginning of society
nba,removed,unfortunately dual citizenship doesnt help
nba,removed,talk to the dhs circa because thats where the list of countries came from not trump
nba,removed,idk didnt support either candidates i was really annoyed by those sjw because they kept on acting like idiots on television with the latest ban i do feel trump should be more mature on the muslim ban trump has good intentions but he isnt smart and look at both sides and that is also true with liberals and these trump supporters i hate cnn but it is getting annoying that people have to say everything from them is fake trust me i hate van jones and kayleigh mcnanny becuase they can never understand either side but not every person in cnn is trying to deceive the people this whole election was terribly run by media and reason why trump is president is their fault of sucking his dick like espn does with the warriors
nba,removed,so is this what america is like when its great again
nba,removed,nah australia isnt on trumps shitlist yet
nba,removed,most of our country are rednecks dude the sooner we accept that the sooner this problem will be addressed
nba,removed,dude you cant win with trump supporters or sjws they never see both sides
nba,removed,yep case in point the dallas stars jumbotron operator mocking trumps inauguration crowd size insecurity is by far the most upvoted post in the history of rhockey i had a comment on that post near the top at upvotes and golds explaining the joke to someone and then tearing into him i got at least rthedonald trolls and bots ripping into me and giving me death threats and shit fortunately the mods there removed the lot of those comments the admins seriously need to do something about rthedonald they shouldnt delete the sub entirely censoring freedom of speech is a whole can of worms on its own but you should not be allowed to ban people just for having different opinions or even preemptively banning people that havent even posted there because they support someone else same thing with thing with rtheredpill they are basically the td of relationships obviously there needs to be a crackdown on the downvote bots and troll bots as well as people who attack others for having a legitimate opinion backed by facts
nba,removed,didnt trumps campaign attack hillary for meddling with saudis and now trumps in bed with them
nba,removed,im saying the list of countries didnt come from donald trump it came from congress and the dhs trumps order i hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the united states of aliens from countries referred to in section of the ina usc would be detrimental to the interests of the united states and i hereby suspend entry into the united states as immigrants and nonimmigrants of such persons for days from the date of this order literally just references this bill from a in generalexcept as provided in subparagraphs b and c— i the alien has not been present at any time on or after march — i in iraq or syria ii in a country that is designated by the secretary of state under section of title as continued in effect under the international emergency economic powers act usc et seq section of title section of title or any other provision of law as a country the government of which has repeatedly provided support of acts of international terrorism or iii in any other country or area of concern designated by the secretary of homeland security under subparagraph d in which i is iraq and syria and iii was determined by dhs to be iran sudan yemen libya and somalia
nba,removed,not who we are as a country the country was told this would happen and made its choice during the election
nba,removed,well peoples reactions to it are
nba,removed,im not a trump apologist but isnt the ban against specific countries not muslims so a us resident muslim from indonesia or india or pakistan or egypt could go home and come back without issue no but a us resident christian from iran would be screwed
nba,removed,do you think pops comments on trump and the womens match needed t be removed
nba,removed,shitposts are legit now trumps america in a nutshell
nba,removed,no it wouldnt hes a us citizen if trump denied us citizens entry into the us well id hope that would be enough to impeach him even with a republican congress
nba,removed,i suppose whoever wins the democratic nomination in as long as they can beat trump and deliver universal healthcare or something real early to name a field but maybe someone from gillibrand opposing trump cabinet noms but is a clinton wing type franken warren or maybe a mayor of a big city who opposes trump would seem like reasonable guesses
nba,removed,if youre looking for logic in trumps decisions youre going to be severely disappointed
nba,removed,yeah it sucks how hes making our country safer
nba,removed,youre forgetting that the us needs to be a safe space for trump and his supporters feels reals
nba,removed,yeah because its only trump people who make things ridiculous rpolitics is a bastion of level headed and polite discussion
nba,removed,unsure if its gone through yet but read the other day that trump was going to make australians travel to sydney or canberra and be interviewed by the us embassy before being allowed to come to america
nba,removed,actually its because they hold our nuclear weapons and trump doesnt want to create any animosity with them because of that same goes with saudi arabia and pakistan
nba,removed,not allowing bad people to enter our country
nba,removed,the biggest problem is that trump is continually using executive orders in his first week congress has little control over what trump dors if he continues to push his agenda this way
nba,removed,no thats exactly what you said everyone who disagrees with you is a bot what a pathetic view to have on the world
nba,removed,yeah nixon was really bad but he was still a conventional politician and paid lip service to democracy and rule of law even though he disregarded the latter almost entirely jackson rose to power on the same sort of antiestablishment populism that trump did which is why hes the donalds closest contemporary
nba,removed,this is a rational argument but as a pakistaniamerican with family also american citizens not dual nationals but of pakistani origin currently visiting relatives in pakistan everytime someone says this my heart skips a beat this sets a dangerous precedent many nations automatically give you nationality if you were born there although the us doesnt strip citizenship from dual nationals yet even canada now has laws for this its only a hop skip and jump away to the argument that potentional nationality is as good as actual nationality and then barring people with potential dual nationalities right now at least american nationality is excepted in the current ban and of course its only a short jump from natural born to birthplace of father or grandfather trumps always been amendment hes questioned the citizenship of ted cruz and marco rubio and anyone else whose american parent wasnt their father in his own case his mother was foreign and obviously to people like him the womans origin doesnt matter
nba,removed,there are so many refugee stories that are inspiring thon isnt the only one is a toronto star reporter that pretty much spent all election fact checking trump and pointing out all his lies hes been tweeting out so many stories about refugees today and yesterday its worth a read on his twitter page
nba,removed,shut the fuck up dude
nba,removed,none of the countries that trump has business ties to which coincidentally account for all terrorists are on the ban list so the motivations are pretty transparent fuck brown people unless they make me money
nba,removed,i have never been more ashamed to be an american in my life this goes against everything we stand for as a people god help us all
nba,removed,the funny thing is that this is what trumpies honestly believe your country is a mess and trump isnt gonna make it better the only good thing ive seen him do is end tpp and that has nowhere near made up for the fact that he has bragged about sexually assaulting women among other things i dont care if you stay in your own little bubble of delusion but dont try and spread your cancerous ideology onto me or anyone on this sub fuck off back to rtheadolf
nba,removed,and black lives matter
nba,removed,trump couldnt have won if we werent already fucked

nba,removed,yeah i dont disagree that mods should be deleting spoilers from the threads but chances are youll probably see one before a mod deletes it no reason to restrict who can use the game thread for such a simple matter your analogy is absolutely absurd youre required to go to school youre not required to access a game thread on rnba
nba,removed,sorry i thought this was a basketball sub not a safe space for mildly inconvenienced fans
nba,removed,lol rickon dies and ramsay is prisoner

nba,removed,hes been mediocre throughout the playoffs everybody can see that when playoff level defense kicks in currys numbers effectiveness fall but gs are just a great great team with deep bench green is definitely the key player for the warriors not the best but the most important

nba,removed,bruh the bulls arent the sonics they might be eager to trade butler but they arent going to sell him for of his value like the desperate seattle leadership did not enough hippy hipsters here to force the force the move if the bulls trade butler it will be for more than lavine and the pick it would be for way more than that dont go crying on me now minimum wage weed and no basketball team doesnt that shithole portland have all that and a basketball team even their hippy hipsters werent stupid enough to run their team out of town take it easy on the dabs there bud
nba,removed,lol fuck you too lebron is an entitled whiny bitch and it is not hard to find examples if you werent busy sucking him off dont act like lebron doesnt whine about calls a majority of the time you stupid twat you are hating klay for similar reasons to hate lebron so who is the real idiot
nba,removed,oh yea im really worried about what everyone on reddit thinks of my intelligence while lebrons dick is still in your mouth making you think he never whines and has done no wrong you think he gives credit after losses just like when he left ecf wo shaking hands because its hard for me to congratulate somebody after you just lose to them nice arguments bro but maybe you should just take the high road with your idol james because your homerism is definitly showing next time you should try spitting so you dont get any more of his entitlement down your throat
nba,removed,love to boston
nba,removed,ledecline almost cost the cavs that game
nba,removed,rnba is especially quiet this morning weird
nba,removed,dedeat never forget
nba,removed,i had trouble falling asleep and waking up this morning im to invested in wanting lebron to lose lol
nba,removed,im excited for the massive narrative swing over the next few days s is kyrie better than steph is steph the third best warriors player
nba,removed,lebron james is a good basketball player
nba,removed,this sub needs to examine the fuck out of itself the flip flop between bashing dubs and cavs is obnoxious and has ruined discussion
nba,removed,ok gs fans you have till sunday when were back in oracle for game can you please step your sign game up that shit was embarrassing thanks
nba,removed,i want this to go to just so we can hear the epic booing of adam silver by the oracle crowd
nba,removed,how come you guys didnt just have a different player go after guys nuts
nba,removed,im here to overreact
nba,removed,if i were the cavs and won the series id tell verajo we lost his ring in the mail
nba,removed,with bogut out draymond is gonna have to step up and set all the illegal screens
nba,removed,this series brought to you by ihop flipping naratives like pancakes who do we hate today and what will we change our minds about next
nba,removed,how fucking stupid are you
nba,removed,i would like to thank the warriors for allowing the cavs the chance to make the greatest comeback of all time
nba,removed,i may be off base here but i think you might not like klay
nba,removed,okay which one of yall has been editing
nba,removed,legoat leading both teams again in points rebounds assists steals and blocks how people to still hate on the best player since jordan is honestly mind boggling
nba,removed,id say he right there he needs to get some endorsements to put him over that bar cause now that hes worked on his handle and will put the ball on the floor and drive to the basket that has taken his game to a superstar level id say
nba,removed,the real losers people who paid for courtside seats to watch the warriors win a title
nba,removed,
nba,removed,draymond deserved to be suspended
nba,removed,
nba,removed,lebron is going to bait draymond late in
nba,removed,you lakers fan warriors dickriders are pathetic just change your flair already
nba,removed,lebron nodded
nba,removed,lebron threw him to the ground and then stepped over him they should have banned lebron from basketball forever if they were going to suspend draymond for that
nba,removed,as they should
nba,removed,you dont give up a talent like jimmy without getting a huge haul in return
nba,removed,the nba is definitely less physical the nfl is physical in bursts this is irrelevant dirty players and penalties exist regardless you seem to think the nhl being psychical means they have to fight a single violation in comparison to multiple violations in a single game is the difference between effective penalties and noneffective what so now other sports only have guys committing penalty a game no bad blood builds up how about hockey anywhere other than the nhl stop it there is truth to fights being necessary unless you think nhl players are just unable to control themselves in comparison to other leagues they could be banned tomorrow with the only detriment being fans missing them
nba,removed,dont worry my man lebron has enough time for all of his children including the raptors little bitches

nba,removed,cause when you sign a billion dollar nike deal your hair is of great concern to you
nba,removed,actual numbers need context dont be an idiot is points in triple overtime and minutes played more impressive than points in regulation in minutes played because history says one number is higher
nba,removed,its the singular they genius
nba,removed,i will continue to shit on houston because one day they will suck again
nba,removed,i was at the same bar as dunleavy on union st in sf when he played for the warriors years ago at the end of the night he was sitting on the curb like a doofus waiting for a ride while i went home with a girl thats all i got i guess the point is mike dunleavy is the one guy in the nba that i feel like im way cooler than
nba,removed,why would we be salty raptors fans have had a weird thing about the celtics this year

nba,removed,lol curry western player of the week everyone still riding currys dick this season
nba,removed,ecf and finals but how you interpreted my comment to mean that is completely beyond me
nba,removed,holy fuck theres a lot of lebron dickriders on this sub
nba,removed,
nba,removed,peja stojakovich also what a stupid topic op fuckin offseason bullshit
nba,removed,every game my hands are hot
nba,removed,no its not he deleted the tweet and it means he wants to ignore his stint in orlando ever happened
nba,removed,sad
nba,removed,yeah true racists dont watch black dominated sports they watch tractor pulls and shit ahhh but inherent racism is always the correct answer
nba,removed,yeah actually this random dude was calling kanye a n on his public profile which showed that he worked a pretty big business in the area i was mostly reacting to the kanye disparagments seems like every idiot who knows nothing about music appreiciationcreation hate kanye the shock of the new i guess but when a poc also commented purely talking about the music of kanye still he doubled down on his racist rhetoric so fuck him this is like a year old dude calling respectful people a slur that motherfucker lost his job real quick
nba,removed,youre confusing racism with culturalism racism is purely the belief that certain races are inferior or superior to others theres of course minutiae and nuance to it but if you have an issue with a culture it isnt automatically racism there have been rashes of criminality in pro sports and though it often aligns itself along racial lines its not a racial issue its a cultural one the culture in poor neighborhood leads to bad decision making its not bred into anyone its only when someone makes the connection from a negative trait to a persons race that they are racist thats what really demeans the racial discussion labelling everything racist
nba,removed,i fucked your mom three times and finished the job in her ass
nba,removed,ugh
nba,removed,kd isnt a bad guy he just got caught up in the allure of an easy championship and sort of underestimated how heavily hed be vilified by neutral fans he thought he could spin it as a narrative of personal growth moving on career evolution etc he was wrong at least for awhile the narrative will be that hes a coward if kd was on rnba i bet hed just want to tell us all hes sorry
nba,removed,how is this even an argument yea in addition to all the money he already gives charity he got espn to give even more to charity way to shit on something good sports fans are fucking retarded
nba,removed,yeah but your not taking into account this team would not be staying together this was the only time durant could sign with the warriors he has a chance at years of being a contender vs year of staying with okc no way westbrook was staying this was his only chance to get out and get to play with great like minded players
nba,removed,die in a fire pls
nba,removed,yea and thats what he did the only people who are humiliated are entitled oversensitive manchilds oh no hes telling you hes going to miami the humiliation the shame grow the fuck up
nba,removed,there wont be asterisks on anybodys wins ever why because people gloss over the hows and only look at results how much do you remember of games years ago
nba,removed,neither since both were scripted but if you are talking about from a casual fans pov then ray allens just cuz they were down with seconds left also allens was way more suspenseful than irvings gs didnt score in like the final mins of game and since cleveland was garbage they were struggling to score as well gs knew the script was to lose so they laid down and elected to not score in the final mins and it took cleveland mins to finally score
nba,removed,this all makes a lot of sense
nba,removed,cleveland fan brah look at my username
nba,removed,no ones hating on chasing championships were hating on chasing a championship in your prime by leaving the second best team in the conference to go to the first best team how do you not get that
nba,removed,barkley literally called this a weak move by durant not sure why youre saying barkley regrets not leaving sooner
nba,removed,yeesh sorry we disagree man i dont like gsw i dont like steph well clearly you have an ulterior motive if youre going to post a flaming heap of bullshit like this id hash this out with you but you seem more interested in throwing a tantrum than discussing basketball on a basketball forum i gave my points all youre doing is pussying out on an argument you know youre wrong in
nba,removed,lmao when young is done slathering that cock tell him i need him over here
nba,removed,well then ill be the first to call you an idiot for thinking that these two situations are identical if youre going to make such extremely stupid and irrelevant posts like this youre going to be called an idiot eventually sorry youre butthurt that youre wrong and that your ulterior motives failed with this post i never even would have mentally made it but for chucks comments insinuating a superstar has an obligation to turn down superteams and be the alpha of his own squad when you make comments such as i am worth more than an shoe athlete and you were an mvp then you are bringing it upon yourself to be the alpha of your squad also his greatness is diminished if he in fact wants to be the secondary guy and not the main focus so yes if he wants this status then he is obliged to turn down super teams and stay at the helm of okc
nba,removed,youre an idiot we are better than last year and now in better positon to actually land someone like westbrook next season
nba,removed,yeah i was a bit calmer when i wrote that then i read more details about how things went down
nba,removed,great idea asshole httpiimgurcomnnzpkwypng
nba,removed,lol fuck this bitch why didnt you say that after the finals why say that now when your husbands team just got kd gtfoh

nba,removed,you sound like a bitch thats why no one wants to talk to you in case you were wondering
nba,removed,the nba is scripted so if this trade went thru i wouldnt be surprised you would have butt hurt lakers fans once again bring up the trade that got blocked the lakers traded bums to get gasol but lakers fans seem to forget about that

nba,removed,he wanted to tell draymond stop with the gay shit without looking like he was bashing gays which he wasnt think of louis ck and the way he explains using the word faggot he was making a great point but people are going to judge him thats just what we do
nba,removed,wheres the racism or sexism

nba,removed,you gunna pay up on that gold bet
nba,removed,to add draymond was setting an illegal screen and basically acting like an offensive lineman on lebron to get curry open on the first screen lebron bounced off and then went to dig into curry and draymond again mauled him and this is when lebron threw draymonds hand off of him and forced draymond to the floor in the best way possible lebron said fuck you draymond and walked over him then draymond punches him in the nads whats funny to me is that golden state fanboys are so upset when it happens to them and call out everyone else but hide in the caves when they know that their golden boy dgreen is out there playing dirtier than ron artest fuck off gs fanboys
nba,removed,this shit is over lebron cant get it done

nba,removed,bad calls on behalf of the refs cmon son he is a one trick pony who took years to shine injuriescoachingmonta set him back most importantly injuries by one trick pony do you mean only scoring a game drawing ridiculous amount of attention from opposing defenses and assisting anyways i look forward to the offseason and the moves that the cavs make for their next championship attempt good luck with that
nba,removed,also because lelbron and the media are faggots
nba,removed,chill out dont be such a bitch no one here is defending dray for his kick or punches to the groin in fact i was pissed when the league wussed out and didnt suspend him in the okc series but stepping over someone is the ultimate disrespect breaking someones ankles posterizing are embarrassing but nothing is more disrespectful than stepping over a la ailue or standing over someone a la pippenewing if he didnt take offense no one would ever respect him again this is why when lue was named head coach everyone made a joke about the ai incident
nba,removed,dank shitpost bruh
nba,removed,cleveland only looks powerful against the eastern conference
nba,removed,i want to console her by giving her the d

nba,removed,got injured and the pacers went from being the seed and an ecf team to missing the playoffs i guess hes the goat no it all depends on the offensive systemcoaching and how well the rest of the players work together mj leaving made the bulls go from a threepeat or greater dynasty to a second round exit the heat missed the playoffs after lebron left because both wade and bosh missed significant time and they also signed a decent amount of new players they made the playoffs this year as a high seed you like all lebron dickriders are extremely ignorant
nba,removed,make your case for kobe being better than shaq retard

nba,removed,you should look up one of those self exams that helps you check to see if you are retarded
nba,removed,youll say anything to avoid admitting he shouldnt have been sent back out there sad youre so stubborn
nba,removed,just go to any default and see how much shit blm gets when its brought up its not really about what subs i subscribe to its pervasive
nba,removed,with you flair as gs i would think youd be watching their games and you would know livingston is the front runner right now for mvp fucking bandwagon bitch
nba,removed,kill yourself
nba,removed,die
nba,removed,nah i aint no fag
nba,removed,youre not going to be able to avoid it so ill just tell you at the end of the episode you see the night king standing on a cliff above his army of wights a giant wight walks up behind him and slices his throat with a dragonglass dagger the others kneels to their new king and shout his name to high heaven hodor hodor hodor the episode ends as king wyllis the wight leads his army south to the wall
nba,removed,hey fuckstick guy thats played the game and watched nba basketball the past decades chiming back at your ace falling down on shots and drives to the basket wont give a ref any due diligence to call a foul for you on a future play when you actually do get hit play tough or accept the no calls this is very prevalent in the nba
nba,removed,whether something you say is hate or not is subject to my interpretation its a fact that youre a dumbass after you say athletes with concussions should stay on the floor you really are just helplessly stupid
nba,removed,tldr deny it all you want but after tonights game its clear bron bron is not the chosen one and may not even be a top player of his generation we all know it on rnba deep down we do we sense it in an insidious way perhaps akin to how one briefly reflects on his own mortality as he rides the subway on a tuesday afternoon only to resolutely remove the thought from his brain and return to his sudoku we bury it and the mods certainly help with that we dont talk about it here but its true bron bron is the the king who never was a false god a sham a huckster a snake oil salesman at going on bron bron is past his prime over the hill which leads us to this question if the best days of bwon bwon are behind him and its clear they unequivocally are indeed behind him how will he be remembered in the annals of nba history in this think piece which i consider to be a conservative response to the liberal smut you read on this sub grantland deadspin the undefeated etc i break down why wittle ittle bwon bwon will not be remembered as a top player of his generation my first point its all about da merch merch merch the modern sports fan has reconciled that the modern athlete prioritizes his own brand and slinging merch over winning titles we just accept it at this point the merch trumps the game itself weve learned to deal with it whether youre wittle ittle wussell wilson cam newton bwon bwon tiger woods andrew mccutchen or anyone in between that spectrum the modern athlete will always choose over rings but leave it to bwon bwon to pervert this perversion and extend it to its absolute extreme bron brons priorities are so out of whack he makes don quixote look like mark zuckerburg many lib pundits defended bwon bwons decision to flee to miami when he couldnt win in cleveland they twisted their peabrain heads into pretzels bwon bwon has to do whats best for bwon bwon cleveland is racist he has no institutional support the nba is slavery and bwon bwon is just exercising his agency etc but we all know the real reason sell jerseys sell more gosh darn jerseys then after titles really as i discount the immaculate ray allen three pointer more on that talking point later bwon bwon stuck his tail between his legs and returned to cuckville ohio where they welcomed him back with open arms like the cucls that they are dan gilbert is the cuck king and again the lib pundits justified bwon bwons decision its his hometown he got the monkey off his back now he can just play etc etc but again we all know the real reason why bwon bwon returned sell product move jerseys when america watched cleveland burn all the bwon bwon jerseys when he left in bwon bwon only saw one thing dollah signz he could sell the jerseys again to those very same people read cucks when he returned and thats exactly what he did bwon bwon has stated on numerous occasions that he considers himself a brand first basketball player second father third he is on the record saying this so thats my first point anyone who prioritizes slinging merch over winning titles cannot be an all time great player my second point the bron bron swimming incident of the mods buried this one so you may not have seen this video the bron bron pool incident of is a perfect metaphor for his career tons of hype tons of glamour tons of promotion buildup buildup buildup then nothing third reason the battery of jewish man david blatt video speaks for itself if this was say andrew bogut jerebko or jj reddick they would be in jail for that that is an offensive bodily contact of another without consent ie battery look it up bwon bwon is a team killer and batterer greg hardo of the dallas cowboys did essentially the same thing and america hates him bwon bwon does it to his own coach arguably worse than ones girlfriend if you think about it given that a coach is a position of authority that should be respected by his own players on primetime tv and people dont bat an eye in fact this sub incessantly praised him and any and all posts discussing this vicious crime were promptly removed with the reddit users banned doxxed and sent death threats by bandwagon cleveland fans aka the cucks from cucksville basically when spre beats up his coach his career is over and now hes allegedly an overweight bouncer at a trucker bar in minnesota yet bwon bwon does it and rnba makes sure his brand goes untarnished reason four relax guys its only basketball bron bron has made a career out of making excuses but he constantly leans on this one whenever he loses whenever he chokes ittle wittle bitty itty bwon bwon utilizes good ol faithful guys its just basketball lol its like when you whoop your little bro in madden and hes super upset but he just like whatever dude its just a video game that is and has always been lebron whenever he loses you can count on him to say something like relax its just basketball larry bird is rolling in his grave various other shortcomings lebron fakes injuries in the playoffs lebron orders other kyrie to fake injuries in the playoffs to deflect blame from himself lebron is a serial flopper lebron fakes leg cramps in the championships come next week lebron will have lost five titles six really as most basketball and nba purists discount the ray allen three lebron has admitted to smoking weed during high school some role model a list of players better than bwon bwon today i end my think piece with this bwon bwon is not an elite player and he will not be remembered as such below is a list of players better than bwon bwon currently playing in the nba i omit kobe since he retired curry durant westbrook harden k thompson aldridge leonard hand size i thomas a bradley perimiter defense matters the most in modern nba drummond you can teach foul shots but not height george lillard duncan dirk so gritty draymond green anthony davis anthonytowns in three years wiggins among others go ahead and downvote you bron bron lovers you sheep we all know it and i will not be bullied by the rnba shills any longer ive been doxxed too many goddam times by rcavaliers bwon bwon is not that good and hes not clutch i said it deal with it warriors in three white mamba out
nba,removed,fuck you cuck god
nba,removed,pure cuck saturated cuck
nba,removed,cuck
nba,removed,cucks
nba,removed,never seen such a successful team have such a hige victim complex some people said that most people werent saying the only reason you won is because they were hurt did it contribute yes was it the only reason no and not many people would say that stop being a bitch
nba,removed,delet your account your life is harrassement
nba,removed,would annihilate that pussy
nba,removed,imgonna get downvoted but hillary is a worse scientist than kneel grass tyson lawnchair
nba,removed,when you criticize the tt contract you prove yourself as an uninformed idiot it was either they sign tt and go over the cap or sign nobody they were already at the limit
nba,removed,frontier was offering an average rate of for laxcleveland round trip bottoming out at but even the more expensive tickets are still only round trip
nba,removed,found the paid lebron shill must you say and do anything to defend this guy at what point does he bear some of the responsability for the disaster that is cleveland read cucksville he fired david blatt yeah kevin love is gritty and has a high bball iq but bron bron demanded he be brought in and he sucks big time and now hes faking injury same as last here he ordered tristan thompson be paid at a year this was bron brons gm work here you reep what you sow when you let someone who did not even complete one year of college be your de facto gm anyway im sure the mods are compensating you well to defend bron brons honor at every turn but at this point facts are facts and were onto you
nba,removed,a jerk to bron bron or to utherealsheriff let me be unequiivocal bron bron and utherealsherriff are fruits of the same tree they dont care about winning or truth or facts or things like evidence they care about da money and that is fine this is america just as bron bron prioritizes endorsements over winning and parenthood he is on record saying this utherealsheriff is being paid to promote bron brons brand on rnba and make excuses at every turn i dont hate this it makes since a fundamental rule of economics is that people respond to incentives pay me enough and maybe ill become a bron bron shill too lol not really but stillmods hit me up lolno just kiddingbut seriously could use worklol but no but at any rate what else explains guys like utherealsheriff he just pops in this thread to remind us the warriors were have three of the best players in the league including the very best an amazing coach who has that rare balance of knowing the game but also knowing how to manage the game plus veteran selfless players like bogut and iggy also out of no where livingstone is god like why does utherealsheriff have to pop in to say that is it a coincidence no hes paid too do so this is a thread about how stats show bron bron is overrated forget the warriors for like one second
nba,removed,ill explain like your because you probably are as a warriorsseahawksnationals hybrid sports fan bron bron is not the official gm of the cavs but he is de facto gm despite not doing a single here of college here are things bron bron did as de facto gm to the cavs made gilbert sign tristan thompson to a fat dollar contract because him and tristan are boys and there wives are friends made gilbert fire intelligent jewish man david blatt after lebron him its classic victim blaming and i am shocked liberal rnba is not more up in arms about that he made the cavs trade for kevin love i have mixed feelings on love and i am on the record as such for a long time now on one hand love is gritty has a high bball iq and is generally known as a real student of the game a bring your own lunchpail to work type of guy on the other hand he fakes injuries in the finals and sucks at basketball and is a team killer although some of that is his team mates being racists he made the cavs trade anthony bennett who never really got a fair shake in this league all of these were bron brons decisions and all back fired if the cavs were in the west the cavs would be a six maybe seven seed tyrone lue has admitted this in numerous interviews
nba,removed,for once i think the over reactions from last night were correct
nba,removed,if the cavs get swept does lebron leave i think theyll win but its an intersting hypothetical
nba,removed,this series is death by backdoor cuts for the cavs its pretty amazing
nba,removed,considering this series over im more concern about his lines and role for space jam now
nba,removed,they only lost because love didnt play the full games
nba,removed,kd and co are probably furious watching the cavs
nba,removed,the final days of prime lebron could finally be upon us
nba,removed,overunder on of comments that are memes refreshing the first few comment makes me sad
nba,removed,well guess were moving the party in here just wanted to say that these next day threads are pretty good for discussion
nba,removed,
nba,removed,the golden state warriors defeat send the the cleveland cavaliers to the shadow realm taking a lead in the series
nba,removed,all i want is jr smith to get a ring is that so wrong
nba,removed,why wont lebron shoot the fucking ball
nba,removed,does lebron still have it in him to deliver his performances of old i dont want to see postprime lebron
nba,removed,name checks out
nba,removed,im looking forward to the lebron james free agency megathread thatll be posted next week
nba,removed,the warriors might be the ones to temporarily bring a trophy to clevelsnd if current trends continue
nba,removed,if someone ever did a documentary on the nba finals theyd title the chapter for game concussion protocol
nba,removed,relevant user name
nba,removed,nothing like regular season basketball in june
nba,removed,is it just me or has the narrative changed to this warriors team is too good lebron doesnt have enough help
nba,removed,i am commenting now as i expect the mods to delete and remove this thread immediately as it points out a negative fact about bron bron the truth is bron bron doesnt care about this hes got his rings really as most nba purists discount the ray allen three and credit that ring to the spurs as they were way better as they proved the following season and the is because of nba lockout shortened season but anyway rings really is enough for bron bron he is content without getting any more he has said so on numerous occasions hes got the fame the endorsements the movie deal space jam will likely be just a hair above shazaam in terms of cinematic quality and just below the little giants and a bunch of regular season records so he likely does not care in his own words its just basketball
nba,removed,cavs in
nba,removed,in a lot of stars withdrew because of terorism which was such a lame excusethe games were held in athens not baghdadnow this bs virus zika will be the perfect excuse for all those divas to enjoy their holidays and not play for their country
nba,removed,why dont you go check out how quickly livingstons points were scored his efficiency and how important his points were for the the win compared to curry youre an idiot jesus
nba,removed,he put tha gs in faggot
nba,removed,i showed my friend the pic and hes like thats gideon yu coowner of the
nba,removed,her daughter some resemblance
nba,removed,pathetic would kobe pass would lebron this is why i laugh at the steph is the best player in the league rhetoric the guy is so soft he could be the next mascot for charmin
nba,removed,httpstwittercomnbalowdown when your girl says she missed her period 🙁 leave above link unaltered messagecomposetotweetpostersubjectsuggestion httpsgithubcomjoealcorntweetposter httpsgithubcomjoealcorntweetposterissues
nba,removed,probably no yes yes little bit but some of it is mental where he seems a bit timid and scared to drive it yes
nba,removed,check the ninja edit you illiterate cunt
nba,removed,i noticed that nobody mentioned how many times malone as mvp or how many times he was all star game mvp or that malone is all time in free throws made in a career not to mention how many times stockton and malone were voted all stars oh and i almost forgot both men are time olympic gold metalists so yea stockton and malone are definitely two of the all time best of the best to me they are the best duo ever and the best ever at their positions
nba,removed,and they say our threads are toxic
nba,removed,im sorry but i dont follow your argument at all are you saying that kobe is better than lebron because he has more rings despite having less mvps assists rebounds steal blocks and a lower career fg but robert horry isnt better than kobe because he has more ringz i think the only retarded person here is you
nba,removed,heads up its the big tree you should consider changing your username it would be better ps duncan is top all time
nba,removed,shut the fuck up
nba,removed,i think we can start by having you shut the fuck up
nba,removed,your argument is shit nice strawman try
nba,removed,i guarantee lebron did not care that much about winning one for cleveland you may have forgotten that after he left cleveland he even mentioned that hes from akron and akron and cleveland didnt get along i actually had no problem with him leaving cleveland because he wanted to chase rings and i have no problem with that a player should be free to chase rings itd be discrimination if fans were cool with old people chasing rings and not younger stars doing the same thing the problem i have is with him making people like you believe he left to win one for cleveland he didnt he left miami because they just lost big to the spurs and wade was hurt and bosh wasnt enough he actually thought that joining kyrie and getting love would be more championship opportunities in the long run remember in the middle of last year where he even talked to dwade about reuniting in miami if cleveland struggled where is the loyalty to cleveland
nba,removed,well for one im gona take the player who can actually ya know play the game
nba,removed,say the word and ill show you multiple examples of you making homosexual remarks about others in this sub id also be happy to show you numerous examples of you calling people retarded on two separate occasions you used viagra as an insult you have used white boy in a derogatory manner every time you talk about sex it comes across like a virgin pretending to be cool in front of his friends if someone wrote you into a movie as a middle school kid from new york the test audience would say that kid is such a cliche the writer needs to make him less of a stereotype tim duncan is top five all time and you can suck my dick if you dont like it you viagra popping retarded chinese bitch
nba,removed,having that all pink diamond lineup was awesome all for free too hope brings back locker codes if it wasnt for that greedy faggot midget chris smoove wed still have them
nba,removed,who is we figures youre a shitty bandwagon thunder fan lol
nba,removed,i just dont understand why rules say teams who discover great players nobody wants bizraps whitesideheat arent allowed bird rights it makes no freakin sense what is the front office nba logic for this nonsense
nba,removed,my source is simple observation a good gm would not have made the kevin love trade ill admit the jr smith shumpert and mozgov deals were good moves but they were made because lebron wanted more help because the roster before that had almost nothing there were reports that his people talked the cavs into getting david blatt fired he did not listen to or respect david blatt you can tell by his on court behavior when the cavs were looking for a replacement they obviously had to run it by lebron because why would they not if they had to fire an already good coach because of him
nba,removed,it probably fills you up with asian pride too huh
nba,removed,well considering the nba is rigged and scripted he will win how ever more the league wants him to kobe has terrible numbers in the finals yet won cuz that is what the league wanted him to win to finish with less than mj td who has way better numbers than kobe also won and may have won a few more if he played for a big market not ratings killers sa
nba,removed,win one at home
nba,removed,and this dude named danny green i said thats it niggas lets crash this hoe
nba,removed,i said bitch where they party go my nigga orpheus started tying that bitch right there i said hold up home boy dont touch that booty yet lemme get in dem draws first i took the gun out my waist hit that bitch in the mouth

nba,removed,games dont make a career sums up your ignorance pretty well have you watched the playoffs at all in last seasons he wasnt healthy in playoffs and still played better than another unnamed guard in the east he was huge in every playoff series in he lead the cavs in scoring throughout eastern playoffs and this regular season hes averaging points careerhigh and asssists shooting over from three and careerbest from the ft line hes having his best regular season in his career
nba,removed,thats gay
nba,removed,youre retarded
nba,removed,or because he led his team to a better record than lebrons superteam while basically carrying the load offensively himself or you could just parrot lebron dickriders here
nba,removed,im not disputing kd
nba,removed,fuck all the warrior curry dickriders
nba,removed,dr boom is lebron because he has a good body and he has two boom bots that follow him around mike miller james jones that can change the game he would be good on every team if the warriors are a freeze mage deck bloodmage thalnos is draymond green because he doesnt seem like he would be good but he can do a little bit of everything and hes irreplaceable in the right deck archmage antonidas is steph curry because if you put the game in his hands he can rain fireballsthrees down on you and he fits well with bloodmage thalnos alexstraza is klay thompson because he doesnt always has his shot but when he does its gamechanging and even when hes off he still has a defensive presence
nba,removed,kobe will score points in his last game
nba,removed,georges stpierre its a recurring joke in rmma that some guy took a photo with gsp and since gsp is huge to any normal man it was rather funny when the guy tried justifying his small stature as being just the angle
nba,removed,this makes more sense no way yi was coming over for less than hibbert coin

nba,removed,i remember the historic season set by the warriors of one win more than set previously by the wayne gretzky of basketball michael jeffrey jordan who had worn the number due to the fact he liked the number but could not wear it because his brother did so he wore half of they came back from a lead set by the oklahoma city thunder featuring the bright young stars kevin durant and russell westbrook how could the sonics let these guys leave their team no wonder they folded lmao they had became up against the east juggernaut cleveland cavaliers in game from my living room i saw lebron tank james block andre igoudala and pin the ball against the glass kyrie clutch irving then hit the to take the lead and kevin love regained the respect of cavs fans and got off the back burner with ac green like defense against the two time back to back mvp unamiously decided in the same season as the finals loss
nba,removed,thats gay af but theres nothing wrong with being gay so ur good
nba,removed,there was a big shooting in orlando
nba,removed,i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about the refs u wouldnt say this shit to them at game theyre jacked not only that but they wear the freshest prison suits eat at the chillest restaurants and hang out with the hottest gamblers yall are pathetic lol
nba,removed,youre a dumbass
nba,removed,sacramento is weak i had to type it in manually because swipe couldnt believe that i wanted to typesacramento ugh
nba,removed,great work from the gsw bandwagon brigade
nba,removed,lol classic youre now a lifelong warriors fan right you grew up near seattle but you always enjoyed the warriors during the im guessing haha i cant believe you actually changed your flair
nba,removed,rnba and reddit in general loves to be controversial for the hell of it a lot of warrior dickriders in here
nba,removed,what are you doi oh nice shot
nba,removed,ah i see someone else listened to the duncd on podcast with kevin pelton and nate talking about hall of fame chances too huh
nba,removed,got me pretty far up your moms pussy
nba,removed,which is why it was do damn pathetic for all the white people here telling lebron to man up or stop being a bitch
nba,removed,what now white redditors haha fucking ugly virgins currys a piece of trash choker now bitch
nba,removed,lol at least their in a nice city unlike trashland
nba,removed,are you talking about maverick carter he never called it racism in fact he said this
nba,removed,fuck foye
nba,removed,foye is a fucking ballhog shit that hinders our ball movement
nba,removed,meyers retard
nba,removed,meyers retard allen crap mason ugly i present to you the portland shitblazers were pretty shit too
nba,removed,allen fucking crap
nba,removed,good point crookeds clit might be even bigger
nba,removed,you dont think mark cuban has spent that amount in a night partying i guess he isnt a mature and intelligent super duper professional if that is the case
nba,removed,he very likely would if someone claimed like you did that he wasnt actually a professional and intelligent man simply because he spent a lot of money on a party because we all know intelligent and successful people would never have an extravagant night enjoying the money that they have earned
nba,removed,thats the point nobody would ever call cuban and his business partners a posse because theyre white ive also never heard anybody refer to steven nashs friends as a posse
nba,removed,omg you do understand there is no article on this thread you are a fucking idiot
nba,removed,shut up faggot
nba,removed,lol ok deleted troll harder you fucking disgrace douche you got so owned enjoy it
nba,removed,we get it you think jokic has a high ceiling wost people agree now fuck off
nba,removed,irvings hype isnt just coming from the finals though it isnt like he all of a showed something we had never seen from him before he just did it on the biggest stage so more people finally took notice but consider this he was the overall pick in and in his first five years in the league hes averaged nearly pts while dealing with some injury setbacks remember hes still just years old and yet has already had some big moments in this league including wins rookie of the year in scores points vs the knicks in msg just years old makes the allstar team in just his second season mvp at the allstar game the following year scores points vs charlotte scores points vs portland scores points vs san antonio scores points vs golden state in the finals on the road facing elimination shoots had three consecutive pt games in the finals averaged pts on splits in the playoffs he obviously has undeniable talent and he still hasnt even hit his prime yet he still has to work on some of the other aspects of the game but his potential is out of this world
nba,removed,not even trying to be mean but you seem like a really stupid person
nba,removed,she is a hoe case closed
nba,removed,think thats crazy this rapist got upvotes for the original thread in rrelationship and nobody calls op out on it
nba,removed,my favorite hhh moment was that little ginger kid posting a picture of himself there was roasting for sure but it was mostly really goodnatured and everyone gave him respect for handling it so well good bunch of folks
nba,removed,hes just saying they are guys so of course they were going over to this womans house for sex apparently the effeminate sjw white knights are desperate to twist it into some toxic masculinity bullshit its crazy how effeminized we have become look at the writer of the article she looks like a bull dyke feminazi
nba,removed,hype is strong
nba,removed,lol it is a civil case you ignorant fuck
nba,removed,had those tweets been in reverse order it might have gone over a little better
nba,removed,donald trump leaves a bad taste in everyones mouth
nba,removed,wades cousin was killed and his niece was in the line of fire trump used that as an opportunity to make a bizarre public statement about how black people should vote for republicans i think that would leave a bad taste in anyones mouth
nba,removed,yeah no shit how awful must it be to have some tragedy befall you only to have trump bust in like the orange mr kool aid
nba,removed,man hes being a lot more civil than i would be in his situation
nba,removed,seriously how does anyone think this moron is fit to be a president
nba,removed,what do you call your cousins child
nba,removed,the second tweet was trump showing compassion but it came after the tweet trying to capitalize on incident what does hillary have to do with anything
nba,removed,on a side note trump is one of those people that thinks that as long as they dont use a racial slur they arent racist
nba,removed,youre right that the cousins daughter is actually wades second cousin but lets not play semantics here most people dont really care about the correct terminology in this case
nba,removed,wait so what would your parents cousins be
nba,removed,who cares its blood its family
nba,removed,httpiimgurcomwtdnnwegif
nba,removed,trump you hear that folks i was in d wades mouth
nba,removed,magic only played two seasons without kareem before retiring cuz aids yeah russell had an amazing team and his teammates deserve much more of the credit he gets i actually mentioned jordan in the post too though its probably hard to see nbsp oscar is actually a really good comparison hes still respected as an absolute alltime great but he only won a single ring and he got it as a declining player largely riding peakkareem as his young horse thats how i see kareem with magic at least for the last couple titles nbsp would kareem still be considered top with titles in seasons how high does oscar rank despite only having one ring how much higher would he be ranked if hed had a great team in his prime and ripped off the russellesque dynasty he probably deserved
nba,removed,i dont know reddit is filled with cucks someone should be able to fill you in

nba,removed,fucking hardaway that faggot couldnt even defend or rebound right and then he decided to finally be useful in the final games fuck that garbage player
nba,removed,welcome fag
nba,removed,if they all stay healthy i expect them to get the eighth seed and win one game against the warriors in the playoffs
nba,removed,im not going to let think fucking progress inform my perspective on a goddamn sexual assault case well thats what youre soung considering youre using their argument and saying you wont look at the other side you are arguing against someone that is merely saying to look at both sides of the story thats my argument simple as look at both sides only on reddit with a bunch of armchair progressives would that get downvoted as for the accuser smearing yes please keep going you claim that smearing the accuser happens in every high profile rape case then you list two names go on list as many as you can think of since theres just oh so many you should be able to get to easily get to or
nba,removed,youre kinda slow arent you
nba,removed,im not expecting a dunk parade a few would have been nice im just saying its boring basketball and they didnt feed that many people in the post they are a good team just a boring one
nba,removed,why its true liberals want to force their agenda on everything including things irrelevant to them
nba,removed,i bet your mouth would feel nice around my balls
nba,removed,sprash
nba,removed,you houston retards keep repeating the same bs over and over again steve made his team better harden doesnt you can keep downvoting the truth but everyone knows harden just simply sucks on defense and doesnt really make any team better anyway
nba,removed,do you know of any that are not currently on basketballgmconf
nba,removed,kevin garnett httpsthumbsgfycatcomwelldocumentedsecondarygalapagostortoisesizerestrictedgif jae crowder were not so different you and i goran dragic russell westbrook
nba,removed,holy hell youre stupid
nba,removed,curry sucks ass at defending gtfo
nba,removed,and let go of bogut ezeli speights rush and barbosa lmao gsw dickriders are blinded by kds sperm they got him yes but lost the biggest advantage they had on other teams their bench i mean its just my opinion but if you ask me trading all of them for another ball hog that will ruin the chemistrykd an ass nobody center zaza and an old washed up west is a bad move so happy the warriors are mental my cavs are winning another ring for the land
nba,removed,more proof that carmelo and lala are raging homosexuals
nba,removed,your opinion isnt valid because of your race which races would you consider to be the most informed i wasnt aware ethnicity prevented people from being informed
nba,removed,disregarding the fact that most of the people currently affected have been vetted for years now what more exactly do we need to ask of them why do you feel their specific countries who have collectively attacked us times in the past years should be treated this way
nba,removed,probabilities are not certainties look at they even couched their predictions in terms of error because that is how polling works but once again you are citing ignorance as a defense they are wrong we are right again i want to point out that you are not making an argument against what i have put forth the only thing you are doing is questioning the credibility of the sources in doing so you are delegitimizing that anything can be known just as importantly you allow a president who lies directly to your face to get away with it
nba,removed,people who believe that inhumane things are right are not decent human beings i thought that was obvious and it has nothing to do with agreement or disagreement
nba,removed,i have plenty and thats why im able to ask these questions im not attacking you im genuinely curious you are downplaying how a lot of us feel we understand that there is terrorism im not saying there shouldnt be a reformed immigration policy but you do understand the executive orders that have passed correct
nba,removed,the seven countries mentioned in this order havent had a citizen commit a fatal terror attack in the us in twenty years you might as well issue an executive order to deal with grumpkins and snarks though at least that wouldnt hurt real people
nba,removed,agreed but how is that trumps fault
nba,removed,no seas un cubiche
nba,removed,nah literally everything and everyone outside of maybe subreddits a few swing states and the whitehouse are paid liberal shills
nba,removed,its the first time green card holders and permanent residents have been prevented from returning to their homes en masse
nba,removed,look i think all lives matter okay oh wait were not talking about black people nvm america first fuck refugees
nba,removed,yes i understand what you are trying to say you are saying that this was obamas list and i am providing you with a link explaining why and how trumps executive order is different you continue to ignore it
nba,removed,my understanding is its the first blanket travel ban that does not exempt refugees with green cards dual citizenship
nba,removed,til having empathy is bad ill signal my virtues all over you face
nba,removed,not sure how you can compare such a small occurrence to a radical terrorist movement
nba,removed,the issue is that it affects legal immigrants such as gc and visa holders not just refugees people that are already legal residents
nba,removed,you know this sub loves ranking top xs
nba,removed,nihilistic hatred of his fellow man misery demands company for some
nba,removed,i will join you in collecting downvotes the temporary immigration ban is an ok thing to do
nba,removed,failbama i mean really failbama thats the best you can come up with ignoring the ignorance of your entire comment this alone should exclude you from rational discussion
nba,removed,welp theres been plenty of genocide too guess thatd be fine as well
nba,removed,why do you condone jeopardizing the security of the us in favor of non citizens thats your argument fail harder
nba,removed,what are you trying to say
nba,removed,go shit signal somewhere else
nba,removed,love how everyone is stressing that this is non divisive then they downvote you into oblivion for well stating your opinion i have no definite opinion on the matter but its a shame that no one can freely challenge the rhetoric of comments in here of the country is in favor of the ban rasmussen you all who are allowing this issue to divide yourself from one another are whats wrong with this country right now its a matter of policy belief move along
nba,removed,obama never once banned iraqis he temporarily suspended the visa process for people thereanyone who was already cleared to travel to the us was allowed to come we never once had a month in where iraqis did not enter the us get your facts straight or dont bother
nba,removed,so basically the smartest retard
nba,removed,the classlessness dirk shows is truly disgusting instead of shaking hands with the opposing team he runs off the court show some respect to lebron you racist pos cant wait til hes out of the league
nba,removed,yeah i dont plan on not speaking my mind trump may be a butthole but we dont live in communist russia im going to speak my mind and people can agree or disagree haha p
nba,removed,meh this is actually something the mods should take down its not basketball related at all
nba,removed,would you even be able to see zach randolph in a dark alley
nba,removed,
nba,removed,wait until china takes over after trump destroys america
nba,removed,wow everyone going crazy about trump but in actuality theyre also racist themselves
nba,removed,just as ignorant as every other trump supporter
nba,removed,lol wtf the kid is shooting sixers have been complete and utter shit until the last few games which ruins your entire argument youre fucking dumb
nba,removed,uhhh no lebron understands that since hes dark skin that makes him one of the players who white america allows barkley to troll notice barkley never does this to white nor lightskinnedblack players all nba players notice it perhaps you should too lebron has put up with it for yrs and finally let barkley know that he sees right thru his racist games
nba,removed,you tried
nba,removed,wasnt it last year that like a quarter of the league was traded in one day
nba,removed,kenny smith is a piece of shit too while were at it
nba,removed,no she is not the best player in the league candace parker is still the best player in the league nneka and maya moore are there as well and theres a case to be made that breanna stewart is even better than edd edd is terrific but not the best
nba,removed,
nba,removed,fuckers in the ymca talm bout carmelo cant do this carmelo just said that shut the fuck up
nba,removed,lebron went full on trump what a lil bitch
nba,removed,i love how you made this thread with the intent of openly discussing the possibilities and not just bashing him go fuck yourself
nba,removed,called me insecure when presented with logic check told me to get over it check displays and inability to use critical thinking or see reason check im going to go out on a limb and guess that youre a trump supporter you keep repeating you just cant compare them because you cant even if i show why its reasonable to i cant show why its reasonable to because it isnt reasonable you cant compare a players accomplishments to a teams there are a completely different set of standard to do that
nba,removed,
nba,removed,it appears you have used the word bitch have you checked your privilege today maleprivilege patriarchy
nba,removed,rio me the fuck up
nba,removed,america is turning to the wwe with trump as the president
nba,removed,ehrmagerd lebron watches out for his friends and business associates what a special snowflake
nba,removed,same shit trump does its pretty pathetic
nba,removed,its funny because this is exactly how trump won the presidency say and do outrageous things and double down if anyone calls you out on it lebron doesnt stand a chance against someone like barkley
nba,removed,he also hit an epic end of the first team ever to go undefeated and won the ship in awhile
nba,removed,chuck was talking about lebron asking for more pieces to an already championship caliber team nothing had anything to do with people acting buddy buddy on the court his lebron not competing was about building a team that cant lose guys talk while free throws are going on all the time i dont see what that has to do with being competitive
nba,removed,like any european hes reverting to his soft jump shooting ways now that kobe isnt yelling at him maybe some people think that a soft jump shooting european is a stereotype or a strawman but think about paus natural tendencies for a bit if you conducted naturalistic observations of pau over a long period of time where you watched him shoot hoops alone in a gym what do you think hed do practice boxing out back his defender down work on putting a body on his man and crashing the glass no hed practice his jump shots and post moves like the greasy european he is theres a reason so many europeans use fancy colognes and use pomade and let me tell you it isnt just for the overpowering smell and wellmaintained hair
nba,removed,from the rchicagobulls thread when he got fired seemed like he got stale kicked from two straight playoffs because the offense couldnt score worth a damn he was stubborn and inflexible not to mention how the team just rolled over in the elimination against the cavs theres a lot of heart on this team and a performance like that is a direct indication that theres something wrong with the coachteam relationship pts thibs was really the only coach who coached his players into the ground korver even said how hard practices were and how it wasnt really enjoyable pts minutes for kirk hinrich in that game we managed whole points good riddance pts so emotionally conflicted thibs was so damn good but so damn stubborn pts good coach hard worker but he is not a players coach and he had too much of his focus on one end of the floor which we were average at this season i appreciate everything you did thibs hopfully this doesnt blow up in our face pts hindsight is lots of love from him in the thread too but i stick by what i originally said no reason to fire him is dishonest
nba,removed,hahaha embiid is a legend man you cannot hate the man
nba,removed,lol ok im so sorry posting on the wrong sub hehe
nba,removed,youre some stupid reddit fuck who gives a shit what you think
nba,removed,its probably because hes mentally drained by donald trumps regime just like the rest of us
nba,removed,seems incredibly naive to think that while trump builds a wall or tries to everything is going to be cool with mexico
nba,removed,donald trump does
nba,removed,donald trump
nba,removed,that piece of wisdom hurts extra bad when trump has the nuclear codes
nba,removed,becuz they are sheeeeeeeeeeeeeep cleveland won last year cuz it was scripted for them to just like it will be scripted for them to this year and green got suspended for betting purposes him getting suspended had nothing to do with the outcome of game cuz cleveland was winning straight no matter what happen but if green plays and cleveland wins then that means for game and most of the public would bet on cleveland which means vegas would lose and the league cant allow that if anyone believe gs just suddenly lost straight with being at home is a moron games and were blow outs yet gs just suddenly loses game and at home hahaha in both game and gs in the quarter basically laid down to make sure cleveland won in game they didnt even score in the final mins cleveland was sooo bad that it took them mins to finally make the gw shot barnes in the first games shot over yet in the final games he shot just hahaha he laid down to match loves pathetic play also curry laid down as well so this year i expect kd to lay down and klaycurry or maybe green it is and sheep still havent realize that the nba is fixed and scripted gs winning games was scripted just like gs going down to okc was scripted just like them blowing a lead was scripted just like this year cleveland losing all the time to west teams is scripted gs may win games again which is scripted
nba,removed,if i gave a fuck about your opinion id kill myself
nba,removed,donald trump would go full mad
nba,removed,nitpicking something that happened some years ago you leftist fucks sure are desperate
nba,removed,melo and jokic would be the scariest duo in denver since eric and dylan
nba,removed,now you are posting on a different account lmao fuck off and go away
nba,removed,michael wouldnt shill for hillary no way she corrupted the dnc rigged an election i can understand voting for her because she isnt trump but if you actively and vocally support such a terrible person then youre either an ignorant person or a corrupt one
nba,removed,has trump ever said anything racist towards blacks
nba,removed,hillary literally eulogized a grand dragon of the kkk and referred to blacks as super predators and pushed for welfare reform which put blacks back decades trump purchased maralago which was an all white country club at the time and opened it to everyone regardless of race then he shamed filed lawsuits and fought an extensive legal battle against the council so that the other club owners of palm beach would open up their clubs to blacks and jews as well and while trump was fighting for equal rights in palm beach hillary had joined an whites only country club mr trump also has resorted to the courts to secure his foothold here and many residents wince at the attention his legal battles with the town have drawn — to the town in general and to the admission practices at some of palm beachs older clubs in particular the culture clash began to approach a climax last fall when mr trumps lawyer sent members of the town council a copy of the film guess whos coming to dinner a film that deals with upperclass racism mr trump then approached the town council about lifting the restrictions that had been placed on the club he also asked some council members not to vote on the request because their membership in other clubs created a conflict of interest last december after the council refused to lift the restrictions mr trump filed a lawsuit in us district court in palm beach alleging that the town was discriminating against maralago in part because it is open to jews and africanamericans the suit seeks million in damages mr foxman seems pleased that mr trump has elevated the issue of discriminatory policies at social clubs he put the light on palm beach mr foxman says not on the beauty and the glitter but on its seamier side of discrimination it has an impact in recent weeks mr foxman says the league has received calls from jewish residents telling of how palm beach clubs are changing locals concur that in the past year organizations such as the bath and tennis club have begun to admit jewish patrons the palm beach civic association which for many years was believed to engage in discriminatory behavior this month named a jewish resident as its chief officer

nba,removed,you have a mental list of favorite retired athletes the fuck
nba,removed,isnt this the aint no fun unless the homies get some case

nba,removed,the league is not better when those teams are competitive maybe from a historical sense but the league has plenty of good teams coming up who have never been here before that is what makes the nba great when bad teams can become good the league is shifting from a i want the spot light mentality to a i just want to get paid and win that is why the lakers and knicks of old arent landing big time players players want to make money play ball and go home no one has time for that la or new york non sense any longer
nba,removed,mods please ban some of these dumbasses the shitposts are getting out of hand
nba,removed,kd is only three and a half years younger though its not like year difference i mean with the stamina and longevity lebron has shown so far in his career i could legit see kd starting to break down faster than him being more injury prone and all that theres a chance small i admitt that kd will never be heads and shoulders the better player than lebron in a single season

nba,removed,special guest hannibals brother
nba,removed,i dont profess to know the details of the law regarding introducing sexual history in cases but it absolutely should be allowed the woman had dna from multiple partners in her panties that absolutely plays a role in judging whether the encounter was consensual or not its very possible the encounter started perfectly consensual and then kobe did something that she disagreed with thats a very gray area because are you going to say hes a rapist because he tried to put it somewhere it wasnt wanted in the heat of the moment and her objection to it makes it rape im pretty sure most of us have tried something with our partners that got an oh hell no response those conflicting witness reports also weaken her case as if she were really so distraught about what happened she never would have bragged about it in the first place
nba,removed,youre a fucking idiot who doesnt know shit
nba,removed,no snakes in the grass because tobias mowed them nigga

nba,removed,time for the jazz to take control of the west
nba,removed,ive never understood why people randomly hate the city of cleveland as for the rest of your point jordan chose to retire why the hell would lebron deserve an injury because of that and kobe never tore his acl he tore his achilles and he was already years old at that point but its nice to know that you are rooting for an injury to the best player of the last years because you somehow think he somehow deserves it
nba,removed,i hope president trump overturns this imagine the confidence this wouldve given dwight i want this on his box score and legacy fucking huge block
nba,removed,except a lot of people were vying for the hiring of defensive minded coaches for the rockets at the time i was just adding that to the conversation go fuck yourself

nba,removed,u r a dum
nba,removed,dude youre living in fantasy world if genuinely believe kd is better defender than lebron ever was you have exited reality have a good rest of your life but as a favor to society and this sub keep your homer opinions to rwarriors
nba,removed,please leave this sub you are just trolling at this point
nba,removed,i cant use lebrons s because of matchups lmao your mild autism is showing bud kd was playing well until he had to actually close out the series at which point he went in a fucking closeout game you literally cant defend this even if you are a kd dickrider also unless you are literally autistic which i assume you are given your logic everyone can see he choked away the fucking series dude back to back to back atrocious quarters its easy to have good s when you do well for quarters then disappear keep dickriding a choker and realize he wont touch greatness ever
nba,removed,im usually pretty skeptical about point guards that arent black because the coordination is usually lacking and the ballhandling skills tend to be ass unfortunately grayson allen looks like hes either polish russian or canadian none of which carry african genetics so no i think he wont do very well in the league but i hope he does
nba,removed,youre a dumbass
nba,removed,i personally think that melo needs to realise that he isnt stranded alone anymore even when there is an open man he tries to make his turnaround jumpersalthough a lot of them goes in right now he is from and i think that oquinn and hernangomez deserve at least a slight increase in minutes
nba,removed,fuck off queer
nba,removed,i like the last line the most its like hes bragging that he finally got a girl off he sounds like a true dickface
nba,removed,this has already been answered
nba,removed,do you actually think i gove a fuck

nba,removed,pretty much this yup
nba,removed,why would i be salty just because i insult people doesnt mean im salty its just fun offending a bunch of pussies
nba,removed,new episode out today fellow nba fans let us know your thoughts on this process of an nba podcast means a lot to us thanks
nba,removed,no they didnt im so tired of this the league didnt do anything that was completely baffling does that mean the league screwed the warriors out of a championship last year the last games of that series were waaaaay worse than anything that happened during that suns playoff run including the spurs series plus the warriors were a game away from a championship unlike the suns who still needed to win six games
nba,removed,miamai ot away with more fouls id estimate in the just last minutes of this game than any other team has ever gotten away with a series abyssmal this was the game that cemented the notion that the nba is completely and utterly rigged and the front office forces game results based on economic forces if they call that foul on bosh sa wins and lebron really has legacy to talk about cant have that now can we
nba,removed,and thats coming from the gayest looking fellow in the league
nba,removed,brazilian bro here living in rio this zika thing is so overblown by international media that its absolutely mind boggling people here couldnt care less about zika meanwhile overseas theyre treating like its some kind of pandemic thats going to end humanity just emphasizing this story is absurdly overblown by you guys

nba,removed,are you retarded
nba,removed,fuck off
nba,removed,all of these issues can be easily solved and theres no constitutional right to fly hell the government could just make it an advisory list and every airline out there would ban the people on it out of fear for liability issues the real problem is a lot of the biggest gun nuts out there also usually have white nationalist or militia ties so they are all afraid this will be used to take their guns there needs to be a bit more transparency with the no fly and terrorist watch lists although i can understand cases where it could be damaging to security to release certain namesreasons i dont think theres much abuse of it now given the number of people on it vs the population but there is potential for abuse which is never good when you know the government over time will exercise every power it can
nba,removed,what does that have to do with mozgovs knee to klays thigh and klay wasnt talking about the nut check he was referring to lebrons whining to the media about drays trash talk right

nba,removed,draymond green is a bitch
nba,removed,true spacing is key for klayklay dude is an awesome scorer with a great feel for the game however if things were crammed on the perimeter i dont think he would be as efficient i dont agree with the harden opinion though his defense is something worth noting but i dont believe he can run the show offensively and get others going like harden especially off that pick and roll
nba,removed,mediocre players tend to focus more on the xs and os and strategy side of things than great players who while smart are able to lean on pure talent also a great player would find it hard to coach because he would see something that came easily to him and wonder why his player cant do as he did
nba,removed,you have no idea what the fuck youre talking about he didnt ref a game in the series at all go back into your dank dark whole of what if
nba,removed,kg ray allen and paul pierce
nba,removed,then why didnt they ease shump back into the the starting lineup where he never has been for your team moron

nba,removed,hes saying the league was worried about wolf being niggardly with the strikes
nba,removed,just my opinion but pretty much anytime people try to explain things by using a millennial argument they come off as tryhard stupid and uninformed like its just a complete guess pretty much i dont see how at all this is a only specific to this time period or b this is because of millennials and then at the first sign of disagreement this is how you respond

nba,removed,clipsspursrockets should all have an enforcer start blatantly kicking their leg up on rebounds but not hit anyone just to store as evidence then if you meet dray in the wcf just have that same guy rock dray in the head so hard he has to sit the series
nba,removed,its hilarious how everyone mentions the bay instead of the shithole that oakland is also if everyone there has the mindset of klay then i guess theyre all fucking pussies who got their feelings hurt but act like its a mans game when the shots are falling

nba,removed,
nba,removed,no its just bs made up by the plethora of lin dickriders on this sub melo actually said he would love to have lin back on the team after he signed the rockets offer sheet even mentioning the lack of good pgs on the market but clearly a bunch of neckbeards on rnba know more about the knicks organization than he does melo called that contract ridiculous when lin signed and lo and behold the guy who practiced with him more than anyone knew he wasnt worth that much as weve seen since he left the knicks amare made comments about the whole team being jealous of lin and everyone assumed he was only talking about melo in fact amare specifically said he wasnt talking about melo a few days later god forbid that one of the greatest scorers in nba history is hesitant to give up his role to an undrafted player with good games under his belt as all the lin supporters on this sub will tell you lin is a goatlevel pg that has just been utilized incorrectly in every game since linsanity
nba,removed,shut up bitch
nba,removed,no lin fan thinks lin is a goatlevel pg none of us thinks hes a superstar the fact that youre taking such an obvious exaggeration so seriously shows me that youre grasping at straws only lin haters like you say stupid shit like this all the time the amount of blind lin dickriders heavily outweighs the amount of lin haters both on this sub and in general i dont even hate lin i hate his dumbass fanbase that tries to bring race into every discussion about him and his supposed lack of calls he can do no wrong in a lot of fans eyes and thats why they feel the need to shit on guys like melo and harden excessively he was unwilling to move to the false all he said was that he prefers to play the when his team is fully healthy and the same goes for guys like lebron dantoni tried to blame his own failures on melo and amares reluctance to play out of position and thats why the knicks got so much better after he was fired just last season melo said that he expects to spend a lot of time at both the and the he was unwilling to allow lin to take up the spotlight he craves he was unwilling to have lin be the main ball handler thats all speculation also melo is never the main ball handler even without lin and like i said melo knows lin better than you or any of his fans do even if it were true he was right about lins actual skill level and he had a right to feel like all the hype was undeserved considering that melo won the scoring title and led the knicks to their first playoff series win in years without lin the very next season i think he deserved a little more respect than the fans game him oh and its funny how you claim amare said the whole team was jealous of lin and then turn around and leave melo out of the whole team that is exactly what amare did first he said a lot of times you gotta enjoy someones success and that wasnt the case for us during that stretch then he said this he explicitly says knows i wasnt talking about him that so called actual quote you brought up was referring to the triangle offense not lins role on the team saying three quarters of the team thought the triangle offense was great is not the same as saying three quarters of the team thought lin was great
nba,removed,is there any way you would consider an account that is not a year old

nba,removed,i live in the pacific time zone i usually spend hours on rnba and sometimes more i have been a part of this community for about months although not all on this account started off just reading alot on this sub until i finally made an account i think i would be a good addition as a modfor a couple of reasons i really love basketball and the nba i spend a lot of time catching up on news and watching games during the season i think i would be a good moderator because of my love for basketball and also because i want to make this sub a better experience i have spent a lot of time on this sub that i know how it works and what people want i feel that i can help and i want to help if i could change something from this sub i would want to include more more activities and discussions that would help the community interact and have things to do maybe have the team subreddits make a project and then present it to the nba sub i think my favorite or at least one of my favourite nba memory would be the warriors point comeback against the raptors a couple of years ago i do not have experience in css as i had told a mod i do not have the one year requirement mentioned but i still think i would be a good fit as a mod i hope to show you what we as a group can accomplish thank you

nba,removed,u keep telling the story as if you were there you dont know what happened when he got into that apartment only people know what really happened and you definitely arent one of them you have so much to say about a situation his own family doesnt even have full details on youre the real villain in situations like these pointing fingers and passing judgement like youre an angel fuck people who think like you theres no video footage of anything so stop acting like you know everything you just see a black person gets shot and want to make him out as a thug like everyone else this guy has never committed a crime in his life youve never met any of the people involved in the situation but all of a sudden you know whos a bad person or who deserved it or who you dont want to get to know
nba,removed,that was the real nba finals we witnessed in the wcf

nba,removed,httpiimgurcomkbwirqwjpg
nba,removed,my blood pressure sleep schedule and beer intake is going to be off the charts these next weeks
nba,removed,there are rumors in circulation saying this was nbas attempt at making it go to game for ratings and money
nba,removed,adams nuts didnt die for this
nba,removed,
nba,removed,remember when thunder fans were calling over after games peppridge farm remembers
nba,removed,
nba,removed,oh gee golly wiz i hope iguodala stays in the starting lineup
nba,removed,theres gonna be a new wheres durant headed thread every two minutes for the next months
nba,removed,look who lost their cool conversation over youre not even evenkeeled enough to have a simple debate over the internet now youre whining like a little bitch and for the last time i never blamed the shooter and im not his friend he was my brother you asshole
nba,removed,of course youre a warriors fan careful not to break daddys merchandise now
nba,removed,this is still joe lacobs fault right
nba,removed,pulling for the cavs to get channing frye a ring
nba,removed,clevelandgolden state iithe runback
nba,removed,maybe
nba,removed,i have a tv like a non autistic member of so im good
nba,removed,actually he came back as tried to get me banned and coincidentally had a meltdown and was himself snuffed out too bad i enjoyed his bantz
nba,removed,lets make this finals appearance brotha
nba,removed,its really interesting how we evaluate things in the moment vs after or so years for a homer example take curry biggest finals choke ever and the means nothing without a championship but there are multiple all time greats who never won a ring are all of their career accomplishments worthless because they didnt do it in the playoffs is getting far in the playoffs and losing worse than not even getting that far thats the lebron vs mj debate lebron has already made the finals more times than mj but he was playing superior competition in every finals where he lost except i imagine in years close to half of all basketball experts will have lebron as their goat his ability to take any team hes on to the finals is fucking absurd but his teams have never been as good as the bulls so he doesnt win every time he gets to the finals theres more nuance to it but i do think making the finals is an incredible accomplishment in and of itself
nba,removed,happens when ur ft and play like a guard
nba,removed,damn young magic looks a lot like kyrie irving in that first clip
nba,removed,he gets credit because he won a fuckin championship from against a team with the best regular season record ever what more does the nigga need to do
nba,removed,are you insinuating that all black people are ghetto and all white people are rich
nba,removed,i agree with you on everything except for one thing probably half of this sub religiously watch that abomination of a show the ratings dont lie
nba,removed,what about kd
nba,removed,he also destroys dd in ts ast stl trb per and hmmm
nba,removed,i thought we could make the wcf if we got lucky with livingston and kerr i also thought dray should be starting over lee long before his did
nba,removed,i have a hard time understanding how black people speak on social media i guess that makes me some sort of racist or something
nba,removed,i read your article i enjoy what you write even if i wish you would get down in the dirt with me my comment which you replied to was in response to someone who wrote about rose at this point i dont even remember what in any case it wasnt a criticism of your article i dont think its fair of you to call what i wrote a rant i was trying to engage you more than anything in a conversation about analysis and how to use facts that arent hard stats which i find interesting not about derrick rose i originally used the ray felton example to make my point but since that didnt work i switched over to rose only to make a clearer contrast do i go on rants about rose all the fucking time i do but thats because he is symbolic of the reason why the knicks will probably never win a title in my lifetime which depresses the hell out of me and then i look around and i see people not even really you although you have written nearly as prolifically about rose as i have reacting the same fucking way as they always have to these types of moves its like all i want is for at least the truly passionate knicks fans out there or maybe at least the smart and passionate knicks fans which is a small group that you are part of to tell me that im not crazy and to spend at least some of their energy expressing anger towards the front office that they so wholly deserve but instead people just want to make excuses and rationalize the gross incompetence of the front office as though the last fifteen years havent been the same story with new faces and just enough new wrinkles
nba,removed,i think youre just a hater or very high coach k at duke wouldnt recruit someone just cause thier daddy plays ball no one is calling him an allstar but he got game
nba,removed,currently unable to get on an mls roster and playing in a lower division squad
nba,removed,hahahaha a future filling up the l column
nba,removed,haha neither does ours but yours relies on two players with injury histories instead hahahaha
nba,removed,there is no way in hell the cavs would get the seed without lebron they might not even make the playoffs
nba,removed,that n is guilty
nba,removed,😂😂😂
nba,removed,actually we are born that way its a evolutionary trait from hunter gatherer days different means could be dangerous its natural to be racist its also why when you are in a strange environment and you see someone who looks like you it makes you feel a little safer because shared physical traits often means shared life experiences which means you have things in common and is moree trustworthy for all the haters this is a college class im quoting so if youre just waiting to call me dumb feel free to leave cause youre wrong
nba,removed,whered you come up with that one
nba,removed,giannis plays around the basket because hes one of the best finishers in the nba you have to get to feet before melo outshoots giannis and the difference from is the same as the difference between the two at meaning theyre both equally better than the other at what they do as it turns out three point shooting isnt the only thing that matters in the nba and if you think saying giannis cant shoot is an actual argument im done talking basketball with you because youre fucking clueless youre championing a career three point shooter as your bastion of shooting that is fucking ridiculous
nba,removed,youre the fucking dumbass comparing a perennial allstar to a no shit melos stats are better if you compare their most recent seasons why do you think i used melos stats you clueless moron if melo can go from a garbage shooter at age than why cant giannis considering giannis is better than carmelo was seriously you have to be fucking dumb as dirt to compare a to a thanks for wasting my time you complete idiot
nba,removed,look a new york sewer rat that learned how to use a computer
nba,removed,interesting youre a moron
nba,removed,theon greyjoy
nba,removed,i was gonna watch this video and then make a snarky comment like i wonder if putting that ring on felt the same as fingering adam silver before game but its hard to hate on someone elses joy he did what he was destined to do as a child his sole purpose as a human being and im genuinely happy for the guy
nba,removed,httpzunoxidenet been watching this fine with ublock
nba,removed,first of all im obviously joking about him being the best player in the world but ill provide explanation for why people love him hes a great player like really is really really good and he did that without a real point guard hes improved every year he was invited to team usa this past olympics but declined because he was having a daughter i think hes as good as jimmy butler and his per possession stats back it up but thats a pretty unpopular opinion httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpyqayhmrbxe beyond that hes really grown into his shoes as the leader of this team lots of people think we need a star player but if he keeps improving as he has there is no doubt he is it
nba,removed,personally id rather see another western city added when you consider how far west certain current wc teams have to travel would probably want a true western team like san diego las vegas or vancouver because it would finally allow memphis to move east as they should be hard to say how accurate this is but i found the same info on a few websites and it is a few years dated but it states that vancouver has million tv households httpwwwcanadatvmediacomcanadiantelevisionstatisticshtml i suspect its counting the whole province of bc rather than just than just the metro city which makes sense as anyone who lives in bc is always a fan of the local vancouver team even if we assume that number is lower id suspect its no where less than the top when accounting for us and canadian cities only down side of them really would be having two teams seattle added in such a close vicinity
nba,removed,flair up fag
nba,removed,hes lying
nba,removed,top my dick hole
nba,removed,ya his wife is getting brain surgery i dürr i wonder when he can play again for us durr ah durr fuck your dumb
nba,removed,youre a fucking idiot how about when lebron scored straight in the to hold off the warriors comeback kyrie played really well but to say lebron didnt contribute in a way that only the all time greats do is wrong and stupid to even think
nba,removed,your moms vag smells like my fist
nba,removed,your seriously a sad little boy
nba,removed,totally homerism but ours got remade a month or two ago and its pretty clean i think also rchicagobulls is great everything branding related with that team is so on point that even their subreddit is great
nba,removed,looks like a fag
nba,removed,it shouldnt he never raped the lying white bitch
nba,removed,fuck off
nba,removed,shut the fuck up
nba,removed,express yourself my ass its a childish tattoo and i wouldnt take anyone serious who has something like this on them downvoted me though because this is reddit and we love everything and everyone lol
nba,removed,year old retard dont come in here disrespecting willis reed fuck you
nba,removed,shoutout to the wnba you got some fine ass bitches i wanna fuck in the mouth
nba,removed,and like i told your ignorant fucking ass before i never said anything was rigged i said things changed and it favored cleveland but go ahead ignore what happened because youre fixated on the result
nba,removed,i respect stephen curry i really do hes a good shooter and and undisputed top player in the game but heres the thing u can be as good from behind the line as u want as good behind the further back line as u want as good in the paint as u want but to be a real legend thats not enough u gotta have that killer mentality that lebron vs boston game lionheart spirit u gotta be able to talk the talk and then walk the walk thats what jordan did points against one of the greatest teams of all time rings the shot the shot thats what lebrons done last points vs one of the goat defensive teams two triple doubles to clinch championships rings fmvps winning one for the land back to back point monster performances all the truly clutch superstars of this league have one thing in common they simply refuse to give up u knock them down theyll come back up u punch them in the face theyll shit on your family jordan had consecutive first round eliminations he got bullied by the bad boy piston thugs so what does he do he peats twice lebron didnt win a ring for the first years of his career he choked in surrounded by two other all stars so what does he do he goes out and dominates he wins rings as the man then when thats not enough he goes back to his shithole of a hometown and wins one for the land as well why because he can steph simply put doesnt have that mentality that ice cold fire running through his veins true legends dont take a backseat to a guy who averages on the greatest stage in basketball they dont win mvps then choke horrifically in crucial game they dont get shut down by one of the worst defensive liabilities in the league they dont make excuses they just win and they win as the man as the fmvp jordan did that bird did that magic did that lebron did that shaq did that kobe did that steph hasnt done that and until he does he will never and i mean never have my respect and amongst all the disappointments he produced last year that may be the greatest tragedy of them all
nba,removed,her name is monica dosrios and there are text might be doctored or not from her floating around literally talking about how shes going to extort rose for money back in the early
nba,removed,yea hes so old school that he got spanked bare ass naked on his college locker room floor with a smile on his face complete old school mentality if you dont believe me you can google it a thumb even went into his ass
nba,removed,to be honest theres a hint of racism every time i see it since ive never seen someone say this about a nonblack player public speaking is diffcult go fuck yourself
nba,removed,lol heres the deal i didnt read any of that shit why because youre a white person telling another white person about what black people should be offended by you selfrighteous clown

nba,removed,no
nba,removed,that article doesnt mean shit stop bringing it up show me the stats that prove that almost every time someone refers to a black person as well spoken theyre doing it out of racism show me that article because what you linked is nonsense people can choose to be offended by literally anything that doesnt mean theyre correct if you tell a black person that you like their shoes and they respond by claiming your comment is racist and theyre offended what would you do would your apologize for being racist this is a link to a comment you made read the last sentence you typed there and yet here you are a white person trying to speak on shit that you dont know lol you think because you read an article in nyt that youre now a fucking expert on black people and what should offend them do you not see how selfrighteous that is of you heres a link to a comment you made yesterday where you make a homophobic comment regarding someone jerking off lebron because they are a fan given your very delicate sensibilities in regard to race i would say this comment by you is blatant homophobia on par negatively as well spoken heres another comment you made yesterday where you refer to a guy you dislike as a bitch is this not inherently misogynistic also on par negatively with well spoken now imagine if i based my entire opinion of you off of this one comment of yours imagine if i made the decision that you are a misogynist who hates women thats what youre doing with this well spoken bullshit so just so im clear homophobic and misogynistic comments are okay but calling a black person well spoken is where you draw the line lolol you hypocrite let me bold this last part for you youre a white person trying to police other white people on what black people find offensive you accuse others of being racist based on extremely minimal information youre a selfrighteous douche who needs to climb out of his own ass
nba,removed,that you think should have somehow won the title every year jumping to bullshit conclusions about things i didnt say i knew you were stupid i said he went to the eastern conference semis times the eastern conference finals and the finals when he was with cleveland thats a fact thats almost the same as kd did when he was with thunder and what did they both do after getting close to a ring and not winning one they both left to join better teams god you fuckers on here are dense i guess thats why everyone says that rnba is fucking cancer downvoting actual facts because it doesnt suit your narrative im done with you kid
nba,removed,heres how i dispute the article some people find it offensive im not talking about that you are what ive been saying the entire time is that theres no way you can prove that the overwhelming majority of the time when a white person calls a black person well spoken they are doing it with some level of racist intent you cant know it because you dont know every single persons intent thats impossible so please for the love of god stop moving the goalposts and of course you didnt respond to my example because you know your thinking is flawed calling out other white people on ignorant bullshit lets say you come across a random comment on reddit that says buddy hield is well spoken please tell me how you know for a fact that this person is saying this out of racism please tell me how you are so sure that this person is making a racist statement that you take it upon yourself to browbeat that person and lecture them on racism you are so full of shit dude you place these terrible characteristics on people without giving them the benefit of the doubt you immediately assume the worst in everyone when you do this do you honestly think youre helping do you think you make any fucking difference with your white knight internet comments be real youre just stirring the pot so you can have an excuse to act holierthanthou and police people get off your high horse man i enjoyed reading your reply to your homophobic comment i bet i could find a fancydancy article that proves your comment is homophobic maybe i should just to watch your mental gymnastics but i dont really care im not the type of person who goes around policing language and acting insufferable finally and most importantly op said calling a black person well spoken is the same as saying oh my god i thought this guy was an idiot i responded with bullshit nobody said that you can be smart without being well spoken this is where you decided to jump in show me where anything i said prior to you entering is incorrect and made you feel obligated to try and correct me
nba,removed,would it really be that big of a deal genuinely curious i support teams in indiana even though i dont live in indianapolis or bloomington never seen it as a big deal
nba,removed,why him instead of gobert or draymond
nba,removed,what is it on my comment that you disagree with its it the part where i say nobody said that because nobody said that its fact so it cant be that one lets move to the other statement calling someone well spoken is not the same as saying oh my god i thought he was an idiot and guess what its a fact that those two things are not the same why because you can be smart without being well spoken and vice versa its a bullshit statement that is completely false so please tell me which part of my comment is wrong and this time try not moving the goalposts
nba,removed,first and foremost you definitely are a selfrighteous clown second saying well spoken is not that different than oh my god i thought he was an idiot is absolute bullshit not the same thing at all this is common sense third the first two things are fact so i wont be addressing them anymore fourth if you wanna go around looking for things to find offensive so you can stand on your high horse then go for it but fuck off because i dont need that kind of negative shitty view of the world around me you obviously just look for the worst in everyone you go around labeling complete strangers as racists like a stupid fucking asshole people like you are ridiculous you go around calling people bitches and using homosexual sex acts as punchlines yet you are oh so fucking happy to police others over the pettiest of shit youre a hypocrite youre an oppression monger if youre not playing the victim card then youre busy trying to censor the world people like you act like youre so fucking progressive and forward thinking when youve essentially horseshoed your way into the people you despise i bet youre the type of person who thinks its racist if white people have dreadlocks because its cultural appropriation i mean a bunch of famous black people said its racist so that means its racist right thats your logic seriously fuck off i dont respect your mindset its divisive and youre just stirring up drama and youre doing nothing to help youre literally just policing people on the internet do you think that makes a difference do you think anyone gives a shit about your two cents get over yourself maybe you should give people the benefit of the doubt instead of being an accusatory douche i dont respect you because you dont respect others im the words police and youre being racist so you shouldnt say that anymore by the way im white but its okay because its my job to defend black people when there are none around im an ally clowndick motherfucker go away with your cancerous bullshit
nba,removed,nope im not establishing anything with you youre being patronizing dude i dont respect your mindset move on get over it
nba,removed,fuck i didnt even want to play this game anyway reminded me of
nba,removed,thats good for both teams in my opinion is pretty hyped right now embiid is doing great and simmons will be able to play soon so playoff hopes are actually good on the other hand lakers at least will have the chance to rest a little more between remaining games playoff chances might be slim but fresher legs could create some momentum for them too
nba,removed,i do zubac is gonna be better fight me
nba,removed,on rstatistics and i think my issue is that i may have forgotten to add iseason into my xtreg if you can help me out with this i would be super thankful
nba,removed,lol if okc wasnt a shit organization hed still be there
nba,removed,you notice he said that before kd went to gsw its called a compliment and if you really think the warriors arent a better organization than okcwhy are we having this conversation
nba,removed,yeah and whats the current starting lineup gsw okc on organization
nba,removed,so your basketball team is moving like feet to the left and then you got the raiders back from la and they didnt have a football team for years dont act like your city is in so much pain dumbass
nba,removed,
nba,removed,unban eg
nba,removed,eg is a prophet holy shit
nba,removed,making something up is not the same as typing a comment without an outline pretty stupid retort
nba,removed,what does that even mean do i have a cavaliers member organization tag or something im not a cavs player retard
nba,removed,well there second best player wanted to stay in his prime so its not really screwed up there as you think
nba,removed,lol faggot
nba,removed,those punk ass coaches act like something other than points and rebounds help determine wins and losses
nba,removed,draymond was absolutely trying to send a message it was an intentionally hard foul even klay admitted after the game that draymonds foul probably warranted flagrant
nba,removed,odd that klay thought draymonds intentionally hard foul probably warranted flagrant seems like the intent was to send a message
nba,removed,odd that klay thought draymonds intentionally hard foul probably warranted flagrant seems like the intent was to send a message
nba,removed,agreed odd that klay thought draymonds intentionally hard foul probably warranted flagrant seems like the intent was to send a message
nba,removed,the only message that was sent during the mlk day game is that the officiating will be drastically different in oakland vs cleveland in cleveland the cavs get away with extra physicality on steph and in general in oakland the warriors get away with illegal screen after illegal screen
nba,removed,youre a sad strange little man
nba,removed,youre dickriding lebron and are downvoting anyone who doesnt do the same unless you think that im just magically being downvoted by someone else youre a dickriders and you are also very very delusional so delusional that its honestly a threat you yourself as a person and you need to find help for it before you seriously hurt yourself
nba,removed,fuck you both
nba,removed,and fuck you
nba,removed,and fuck you too
nba,removed,sully is the goat
nba,removed,the problem is that any time a person who is white tries to argue against so called white privilege they get screamed down as racist and that is bullshit because white privilege is a real documented testable thing what you are describing sucks but guess what everything you describes happens to blacks and other minorities white privilege is not an i win card its a structural advantage in society that benefits white people its not saying your life is automatically great and has no problems its a tangible measurable advantage in wages police interaction and other opportunities in our current society hell your argument is you cant get food stamps and have a shitty car but you saw someone get in a nice carthat may not be theirs and you dont feel safe going to a restaurant in a black neighborhood woah is me you know why its hard for you to get food stamps because it was a push to stop black people from stealing welfare you just got a taste of it
nba,removed,a lot of the black people i know are some of the hardest working people i know guess what you fucking idiot those arent the type of black people that popovich was referencing when he said white people dont understand black people
nba,removed,shaking my duster
nba,removed,suck my dick
nba,removed,suck my dick
nba,removed,as a black man myself i feel like it finaly be gud that a whittie is actually agreeing to stop killing all my brothers and sistas out on dese streets i mean shieet we elected obama we havv power in dis country its time for the whitties to realize the true power of the black man
nba,removed,shut the fuck up already you fucking idiots are insufferable you arent victims so shut the fuck up already you arent special people fucking hate your asses because you think you are special black lives matter black lives matter no one else matters but black lives we want dead cops we want dead whites yeah thats really promoting the right message you fucking morons you want the truth the truth is whites dont give two fucks one way or another about blacks we pity you stupid fucks because you kill eachother and then blame it on the white man or blame it on cops because thats the real problem not the rampant black on black crime or the gun violence in the black community nope its that damn devil white man i personally love that you guys destroy yourselves from the inside and i care little if you fix it its your fucking problem keep your god damn side of the street clean but dont expect us to send sympathy your way and on that note be the little bitch youre going to be since i fucked up your safe space and report me cunt
nba,removed,what a fking idiot hed never live in a black neighborhood or send his kids to their schools though enabler pure and simple

nba,removed,maaaan this dude hasnt even passed kareem yet not even magic what is everyone saying this hype will die down with time though i remember this happened with kobe in and shaq early on as well
nba,removed,lol this is a major shitpost but hes definitely not a coach lover its well documented that he wants as much power as possible
nba,removed,this again pretty sure ive seen you make this same comment multiple times and pretty sure ive seen your points disproved many times too hes the only player in recent memory that has had shit talked about him because of his salary generally fellow players are happy when someone cashes in i would like to see your examples and if counts then so do john walls comments about and and as far as getting stopped by security it happens occasionally throughout the league from what i can tell its happened a couple times to lin but isnt common heres a couple stories from the past years about it happening to players nonasians as far as the rockets sub thing i mean thats just plainly not evidence of racism and even if comments on the rockets sub counted as racism i dont believe they are anywhere near as prevalent as you think they are and its not like this is specific to lin the lakers sub still actively hates dwight howard moreso than the rockets sub hates lin

nba,removed,seriously i mean god damn not only do people force politics into the conversation but they will casually throw their opinion in and act like its fact sorta like the electoral college which didnt work out too well for americans this time around i know so many people who would disagree with that not that i want to make this a debate on the topic which is why i downvoted the dude for his irrelevant comment not because i disagree with him im pretty sure rnba is a prime example of a type of subreddit that people go to to get away from non stop political talk leave that shit in rpolitics where i can distance myself as far as possible from that echo chamber

nba,removed,because its honestly kind of funny talking to a trump supporter is interesting to me i sometimes wonder what kind of biological and hormonal imbalances people like him have that make them so dense and wrong about everything they say the guy literally tried arguing with me that lebron james is the fastest mile runner in the nba ive run competitively for years mind you i think its safe to say i know a fair bit about the topic and his words were yes im being serious if you can sprint the length of an nba court you can sprint a mile and this guy was being dead serious and went on and on with it i tried explaining it to him from a runners perspective why that is blatantly false tried linking him articles that literally prove his claim is false by explaining the difference between fast and slow twitch muscles but honky stayed dense lol
nba,removed,i cant help but think wow what a great example of nepotism how team members like curry were private schoolbred students but the truth is most of the nba is filled with athletes from affluent backgrounds lebron james stories are pretty rare
nba,removed,the author might not be jackie chan or jeremy lin but he is an extra salty faggot i got called stojakovic my entire bball life and i dont care why because its not racist or a negative stereotypeim serbian i have a big nose and i make it rain down if they called me divac i might get mad because he was a flopartist

nba,removed,
nba,removed,you dont speak for the entire planet moron people can use whatever words they like and if you have a problem too fucking bad
nba,removed,or a rabid fan takescare of him
nba,removed,how are people this stupid
nba,removed,in college sure in the nba not even close um it absolutely is hes playing against better longer more aware defenses here he cant make the same passes hes been making his whole life its just easier for nba players to defend an offense with a first option that can only score in one way big surprise there again the kid is you must think that hes a year old international import or something passing outside isnt even that hard and its not difficult to learn if you have even a little bit of passing ability he just hasnt been asked to do very much of it in the nba and needs practice i wasnt just comparing him to embiid you can take embiid out of the picture here the main point there was that the sixers are much worse offensively with okafor in than when they have holmes or noel playing center unsurprisingly you chose to ignore that and made this about embiid for some reason you say its exactly as you say this is only a problem with okafor on it doesnt persist with any of their other bigs just look at these stats from days ago first in the league in passes made per game their ball movement and spacing is great whenever okafor isnt in the game but it all collapses when he comes in maybe you should think more logically about the real cause of the problem here try thinking more about why this happens instead of just making excuses saying things like the sixers dont care about okafor theyre trying to win games they wouldnt just purposely kill their offense whenever this guy is in the game lol come on mate like i said ignoring what ive been saying wont make it go away the sixers have been the worst offense in the league for several years running its literally the most dysfunctional offense in the league their spacing sucks their guards suck i can go on and on wtf do those stats mean when the reality is that the sixers have the least efficient offense in the league and by quite some margin and what do they mean when okafor is getting low quality minutes with bad teammates and watch the plays the sixers run with okafor on the floor they put him in there to score and not much else they havent developed a kick out game with jah in the post which krzyzewski did and dont expect him to playmake again lowe says this as well im backing my arguments up with a legit party source which you havent done so and once again sixers have the worst offense in the league with our without jah can you connect the dots here the sixers are a terrible fit for jah and everybody except you knows it love how you conveniently ignore this over and over again maybe you should think more logically thats not what i meant at all i meant that your top scoring option cant only have one way of scoring in this case for okafor it would be in the your best option shouldnt have only one way of scoring and theres no modern day precedent for an offense working around such a player obviously i didnt mean that would be the only option in the entire offense im not sure how you can possibly continually misunderstand this point i keep making and then go on to say that a point you dont even understand yourself is completely arbitrary but why why would jah even have to be the option you seem to be incapable of understanding this concept but workingbuilding around a player just means that you set up your team comp to get the most out of him it doesnt even mean that you have to make him your main weapon best player or whatever like i said working around okafor means that you surround him with good shooters and ask him to facilitate by telling your shooters to spread the floor well and get ready for passes this is what krzyzewski did and its not even that complicated of a scheme if you dont want to start him then bench him for all i care all its about is maximizing his strengths in a tactical perspective which the sixers infamously have not been doing again sixers have a shit offense with poor guard play and so run isos for okafor whenever he gets those shit minutes i think its you whos having trouble understanding lol how is this possible when i said i agree with what zach lowe said could there be a more clear sign that his points arent relevant to my concerns that me agreeing with what hes saying again i said i agree with lowe are you just going to ignore that haha what is this bs lowe said he believes that okafor is stuck in a very poorly fitting team and believes that he would thrive in a system where he can pass out to the perimeter towards good shooters so you agree with him good im happy that you could admit that you were wrong pfft hahahahaha just so dumb youre getting lost in your own arguments people from rnba who dont even watch the sixers might agree with you but philly fans who watch him play would agree with me times thats retarded sixers fans who commented to my post in this very thread agreed with me and disagreed with you they downvoted you en masse let that sink in for a sec we this doesnt even matter that much i dont see anywhere where lowe says that okafor isnt immobile off the ball obviously he can make some quick moves at the ball but to say im wrong when lowe doesnt even address that point is hilarious having quick feet doesnt make a player fast okafor isnt fast bruh maybe its because lowe knows that the off ball stuff can and does get better with time for young players off ball is an effort problem for okafor not some physical impossibility you get that youre gonna have a bad time if youre expecting centers to be fast hes a smart player with good hands vision and enough athleticism to get his ass moving on defense when he has to he gives glimpses of a revving motor now and then again playing amid subnba backup units is hurting his development kids and has all the right tools to play off ball pnr whatever hes stagnated in the worst offense in the league how many times do i have to explain this to you before it gets through that thick thick skull of yours hell never be viable so you know more than lowe eh or danny ainge whos been trying to get him lol and you keep forgetting that hes been getting low quality minutes this season due to embiid along with having to play with subnba teammates for the past two seasons his teamoriented play is bound to suffer do i need to copy and paste it also hard to guard with good shooters around him is actually a statement i agree with hell okafor is hard to guard right now but that doesnt change that the offense as a whole suffers with him in the game hard to guard isnt enough and thats shown clearly by how bad the sixers offense is with him in the game lowe also makes zero comment on okafors off the ball play already addressed this and yes please do so i never even used advanced stats as an argument but since you brought them up jah ranks last among phillys centers in obpm and orpm if you can understand that his teammates who are centers that also play for the philadelphia have better offensive advanced stats than okafor then you cant really use his team as an excuse again not trying to use advanced stats as a main argument here but this clearly shows that the problem isnt with his team which is precisely why lowe and i have said that he needs a different system and different players around him in order to succeed a highly skilled center like okafor takes a lot more care to use well than a high energy rebounderputback artist what have you been listening to the whole time are you seriously trying to deny the fact that the sixers are a shit fit both in terms of offense and personnel with a guy like okafor youve literally missed the whole argument here thats embarrassing dude ugh this is getting boring im very disappointed in you

nba,removed,not at all if you obtain even the most basic reading comprehension his emotion on the subject enhances the points he was trying to make cuban is making an investment in the future by overpaying dirk when the next big fa comes along mark can say sacrfice now become the face of the franchise lets try to win a championship and i will have your back when you are its the long con riley was greedy and players probably wont forget that all in all they are both high level decisions made by people who are far above our paygrade im sure there are plenty of factors involved that remain unseen

nba,removed,he looks like clevelands answer to kingpin
nba,removed,i find it amusing that your hick genetics took the time to capitalize the start of all of my sentences and then think you schooled me i guess this is what it would be like if i could talk to my dog
nba,removed,whats your wifes number ill try to talk some sense into her
nba,removed,people have much higher expectations out of lebron though hes correctly being held to different standards
nba,removed,it aint fake like yo bitch ass
nba,removed,lol
nba,removed,jinxed it hahahahai cant wait for the shit show that follows them losing this series
nba,removed,lolwut cleveland hasnt struggled on the road they are and should be but the garbage league had to extend that series to go at least by rigging game in which cleveland still barley lost cuz more games more money the raps on the other hand are on the road that is struggling hell gs is on the road that is struggling as well and out of those losses have been blow out losses
nba,removed,i was joking 😂 damn you guys are easy to offend
nba,removed,reports of the cavs death have been greatly exaggerated
nba,removed,you know that feeling of relief when youre constipated and after several days of drinking tea and eating laxatives you finally squeeze out what had been ailing you thats what winning last night felt like same level of relief
nba,removed,go cavs
nba,removed,this series has lasted longer than expected biyombo must be ecstatic that it is tho
nba,removed,game summary in youre tuning in tune out lowry reaction when looking at his box score mozgov playing in the quarter
nba,removed,youre an idiot if you think that stephs gravity doesnt make an impact
nba,removed,yo this threads gotta be posted earlier especially for the east coast games ffs what else am i supposed to read during my morning dump
nba,removed,so basically toronto will win game in a tough and close battle then go back to cleveland for game and get beat by again
nba,removed,but i cant help but feel like lebron is coasting through this series the very simple fact is this in terms of finals appearances lebrons career is a joke so what you gonna do you try something new something like youre not the only person on the court
nba,removed,lolwut it is okc not tied how does gs win the series if they win tonight when they have to go to okc for game where they have already been blown out twice gs is suppose to win tonight this series is over barring a massive rig job i expect game to be rigged for gs to win just so this series goes at least just like the other one
nba,removed,arnt you the guy who made the death threats to some redditor and his family how are you still posting here
nba,removed,well i didnt ask any of you i asked that spurs dude because i knew he was talking out of his ass its amusing how insecure you heat fans are about this though
nba,removed,heres the thread can find the stuff hes talking about down at the bottom
nba,removed,i spent way too long looking for the next day thread for this game and didnt even noticed it was stickied now
nba,removed,whats so funny dumbfuck

nba,removed,most people on reddit have multiple accounts you can read my comment history if youre desperate for a hot take analysis on my online persona i just think you are a one sentence moron no troll intended
nba,removed,everyone who disagrees with me is stupid or a child seems like a very mature point of view you have there

nba,removed,lets be honest here guys everyone is trashing the cavs right now but we have to consider the absolutely ridiculous performances from klay and our twotime league mvp steph curry never before has a team slithered with back cuts and hard screens under the noses of a great cleveland defense crashed the boards with such tenacity and kicked it out to so many excellent shooters so far the warriors have this finals down pat

nba,removed,that is now what youre being asked in order for you question to make sense black people would have to be disproportionately targeting white people the question being asked to you again was if black people disproportionately target white people in the same way that police disproportionately target black people in killings and the answer is no this is ridiculous define targeting as it relates to interactions between civilians because something tells me that it will look a lot like murder rape battery armed robbery etc are those people not targets of their perpetrators come on black people perpetrate violent crime at disproportionate rates the victims of those crimes were targeted are any of these studies about white people or are they about the police force the studies include all races thats how you determine if theres disproportionate treatment also for some perspective black people do not disproportionately target white people false black people do disproportionately target white people ive already proven that the only way this isnt true is if you dont think murder victims were targets as everyone else that loves to distract from the problem of police brutality in this country brings up the overwhelming number of victims of black murder is other black people yes that also is true what im saying is true blacks kill whites in vastly disproportionate numbers more likely in and what youre saying is true blacks are murdered by each other more than any other race what you seem to be failing to grasp is the fact that im not going to indict thousands of good people white black hispanic asian male or female unless the data is clear and convincing its not the crime data is fact there is more violent crime in black communities this isnt only verifiable by the links ive already provided but its common sense where is gang violence the suburbs rural america no urban innercities where do blacks live who comprises gangs what else contributes to the crime poverty of course blacks are more likely to live in poverty okay those are terrible obstacles but it also explains why police are there it explains why they have more interactions with a population that happens to be the most violent based on statistics not feelings data pretend youre a police chief in dallas you have finite resources you have a community to protect where do you put the heaviest police presence where will they be able to save the most lives and capture the most criminals white rock lake highland park places where theres relatively zero crimeno black people or fair park oak cliff places where theres a lot more crime that happen to be predominantly black for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction i wish cops never killed anyone i wish they never had to interact with the public at all but when they do its reasonable that it happens in higher rates in places where more crime occurs again more of the problem did you read the study i linked or not black people are disproportionately killed when unarmed youre arguing that black people are somehow disproportionately violent even though the study plainly states that police killings arent at all linked to neighborhood crime rate they didnt even evaluate if those unarmed deaths were justified no there arent httpwwwasanetorgsitesdefaultfilessavvyimagespressdocspdfasaracecrimepdf but youre right i was not looking at studies so much as statistical analyses i wont link them because i doubt they would carry any more weight anyway since they arent studies or research papers though i do think that those analyses are accurate its not a conspiracy when its uniformly agreed upon in academia the fact that policing has a race problem is no longer an issue of debate in the fields of sociology or psychology i guess it depends on how you define the problem in my opinion if white people committed an equal amount of violent crime per capita to their overall population the percentage of violence against that class would go up without a doubt that just makes sense youre in that neighborhood does it make sense that more blacks have to deal with cops than asians yes is it fair no but its the world we live in im all about trying new solutions i think ive been very clear that i agree there is a use of forceescalation problem i just dont believe it is racially motivated though as you point out the results are racially disparate short of killings it would seem i think theres a lot of truth to the explanation regarding trainingexposure and how that can account for higher rates of police shootings of nonblacks even when those communities are less prone to violent crime the cops in those communities are poorly trained because they dont deal with it every day the cops in the black communities show more restraint as it relates to shootings because they are trained and experienced they still shoot a lot of people but the overwhelming majority are justified even the unarmed cases often involve a suspect reaching for the officers waist their own waist using a vehicle etc thats not to excuse those shootings as ive said actually theres nothing cloudly about that dataset whatsoever as it has a a significantly larger sample size than the one youre trying to use youre also completely ignoring that the study youre trying to bring up found racial discrimination at every single level but did not have a big enough sample size for shootings in year im not ignoring that im not arguing the results im arguing the motives are police intrinsically racist against blacks or are they riskbased policing black community members are one of the biggest reasons police have increased their patrols because they dont feel safe in their own communities the communities where the vast percentage per capita of crime happens newton was right and yet all the data suggests that it is and the very reason activists are frustrated is because people like you will do everything to ignore the fact white people arent the center of this systemic issue i thought they were arguing that white people are the center of this issue white supremacy this white supremacy that regardless i said it doesnt have to be racial whats more important changing police behaviors or convincing everyone that police are racist and keeping the black man down will police behaviors change extra special super good once black peoples claims are vindicated see told ya now lets talk about changing your behavior who gives a fuck do we want change or not because i can guaranfuckingtee you that people will be a lot more receptive to change if youre not indicting them in the process you introduce the accusations about the character of millions of people and a lot of them wont care how important the cause is
nba,removed,midlevel athletic center nah a midlevel center couldnt do the things he did or even close his intelligence combined with his otherworldly athleticism is what made him great if youre calling him a midlevel athlete you are very very misinformed to be sure championships would not happen in the modern game and teams led to a much more diluted era however this does not take away from how great he really was i have him at somewhere between on my centers list i cant decide lol
nba,removed,bitch ass nigga
nba,removed,i dont disagree that he was the best player on those celtics but that doesnt mean anything hahaha its like if the warriors win the championship next year and steph is the best player on the team does that necessarily mean steph is better than lebron no it doesnt and he couldnt shut wilt down lol look at their head to head stats wilt destroyed russell the rest of the celtics destroyed wilts teammates though again youre blinded by wins and rings russell was on by far the best team of the time he was the best on that team but he wasnt better than wilt call me when russell has rebounding titles scoring titles leads the league in assists eclipses ppg in a season and leads two record setting teams if you want to include team accomplishments as an argument for personal greatness if you truly want the find the most dominant and best centers ever its kaj wilt and shaq with hakeem a close russell has no argument to be up there with those and just so you dont bring up that idiotic point again rings arent an argument end of story tldr russell was on by far the best team of the he was shit on by wilt and was not as good of a player youre blinded by rings leading you to make a stupid selection
nba,removed,holy fuck youre dense i just told you why that doesnt matter and why team accomplishments mean very little can you at least read what i said before spewing your asinine comments everywhere hahahahahahahahah

nba,removed,what the fuck did you just say you cocksucker
nba,removed,are you too dumb to see the hypocrisy in your comments
nba,removed,morons who have kids when they shouldnt what like your father
nba,removed,this is actually the best comment on here

nba,removed,its sad that youre so fucking stupid you cant recognize a response to your own question retards like you should have their up banned from posting
nba,removed,username confirmed fuck off with your retarded sports mind guy and im also not your buddy pal your just a fucking idiot
nba,removed,post was deleted earlier by the mods hopefully its allowed here just trying to raise awareness for the sub hey guys this is just a reminder to come on down to rthonmaker for the upcoming draft tons of stuff will be happening including a pre draft thread which is already up all sorts of predictions and of course all things thon in thon we trust

nba,removed,there was constant debate between magic and bird for about years before jordan took the title outright jordan was in the conversation with magic and bird for or years wilt and kareem were mentioned but they werent seriously considered by most during that time
nba,removed,honestly dude it was relevant up untill the last couple of games against miami
nba,removed,no way minnesota goes for that
nba,removed,based on actual incidents and not just a blanket ban based on religion you can cry librul and try to point to that as many times as you want it simply isnt the same thing trumps is way more destructive and only in response to his bases fear of muslim people just admit that muslims scare you we all know they do
nba,removed,so that doesnt justify what trump did which was unconstitutional and made us look spineless to the terrorists you think hes hard on terrorism but hes just perpetuating their ability to recruit disenfranchised muslim people its the same as his stupid fucking wall symbolic and empty and ineffective
nba,removed,creepy old ballfondling uncle hes real slick before you know it hes turnt your ankles and youre on your back with legs splayed then a quick kiss off the back and hes slipped it right in real disgusting straight up nasty with his moves between your legs right in your face he does it all changes his rhythm up but its always smooth n slithery really works the feet gets those legs shakin works every time on both young and old sometimes or at a time keep him away from my boys please he spooks me
nba,removed,so your argument is that because trump created his prepreemptive unconstitutional bans based off a list created by obamas administration of countries that pose terroristic threats to america its somehow automatically justified and because obama did something similar in despite it being actually justified and grounded in reality and actual investigation and not paranoia and fearmongering then the two are one and the same fucking flawless please continue to approach the stupid choices and opportunities to flex nuts you dont have for the remainder of this term with the same weakass arguments its working so well so far
nba,removed,dont forget the
nba,removed,president trump just added lgbtq discrimination to the vetting list love it
nba,removed,president trump just added lgbtq discrimination to the vetting list love it
nba,removed,donald banned sudanese muslims from entering the us canada is outside the us and the nba has ties with sudan to help kids become basketball players how is the fear of travel issues that irrational not to mention rnba is probably the wrong sub for trump support right or not youll prolly get downvoted
nba,removed,ha yeah dude just keep telling yourself that trump is the savior of the lgbtq community because he did the minimum amount of legislative duty required days after he should have because of the response his thoughtless actions received
nba,removed,at the end of the playoffs every year
nba,removed,jesus bootum i can smell melos nuts in your mouth also you answered your own question in your first sentence if you want attention get a dog
nba,removed,dont be a cunt i saw that live and he was bumped by meyers leonard
nba,removed,i just dont feel good about it i dont feel right about it im against it and i take a lot of heat because i come from new york you know for new york its like how can you be against gay marriage but im opposed to gay marriage donald trump but i guess he didnt say climate change was a chineseinvented conspiracy either
nba,removed,yup and crazy thing is i really havent seen many trump gathering in cleveland i was so surprised trump won in ohio
nba,removed,youre a bitch
nba,removed,melo takes bad shots to score points he must be good
nba,removed,draymond green is a knee garrrrrrrrrrr
nba,removed,yesss
nba,removed,portland blew a golden opportunity there
nba,removed,because thats what roommates do shoot shit about sports trump means very sad
nba,removed,stats support it too tbh
nba,removed,the comment section is pretty bad warriors fans are outta control they cant keep lbj cavs and the fanbase outta their minds
nba,removed,trump is a piece of shit yeah i said it fuck you mods
nba,removed,maybe once trump fails we can try electing an nba coach
nba,removed,hes not really risking much by saying this nba players tend to be antitrump and the bay area is very liberal his statement will probably upset almost none of his players or fans if anything itll just get people who already like him to like him more
nba,removed,hey fuck you too buddy
nba,removed,somebody should tell trump its not muslim ban because during the election he called for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our countrys representatives can figure out what is going on trump says hes banning muslims bans muslims then his supporters say hes not banning muslims makes sense
nba,removed,that depends kerr isnt really risking much by saying this nba players tend to be antitrump and the bay area is very liberal his statement will probably upset almost none of his players or fans if anything itll just get people who already like him to like him more billy donovan on the other hand would not say this his players would probably support him and respect it but oklahoma city overwhelmingly voted for trump it would probably cause a big fan backlash in his case
nba,removed,not only muslims it bars entry to the us from countries countries chosen by the dhs trump did not pick the countries banned if you think its profiling take it up with the dhs because theyre the ones that put countries on their danger list
nba,removed,this is just the start
nba,removed,i really shouldnt get into the weeds on this on rnba but while the ban is not effectively banning all muslims religion was the motivating factor behind the order and you dont have to take my word for it as rudy giuliani said himself first announced it he said muslim ban he called me up he said put a commission together show me the right way to do it i get that it isnt technically a ban on muslims but when the guy literally campaigned on the idea of banning muslims from entering the country until and i quote we figure out what the hell is going on its hard to say that a ban on immigrants from seven predominately muslim countries that have not been the source of major terrorist attacks on us soil has nothing to do with religion
nba,removed,i said it once today on thus subreddit and ill say it again trump spent months advertising this as a muslim ban blame his campaign for making it divisive and misleading
nba,removed,yes they do its identity politics calling it a muslim ban is a dog whistle meant to make people feel like trump is being racist i imagine if it was called the national security act or something there would be a lotless outcry
nba,removed,curry to the cavs confirmed
nba,removed,yes it does heres the httpsirusembassygovprotectingnationforeignterroristentryunitedstates i hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the united states of aliens from countries referred to in section of the ina usc this section of was modified in the countries reffered to are as followed i in iraq or syria ii in a country that is designated by the secretary of state under section of title as continued in effect under the international emergency economic powers act usc et seq section of title section of title or any other provision of law as a country the government of which has repeatedly provided support of acts of international terrorism or iii in any other country or area of concern designated by the secretary of homeland security
nba,removed,yes but trump did not choose the countries heres the eo i hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the united states of aliens from countries referred to in section of the ina usc this section of code was modified in the countries reffered to are as followed i in iraq or syria ii in a country that is designated by the secretary of state under section of title as continued in effect under the international emergency economic powers act usc et seq section of title section of title or any other provision of law as a country the government of which has repeatedly provided support of acts of international terrorism or iii in any other country or area of concern designated by the secretary of homeland security nowhere in there does trump list off those countries or say anything about muslims if it is antimuslim than take it up with obamas dhs because they designated these countries
nba,removed,president donald trump said in a new interview friday that persecuted christians will be given priority over other refugees seeking to enter the united states saying they have been horribly treated i dont think its a muslim ban because thats the twitter hashtag i think its a muslim ban because i dont blind myself to technicalities congress didnt declare war on vietnam and korea does that really mean we didnt go to war its called logically thinking youre allowed to do that ps if your arguments are going to continue to be youve been dog whistled by the media and a set of he didnt say the word dont worry about hitting me with another response
nba,removed,as for why they were chosen ill share my comment from somewhere else from the eo i hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the united states of aliens from countries referred to in section of the ina usc this section of code was modified in the countries reffered to are as followed i in iraq or syria ii in a country that is designated by the secretary of state under section of title as continued in effect under the international emergency economic powers act usc et seq section of title section of title or any other provision of law as a country the government of which has repeatedly provided support of acts of international terrorism or iii in any other country or area of concern designated by the secretary of homeland security all of these countries were designated by dhs before trump took office the reason i say its not a muslim ban is because its not just affecting muslims the entire refugee program was shut down this eo shuts down the us refugee program for days halts immigration visas from those countries for days gives refugees who are in their nations religious minority from anywhere an opportunity for exception what part of that equates to a muslim ban theres no discrimination based on anything other than how dangerous the countries are according to dhs
nba,removed,youre not understanding a key point the third point states that religious minority is ground for an exception in those seven countries guess who are a religious minority its not limited to those countries and it is only grounds for refugee exception nobody can get a visa or migrate to the us from those countries no matter what religion the only way to the us would be as a minority refugee but you would have to be facing legitimate persecution you are mistaking the refugee exception my point with the immigration and visa ban my point so to recap for the next days anyone in the countries no usa refugees of any kind anywhere no usa refugees of minority religion maybe usa how is this anti muslim on trumps part remember weve established dhs not trump chose those countries
nba,removed,soooooo fuhhhhking saltyyyyyyy past my appetite for error haha how far past your appetite as far as seth currys dick goes down your throat
nba,removed,every single slightly witty and snarky tweet from a celeb about trump wins the internet these days
nba,removed,really carlisle was standing right behind the ref you retard he called the time out and the ref blew the whistle as quickly as he could he called time out before the steal you idiot
nba,removed,oh look a strawman i can play that game too are you more upset about the refugees not coming to america than our homeless vets if you care about refugees were you upset when obama sent cuban refugees back where you as vocally upset about obama dropping thousands of bombs on syria as you are trump choosing to house refugees in safe zones in sa instead of the us these are all bullshit arguments that dont have any relevance to the facts at hand we are talking about whether or not its a muslim ban if you dont think its a muslim ban like you said above why are you still here virtue signaling
nba,removed,lol with the steph flair go back to your bbq twist fritos and your call of duty and your mountain dew and your drake albums or whatever other mainstream ass shit you do

nba,removed,if youre going to take the post from our sub at least credit ujacjet for putting in the work and maybe also add the other important stats to back up the post heres what jac said about embiid by comparison james harden draws furthermore joel embiid commits pfg but because he has offensive fouls in games he only commits about defensive fouls per game as a result he only commits about defensive fouls per minutes an acceptable number for a rim protecting center that also means he will be fouled an absurd more times than he will foul defensively in an average minute period so on average a player would foul out to make up the difference in joel embiids fouling vs fouls drawn in a recent discussion of some unnamed competitor on rnba a criticism of joel embiid came up that he cannot defend without fouling it also appears that he cannot be defended without fouling a fucking shitload as a totally random example joel draws personal fouls per minute quadruple overtime bonanza if joel embiid were to play in such a game basically opposing players would have to foul out guarding him alone ujacjet

nba,removed,in the beginning there was darkness no twitter bots roamed the land and the neckbeards of rnba were subject to twitters shit video system which only worked about half the time so we pounded our mountain dew bottles against our desks and screamed reeeeeeeeeeee the cry shook the subreddit and one brace soul knew what needed to be done days later a mysterious hero emerged in the comment sections converting twitter videos to streamables the dark ages were over and peace settled across the land for a time as the offseason approached we leaned forwards in our couches in anticipation for the pinnacle of our shitposts our doritos forgotten but alas the unthinkable happened the hero who led us from darkness vanished despite the upvotes and praise we showered him with he had abandoned us when he needed him most chaos spread across the subreddit and screams of reeee were beginning to arise once more then just as twitterbot the first had saved us so did for a week or so twitter videos were converted to streamable and our reverence for twitterbot slowly faded replaced by our new hero but just like his predecessor suddenly disappeared as well for a short time this time however we were prepared no sooner had we learned of absence that a third saviour saved the day twittertostreamable the third hero of the prophecy had arrived however a few days into his regime arose from the ashes and the two have been locked in an eternal struggle to be the first to convert twitter videos into streamables at first it appeared as though the younger hungrier twittertostreamable would be victorious however used his experience to his advantage and the two are neck and neck posting streamables at almost the same rate only time will tell which of the two will emerge the victor and which will follow the path of the original twitter bot and fade into obscurity

nba,removed,why should he even begin to know who that old dude is ask nba players if theve read of malcolm x if they have listened to miles davis if theyve heard or read of marcus garvey how about haile selassie fucking paul mccartney when there are so many black heroes to question a player about and quiz a players knowledge about and this fucker chooses an old honky like paul fuckin mccartney im irish and not even i give a fuck about paul mc or the fucking beatles
nba,removed,id really like fucking these guys id get opened wide just humping up and down their dicks get wide opened
nba,removed,i think that dwyane wade
nba,removed,this is the most pathetic logic ive read and you should feel ashamed for posting this why are they moving zbo to the bench if everything is working so well the fact is the grizzlies style of play has weaknesses just like other teams that are not contenders props to the grizzlies for trying something different but it didnt workand their lack of playoff success even though they kept the same core together for a very large amount of time categorizes them as a treadmill team
nba,removed,we have no all stars gasol was an all star and get this zbo was an all star damn youre fucking stupid teams change youre right but one thing hasnt changed this clippers still have no bench and the clippers still cant play defense griffin is past his prime paul is past his prime wade is way fucking psy his prime and so is rondo guess what else bleacher report ranked us on a list of contenders only sas gsw uta somehow and cle were ahead of us were more of a contender than the clips and god save your piece of shit bulls team from finishing last in your division wanna talk about old and washed up your opinions mightve made sense four years ago when rose was winning mvps and blake griffin wasnt getting destroyed in the post on a nightly basis but now your unfathomable stupidity is almost inconceivable have fun winning thirty games you dumb thundercunt

nba,removed,i think theres a lot of racial baiting involved in a lot of racial conversationsstatements which anyone with a pulse would agree with this was somewhat of a racial statement i like that it didnt have anything nasty with it and was purely a show of unity which is what this country needs honestly id love a pair of the glasses youre wearing because i might be able to rewatch tonights game and see some defense
nba,removed,yes because the racial tensions mlk fought against are totally applicable today get real its and if you dont think unity and working together is the way to go youre going to be on the wrong side of history dont do that
nba,removed,blm blocking ambulances calling for white people to be murdered and riotingdestroying cities is creating a divide theres no other way of looking at those facts im sorry if that doesnt fit your bubble but its reality its and destroying property stealing looting and calling for white people to be murdered is simply not the way to voice an opinion but what happens when a significant portion of the country blindly defends the oppressor while condescendingly scolding the oppressed at every turn simply not true very few people disagree that there are bad cops slipping through training and screening processes and that needs to be fixed however calling for people to murder cops blm is not solving problems but just creating more and more
nba,removed,i never said you shouldnt complain because racial tensions arent as bad as they were in i said its a different situation racism is a problem in this country and i fully support you doing everything you can to help fix that problem as i think everyone should but rioting isnt the solution and will only create more problems obviously a cop that shoots anyone unjustly needs to be held to the fullest extent of the law and failure for that to happen needs to be fixed no one reasonable including myself disagrees with that my main point has been that supporting people hunting white people destroying their property or celebrating when a cop is killed are just as bad as the people that support cops that are obviously did something terrible blm riots arent remotely as destructive as the civil rights riots of the burning entire blocks looting and stealing while also supporting people hunting white people that a whole lot of racist violence to be not remotely as destructive i know i said racist but youre a white male there i said it for you like youve been saying things for me this entire time
nba,removed,three is not the number youre looking for and again i never said they were as destructive i said thats too destructive and is only holding things back honestly think what you want i support racial equality and have taken a lot of adult actions to get us closer to the goal of eliminating racism you clearly support violence against people because theyre white you decide where that puts you this is rnba and isnt the place for this and honestly if your only way of backing up your opinions is by making things up that you somehow think i meant when what i said is nothing close to that it means you lost
nba,removed,hey bro fuck off this shit is so dumb the nba will be in a lock out next year because its bad for business i understand this is your team but there is no way you can defend this is fun or good for the nba to watch guys win by every game

nba,removed,finals lebron had a terrible series of on with to per game he was also lit up and outplayed by tony parker when he tried to guard him who averaged ppg on the cavs defense also held the spurs ppg below their season average and duncan under so its not like lebron was completely without help in this series the spurs had or less in games game lebron pts on shooting rebs and assist to turnovers cavs only lose by game lebron pts on ast to turnovers cavs only lose by as lebron missed gametying game pts on shots shooting ast to turnovers cavs only lose by as lebron goes from the ft line deron williams averaged on against the spurs in the wcf with boozer as his only doubledigit scorer and the only reason boozer played well in utah was because of deron williams boozer has only once in his career averaged over ppg in a playoff series without deron williams when he had ppg against the nets in the first round so no excuse for lebron playing worse than deron williams against the same spurs team when williams only had boozer who showed up to play and boozer was only good because williams created his offense for him finals with dwyane wade averaging with spg and bpg on lebron still couldnt get the job done and was outscored by bench player jason terry while playing terrible defense the whole finals the heat defense also held dirk under to help out lebron lebron averaged ppg on in the season but ppg on in the finals an ppg dropoff which has to be one of the largest ever in finals history game lebron pts in quarter and heat only lose by game lebron pts in quarter and heat still win game lebron pts in quarter and mavs only win by lebron had pts the whole game game lebron in quarter and heat were only down with secs left before terry nailed the in the face of lebrons overrated defense to seal the game finals lebron only showed up for the first games of this series after game he was completely useless on both ends of the floor for the final games and was outplayed by ppg kawhi leonard over the last games which is completely unacceptable for a player of alltime lebron put up big stats but stats do not tell the whole story the majority of lebrons numbers were padded in garbage time after already getting blown out by games lebron scored of his points being down leonard scored of his points being up leonard outscored lebron in nonblowout

wade had with tos on but over the last quarters lebron had points and tos to wades points and tos the heat cut the lead from to without lebron after wade subbed in for him from the to mark of the quarter but even with that help lebron still lost game lebron had points in first half and the heat were blown out by at halftime he padded his stats from there and he did not score on leonard in the first half game lebron had fg in quarter mark to bring the heat within then he did not score again until the heat were down with in the lebron shot against leonard this game leonard clearly outplayed lebron over the final games even with lebron padding his stats and lebron failed to score consistently until after his teams were getting blown out lebron did not play well in the finals after game he only padded his stats lebrons finals was a repeat of the finals after game the only differences being that lebrons teammates disappeared along with him and lebron padded his stats to save face so any notion that lebron had an amazing series and still lost because of his teammates is false lebron failed his team over the final games and thats why he lost he did not contribute offensively or defensively the spurs did have great offensive execution in this series but a lot of that had to do with the poor defensive leadership of lebron who got exposed by kawhi leonard lebron also failed to play adequate defense in nba finals lebron was outscored in the finals by tony parker jason terry kevin durant all of whom increased their ppg and fg in he was outplayed by kawhi leonard over the final games as explained above and leonard shot when guarded by lebrons overrated defense for the series according to the article mvp leonard does it all and in he allowed andre iguodala to double his scoring average on more efficient shooting iguodala also had ppg on in the games he stared and he allowed barnes to shoot over on lebron despite shooting for the overall series was the only good defensive finals he had lebron is also on finals game winnerstyers lebron played very easy competition in his rings never beat an elite playoff team before has extremely poor finals performances in appearances and played poor defense in out of finals appearances if you dont think there are players that could win rings in his shoes you are kidding yourself

nba,removed,actually no my original comment was agreed with by many im very comfortable in my opinion and in calling a dozen or so people on this sub idiots
nba,removed,point shooting isnt a prerequisite at all for being a great nba player even in todays nba in his prime he was averaging roughly and assists while shooting he was so skilled and abused people in the paint he would be top player in the league right now easily this obsession with having to be a great shooter is ridiculous not a coincidence that all the best prospects going forward are all big men
nba,removed,if your whole judge of his defense is solely based on running through screens youre missing out on a lot he held almost every top guard in the league to less than their average fg all season hes doing it again this season but because hes still surrounded by such bad big men p n r defenders it makes it looks worse than it is
nba,removed,youre the one that said peyton and jeter were the goats in their sports lmao peyton is at best behind brady and montana jeter isnt even close are you blind or retarded

nba,removed,lol go fuck yourself internet comments do mean less than nothing if my comments offend your lilly ass then get off the computer and reevaluate your life
nba,removed,i hate the cavs a post essay sourced from rwarriors i truly just need to vent how much i hate that team everything about them the players the coach the jersey the fans the style of game they play against us the style in which they won the series last year fuck lebron this may get down voted but i just cant take it it fucking kills me seeing them beat us when i truly feel like they dont deserve it they are the galactic empire and lebron is darth vader they are the restaurant that forgets the bacon on your baconmac n cheese i still cannot believe they ended our run last yearfuckkk the cavs i want them at full strength in the finals i want a blood bath lets go dubs

nba,removed,i mean him being a shooter is obviously not going to last that being said he did improve his range a ton from year to year he went from for the future i expect him to range anywhere from for next year dependent upon where he ends up falling in our rotation this is a bizarre question for op to ask though for heat fans earlier this year who remember our games without dragic and richardson had to play he was downright awful a solid defensive player but he was horrendous and i remember people ripping him in our gamethreads it was only after the allstar break and more specifically the game vs golden state in miami where he broke out and went on a tear from land and took a massive leap
nba,removed,then get hivaids
nba,removed,dont be a cunt
nba,removed,yo question somewhat retarded want to try that one again in just one tense present or past your choice
nba,not_removed,drnasty
nba,not_removed,dr nasty am i just an idiot because ive never heard anyone call him that looking forward to seeing him make people fly air congo down there though
nba,not_removed,dr nasty did ibaka get a new career in pornography
nba,not_removed,no but i do think hell be great for the magic and the team will be better for it
nba,not_removed,he can shoot and dunk but he doesnt have a huge offensive presence and its a little late in his career to improve on that substantially but maybe he has some skills that i havent seen
nba,not_removed,who in the blue hell is that
nba,not_removed,hell be a third option at best just like in okc hes not going to suddenly flourish as a powerhouse two player because he changed teams ibaka has pretty much realized what kind of player hes going to be from here on out
nba,not_removed,tbh while i think his stats will increase in most areas i think he helps vucevic get past the borderline allstar level in a way its like how klay covers for curry on defense so he can light it up on offense
nba,not_removed,he wont be scoring per game if thats what you mean he will be a big contributor though also air congo or serge protector are better nicknames
nba,not_removed,too old
nba,not_removed,rarely does a year old make an immediate impact on a team
nba,not_removed,ive never heard anybody call ibaka dr nasty and i dont see him in his current form being a superstar it seems his best years are behind him
nba,not_removed,this post just canonized it i guess youre welcome orlando
nba,not_removed,never ever have heard ibaka referred to as dr nasty like huh
nba,not_removed,i question your okc loyalties
nba,not_removed,yeah vogels a superb coach i think he can do a ton with a player like serge
nba,not_removed,no thats pretty much it shooting dunking blocking shots hes not a passer and he has hardly any post game and if hes not open hes not taking the shot hes superb at what he does but hes basically a danny green
nba,not_removed,not sure at best vooch or him might be first option depending on gordons offensive development
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,his playoffs numbers this year and years ago were nearly identical no
nba,not_removed,they used to call him that in sportscenter back around or some when he first rose to prominence
nba,not_removed,this is how nicknames are born
nba,not_removed,that explains why it didnt catch on
nba,not_removed,because im still loyal to a player whos been nothing but loyal and amazing for us and i wish him the best
nba,not_removed,have you seriously never heard this joke
nba,not_removed,upvote but im guessing he meant because you didnt know they called serge that okc is my second favorite team i didnt know about that
nba,not_removed,i have but i think it is just that a joke some people think hes actually older than his age
nba,not_removed,yeah no
nba,not_removed,doc to kd we want you to fill our hole
nba,not_removed,lol in the city with state tax smdh
nba,not_removed,its the only pitch the clips have really outside of coming in saying with what ifs theyre laying it out up front obviously kd will want the money but being able to play with a starting line up of cp dj blake and jj could be rather appealing for him
nba,not_removed,⛵🔫
nba,not_removed,can kd cancel his meeting after reading this
nba,not_removed,what kind of pitch is that lmao
nba,not_removed,imagine a reddick kd blake dj lineup though
nba,not_removed,clippers you have got to be kidding me
nba,not_removed,take a pay cut and play with chris paul deandre and blake and in years ill give you half of my microsoft stock
nba,not_removed,kd is clipping them off his list
nba,not_removed,lmao wtf man give us a chance if you give them one wtf
nba,not_removed,needs to be one sizeable pay cut or they will be playing with a bunch of minimum salary players
nba,not_removed,who says no s
nba,not_removed,they would have a better chance at getting him if they did the opposite and asked paul griffin and jordan to take a paycut under the table of course and told kd they were going to pay him the max plus that under the table money
nba,not_removed,come to okc and make more money to play with better players and a better front office
nba,not_removed,hed get an easy threepeat too
nba,not_removed,youre all laughing now but la will have the last laugh when he signs there for the mle
nba,not_removed,dueces kd
nba,not_removed,well thats one heck of a super team if that happens tho
nba,not_removed,welp we tried guys were just happy to be here
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,those four plus reddick would be an insanely good team like nextlevel shit
nba,not_removed,clippers know that durant isnt coming and they dont want to upset one or all of their big three by hinting at a trade
nba,not_removed,itt people mad at the clippers for assuming kd will ask about their financial situation
nba,not_removed,breaking news kevin durant agrees to a deal with the clippers guaranteed to receive broken bobby pin an open bag of day old cheetos pennies and a pen with no ink
nba,not_removed,only a certain amount of teams get to have pitches with this dude and the clips are wasting it on this doc what are you doing no amount of xboxs pcs microsoft zunes are going to make it acceptable for durant to take a pay cut with no bird rights in a taxed state
nba,not_removed,at least consider it the clippers keep falling short and if kevin can get them over the hump i feel he will be celebrated to no end
nba,not_removed,im looking for the max cant do that but heres what i can offer you theres the door doc rivers i think you should see yourself out
nba,not_removed,kd dont even like chris paul as a person right hes dirty as shit plus that gif of him mad dogging durant after making a shot while durant was on bench and he responded with youre down
nba,not_removed,what a sweet offer for the clippers
nba,not_removed,im sure being in one of the biggest markets in the world on a great team has benefits also besides ballmer would absorb luxury tax for a ring i guarantee it
nba,not_removed,thats a great way to reel in a big time fa who wants money and a chance at a ring
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,i bet he walked out after they said that
nba,not_removed,fuck that yo
nba,not_removed,kd took dah plej to okc
nba,not_removed,warriors um we dont have that requirement
nba,not_removed,take a pay cut to play with these and no one else we cant afford a bench
nba,not_removed,so lets look at their cap for next year deandre and blake are making next season they then have money tied up in redick and pierce for they have some other cap holds and so the max they can offer while hanging on to their guys is really only at this time thats a solid pay cut and not just a minor one and that would be with them getting redick and pierce off the books
nba,not_removed,looks like im not killing myself afterall
nba,not_removed,clippers things
nba,not_removed,lol pass
nba,not_removed,i cant see kd in a clippers uniform
nba,not_removed,take a pay cut when the warriors spurs or thunder can offer you a max deal
nba,not_removed,he can play on a championship caliber team and get a max contact with okc
nba,not_removed,hi kevin my name is doc rivers and i won one championship with garnett allen and pierce and won playoffs rounds with chris paul and blake griffin
nba,not_removed,hed easily be the best clipper small forward since al thornton cement your legacy kd
nba,not_removed,send deandre jordan to okc
nba,not_removed,i do not get it at all he will not meet with the lakers who won a title in and have a great core of young players and tons of cap space and a great coach however he will meet with the clippers who have never made it out of the second round have had massive drama on and off the court for years limited to no cap space and a rapidly aging point guard
nba,not_removed,why would he ever sign with them okc has a much better team so do the sours and warriors
nba,not_removed,thats so clippers
nba,not_removed,put a little mescaline in the water and maybe hell sign
nba,not_removed,jj redick cant be thrilled about this
nba,not_removed,hes either going to stay in okc for money or go to gs for rings right
nba,not_removed,kek af
nba,not_removed,durant already makes most of his money from endorsements anyway moving to la in theory gives him access to a larger market but he is already a national endorsement figure being an mvp and a consensus top player in the world will do that no matter where you live but you have to imagine that winning a championship in a large market would raise your profile and with that your endorsement earnings anyway that clippers starting lineup of cp jj kd blake and dj would easily be the best in the nba and would arguably be even better and a better fit than a bos wkd or a gsw wkd lineup bonus of going to la over gsw is kd would be clearly the number option lead scorer and biggest star chris paul is an alpha dog personality wise but is a better facilitator than westbrook or curry or thomas im obviously biased but if im kd i seriously consider the offer knowing that id probably make up the salary in endorsements and if im cp blake dj and redick and i seriously consider restructuring all of our contracts to accommodate what kd wants to make again knowing that winning a championship lifts all boats financially so yeah kd is smart and it makes sense that he is taking a meeting with the clippers both from a basketball standpoint and a financial perspective but those godawful uniforms though
nba,not_removed,excellent sales pitch there ballmerrivers
nba,not_removed,this only works if blake and deandre all agree to restructure their contracts to take a pay cut as well nvm
nba,not_removed,lol so with the amount of money coming into the league next season durant is supposed to take a paycut yeah ok good luck clips
nba,not_removed,well that isnt gonna happen
nba,not_removed,plus california taxes hahahahaha
nba,not_removed,not gonna happen but that team would break the league
nba,not_removed,he should just cancel his meeting right now
nba,not_removed,clippers are out then
nba,not_removed,and your pitch goes down the drain
nba,not_removed,thatll be the pitch then theyll tell blake hes got a phone call in the other room and start talking sign and trade
nba,not_removed,ahahahaha
nba,not_removed,take a pay cut to get yelled at by chris paul for months and pay super high state taxes oh gee where do i sign up
nba,not_removed,the bulls melo pitchthat went sooo well
nba,not_removed,people are laughing at this but if hes serious about winning a title this could be very appealing i know he will have other options with contending teams so he will probably pass but think about how sick this team would be
nba,not_removed,atleast the clippers are going to get so sit with durant while the lakers arent and probably begging his agents to give them a chance at it
nba,not_removed,i was thinking maybe this type of pitch is geared at leveraging okc to do a signandtrade then i realized that the clippers president is a complete buffoon
nba,not_removed,if he was to take a paycut to join a contender he doesnt have to its make more sense to go to the warriors or spurs or even just staying in okc all teams are already better than the clippers
nba,not_removed,you guys can hate all you want but theres this whos betting against a clippers team with kd paul blake deandre and fingers crossed rivers
nba,not_removed,take a pay cut to be on a franchise that is out in the first round every year lulz
nba,not_removed,dumb fool rivers
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,ha
nba,not_removed,lol id néed a pay increase to play with dëandre
nba,not_removed,the only problem here is blakes clippers havent accomplished a damn thing
nba,not_removed,less money to watch chris paul dribble till the ball deflates and then yell at deandre i think he should pass
nba,not_removed,paid billion cant afford a top player
nba,not_removed,chris paul will never win a title he is just born as a fucking loser
nba,not_removed,another part to the pitch is that blake threaten to punch durant in the face if he doesnt sign with them
nba,not_removed,these are the clippers i grew up with utterly mockable
nba,not_removed,jordan needs to be the one taking a pay cut hes not worth anywhere near mill for years
nba,not_removed,hahah smh
nba,not_removed,jesus thats so clippers
nba,not_removed,honestly this is what the clippers have to say publicly but at the end of the day im pretty sure theyd send away anyone to make it work they cant really say their pitch is that they are open to trading one of the big because that immediately isolates those guys of which are on expiring deals
nba,not_removed,to be fair if hes just taking a one year deal a small pay cut isnt substantial in the long run
nba,not_removed,hey kevin do you want to get paid less for the privilege of playing with three of the most unlikable players in the nba
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,doc give this man a warm hand on his opening
nba,not_removed,til holy shit
nba,not_removed,its only that level for people as wealthy as durant so about of the state
nba,not_removed,yea seattle would have been nice for kd
nba,not_removed,bro fuck that shit plus fed and other bs im mad af over here of my paycheck goes to that
nba,not_removed,i fucking love texas no state tax is the shit
nba,not_removed,thank you this needs to be higher what else are the clippers going to say clippers dont have the cap space unless they clear like their entire bench or they trade one of the big but from the clippers fo thatd be an idiotic move to say theyre open to trading one of the big for a very slim chance at kd not worth pissing someone off
nba,not_removed,they have to move jj into a team that can absorb his salary without sending anything back in order to offer kd something close to the max otherwise they have to ask kd to take a per year paycut to keep jj which is a nonstarter so if this happened the clippers would be the big and the vet min im not sure such a lineup would actually work in the real world
nba,not_removed,you mentioned jji had to look up who else on the team you could be talking about but youre really pitching jj redick as a selling point i mean i respect redicks game hard nosed player with exceptional shootingbut i dont think kd gives a shit about jj redick
nba,not_removed,📎🔫
nba,not_removed,i think what some people are missing in this chase for kd is that teams especially the clippers are meeting with him in the event that he signs a then opts out after this year reenters freeagency in the same summer blake contracts are up and then the clippers already have a meeting of groundwork to build upon with him
nba,not_removed,kd should agree to the meeting but at the hour should cut off all communication then he should text doc and a picture of a chair with westbrook holding a contract obligatory fuck deandre
nba,not_removed,a pitch thats better than no pitch
nba,not_removed,i mean its all they got its kind of like if the sixers were to pitch something like hey we can pay you a fuckton of money to play basketball what do you say
nba,not_removed,the most clippers pitch possible
nba,not_removed,an arrogant one not too surprising that was their pitch tbh
nba,not_removed,one as successful as all their playoff runs in the past years
nba,not_removed,what im sure they also would be willing to send anyone else away this is just the first offer
nba,not_removed,thats literally our entire pitch like we would just tell him what the starting lineup is with him and offer a contract
nba,not_removed,him in the warriors lineup would be so much better
nba,not_removed,does it hurt to try though worst thing that happens is kd says yeah no thx and thats it not like the clippers have a ton of money to spend elsewhere theyre not waiting on kd before going out and pursuing other guys
nba,not_removed,worth a shot i reckon its a surefire way to a ring couldnt hurt to try
nba,not_removed,the clippers could also discuss scenarios in which they trade one member of their big three either to a team with cap space or to the thunder in a signandtrade its not their only pitch but i still dont like their chances even with a potential sign and trade
nba,not_removed,i c what u did there
nba,not_removed,him and harden would tear it up i really want to see it
nba,not_removed,haha living in la vs living in houston not even a question bruh
nba,not_removed,i mean if he takes a small paycut it would be just below max if we sent jj away then im pretty sure the clippers have a significantly better supporting cast around him westbrookadamsdipo
nba,not_removed,not true clippers roster is better also who wants to live in oklahoma lmao thats why most players live in la in the summer
nba,not_removed,most people would rather cut off ball than live in the shithole that is oklahoma
nba,not_removed,clippers bench is trash would be even worse if they got kd
nba,not_removed,ballmer can just slide in a few millions worth of microsoft stock over time i doubt anybody would notice
nba,not_removed,but im sure hes gonna go and join the warriors with ol dirty dray and the chest pounding manchild that is steph curry
nba,not_removed,haha
nba,not_removed,massive drama for years being the one time blake punched a guy and the owner who is no longer a part of the org being quasiracist sooo much drama
nba,not_removed,or stay in okc for money and rings
nba,not_removed,spurs are still in play i imagine
nba,not_removed,contracts cant be restructured unless its to pay the player more its why we were stuck with kobes big contract even once he was injured unless you mean they take pay cuts in the future although that wouldnt make sense for them considering bird rights
nba,not_removed,and blake can take smaller contracts next offseason since they are fa next year dj cant take a smaller contract till more years
nba,not_removed,just got word deandre is in oh wait now he says hes out give me a minute here ok so i called his phone but hes not picking up im gonna swing by his house nope no luck i think he was home but no one came to the door i think i mightve seen jj reddick peeking out the window
nba,not_removed,still smarter than your owner
nba,not_removed,yeah durant with paul deandre and griffin arent better than those teams i swear the things you people say
nba,not_removed,clippers are cursed and kd is cursed would two curses cancel each other out
nba,not_removed,so much ignorance
nba,not_removed,id rather watch my pg dribble down the clock then get the ball to me in a good spot than watch one who chucks up footers seconds into the shot clock while im wide open in the corner do you honestly think its more fun to play with westbrook than the greatest pg of the last years
nba,not_removed,do you not understand how a salary cap works
nba,not_removed,allnba team and alldefensive team yeah sure
nba,not_removed,i mean at least theyre getting a meeting hahah smh
nba,not_removed,kevin durant better have a swat team assembled in that new york hotel them clipper boys know a thing or two about barricading a hostage inside
nba,not_removed,but lac wouldnt have his bird rights and wouldnt be able to resign everyone next year
nba,not_removed,yes it is you max on your next contract is contingent on your previous one
nba,not_removed,except that and dj are two of the best liked guys among nba players at least off the court
nba,not_removed,i like
nba,not_removed,do you think that nba players have the same dumbass uninformed opinions about these guys whom they actually know and interact with as high school memelords on internet forums
nba,not_removed,thats the democratic party for you
nba,not_removed,isnt that effect muted a bit because taxes are paid where services are rendered maybe a tax accountant out there can clarify but i believe the case is that of an clipper players income is based on the home citys tax rate and is based on torontos tax rate based on houstons taxes etc
nba,not_removed,yeah man who needs roads and schools and shit
nba,not_removed,plus he has to pay his agent
nba,not_removed,the old people tax is killing me
nba,not_removed,but a high salesreal estatepersonal property tax its really a shell game
nba,not_removed,right its the pau gasollamar odom effect saying you want to get rid of them fucks them up sometimes and without a guarantee from kd its not worht it
nba,not_removed,jj as your best starter things could be far worse
nba,not_removed,jj would start on teams hes arguably the best spot up shooter in the league but he isnt one dimensional either his off ball movement is superb and keeps defenses distracted and when teams get overly aggressive in running him off the line he has developed the ability to get to the rim that being said the clips would have to ship jj out in order to offer kd a near max contract clips in this scenario would essentially be the big and the vet min im doubtful that such a roster could function effectively enough to win a championship
nba,not_removed,although all of them as starters require a body a double would open up a j or lob
nba,not_removed,✂️ 🔫
nba,not_removed,well i definitely missed the part where hey man take less money to play with three players worse than you are is considered you know groundwork
nba,not_removed,i wouldnt even be mad that would be so funny
nba,not_removed,he has to agree to a contract first verbal commitment
nba,not_removed,trust the process
nba,not_removed,the clippers organization just feels like a last second high school project to me especially their logo
nba,not_removed,all we need to do is get him into a room
nba,not_removed,not really if durant really doesnt care about the money and it would be only for one year as and blake could also do the same next year to allow durant to make more next year
nba,not_removed,i dont think its arrogant its a pitch that says we have pieces around you to facilitate a championship immediately the only reason hed even consider the clips in the first place is to win a ship not for the money i think hell be fine moneywise anyway with all the endorsements and whatnot im not too upset about it as a clips fan
nba,not_removed,i guess someone from the outside looking in would know
nba,not_removed,sorry guys we tried
nba,not_removed,also i thnk it was reported that the teams he is meeting with all think they have a slim shot so yeah why not try it
nba,not_removed,here is the thing though kd is a once in a lifetime player if you want that guy you dont fucking offer him a spot at a discount to you when you have long been a laughingstock franchise i could understand if pat riley in miami came with that sort of offer he would never but i digress but when you are the los angeles clippers get the fuk outta here with that power play bullshit kevin durant was last seen in the western conference finals the clippers have never been out of the second round and they want to offer him the chance to come and play with their team at a discount what
nba,not_removed,its a surefire way to a second round exit
nba,not_removed,im heating up bro
nba,not_removed,houston way cheaper to live in but i didnt mean in terms of living i meant cap space
nba,not_removed,texas has no state income tax though
nba,not_removed,or what if he signs for max to sign with stephklaybdd
nba,not_removed,but the benches tho
nba,not_removed,thunder are deeper and dont forget about kanter and the fa that we are going to sign
nba,not_removed,lol okc has a much better and deeper supporting cast not to mention it has a much better long term outlook la cant even afford to sign most of their bench beyond that la cant sign durant just below the max without moving more than just jj
nba,not_removed,homer here wbadamsdipo is better
nba,not_removed,i drove miles today in under an hour and saw the sun through my pollutionless sky havent heard a car horn in months someone held the door for me today i can piece together constellations in the sky i dont worry about gun violence or gangs just okc things
nba,not_removed,not true okcs roster is better people live wherever they want durant has no issues with oklahoma city
nba,not_removed,low crime smaller population lower cost of living low pollution housing costs are lower than the national average energy costs are lower than the national average people are more politeyes our politicians are assholes but that is the same in every state why wouldnt you want to live in oklahoma
nba,not_removed,our bench this year is not trash it is one of the best in the league
nba,not_removed,true
nba,not_removed,youd have to figure that durant would be an upgrade fit wise than blake doc has to cut bait on one of the current big to make a new one
nba,not_removed,tbh that would be more profitable than any salary offer durant could make
nba,not_removed,haha thats funnier than this post
nba,not_removed,do they have the cap space
nba,not_removed,obviously theyre better with durant but all other teams are already better than the clippers and it makes more sense if he were to take a pay cut to go to the better team
nba,not_removed,durant with a team thats literally been built around him is better than durant on the clippers
nba,not_removed,curses on curses on curses
nba,not_removed,ii think the next stage of basketball renders the point guard irrelevant if all or players on the court can create their own shots angles pick and rolls then whats the benefit of wasting all that time having a small guy stand at half court yelling and pointing at everyone you think griffin is pumped to get dumped the ball with seconds left on the clock for a footer that he could have gotten any old time
nba,not_removed,do you now understand what winning and luxury taxes are
nba,not_removed,flair up kid
nba,not_removed,he can call the if the clippers try anything shady
nba,not_removed,blake hodor griffin
nba,not_removed,plus wasnt it reported he wanted a year deal but still kd blake djdamn
nba,not_removed,yeah youre probably right but it makes sense for one season if im kd im only looking hard at okcgswspurs
nba,not_removed,are you actually upset we have amazing parks incredible public education in the uc system medical teachers with pensions beaches seriously so much good shit spread across a state the size of a country were also a state that makes the union work for every federal invested we give back i wouldnt blame democrats as much as id blame other states for doing little more than growing corn and playing football
nba,not_removed,you must have never been to california
nba,not_removed,i didnt come here to play school and thus i would not like to pay for them
nba,not_removed,damn he might as well quit the nba and get on rnba
nba,not_removed,jesus christ agents make of the players contract or am i reading this wrong
nba,not_removed,he could always drop him
nba,not_removed,california has a higher state sales tax than texas and while texas has higher property tax rates im not sure if the average person there pays more in property taxes once you account for the fact that property there is cheaper still plenty of reasons why i prefer living in ca over there
nba,not_removed,and texas is a literal disgusting shit hole compared to any other place in america so theres that
nba,not_removed,exactly last thing the clippers need is one of the big worrying about getting traded and then if kd were to never come youd feel pretty betrayed by the organization and itd create chemistry issues that would have never existed and i dont see this brought up enough but maybe the lakers dont attract fas as much anymore in addition to the fact that theyre horrible because of how they treated gasol dude was the number after kobe and was instrumental in bringing la more titles then in an off year he gets to have the pleasure of being trade bait for a whole season the way the lakers fo treated gasol was awful clippers dont need that rep
nba,not_removed,oh no i never said hes a bad player at alljust not sure if hes a strong marketing point for the pitch
nba,not_removed,im def not shitting on jj sounds like doc is trying to recreate a big of some sort for the clips like you said it would be tough to get all of them on the team and still surround them with enough parts to win the chip when doc was with the celts luckily rondo was making peanuts which allowed them to have depth and sign some vets
nba,not_removed,🍌🚤🗡
nba,not_removed,when all three of those players are top three at their position and can guarantee him a year to contend before he decides on a team for his max thats not a bad how many other teams can offer that sure its not the best team available to him but its at least a nice enough offer to hear them out
nba,not_removed,ok tell me a team that is saying him hey take less money to play with a player that is better than you considering that the cavs are not onto him there is no one who can say that
nba,not_removed,i dont actually think thats the pitch i think its if you sign a wed love to add you to our team once blakes contract expires next year instead of resigning him theres no pitch for this year for a lot of teams including miami for example
nba,not_removed,as a procrastinator myself im ok with this
nba,not_removed,still looking a hell of a lot better than the bulls organization going forward
nba,not_removed,mascot
nba,not_removed,have fun in the lottery next year
nba,not_removed,kd is a once in a lifetime player yes if you want that guy you dont fucking offer him a spot at a discount to you doc rivers might know more than you about this type of thing you have long been a laughingstock franchise with two top players and an excellent defensive center with an ace point shooter in jj the past doesnt matter when the team can compete with a championship winning coach to boot
nba,not_removed,rich talking about a laughing stock franchise coming from you
nba,not_removed,man shut the fuck up
nba,not_removed,laughingstock franchise sixers fan calling another franchise a laughing stock didnt the nba just step in and fire your gm
nba,not_removed,mavericks
nba,not_removed,i would gladly pay tax to live in southern california as an atmosphericclimate scientist i can tell you that as climate change gets worse and worse this will be one of the best places to be houston not so much
nba,not_removed,yeah gsw are the best choice roster wise but i was just talking about okc vs lac
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,the gap in starting lineups would be fucking huge westbrookoladipodurantkanteradams
nba,not_removed,i dont know about all that but your starting five wouldnt have shit on the clippers
nba,not_removed,you honestly think westbrookoladipoadams is better than and then you have redick who is much better than waiters
nba,not_removed,you didnt have to state that you were a homer your opinion and flair already show that
nba,not_removed,and when was the last time you saw a bunch of perfect walking around in tiny little bikinis all over the place women of socal women of okc
nba,not_removed,yea you havent been to la in awhile have you
nba,not_removed,i dont worry about gun violence or gangs me neither lol that was stereotypical as all hell can confirm la beats okc each and every day of the week source worked a few turnarounds in ponca greatest thing about okc is the thunder
nba,not_removed,tornados
nba,not_removed,well a lot of normal people would but if you have millions of dollars in your bank account where has the better places to spend it okc or hollywood restuarants clubs celebrities la la and la but ultimately i dont think thats a big pull for free agents though it is for other rich and famous people or else the lakers would have already rebuilt fwiw i have some friends in okc that ive visited there and thought it seemed like a solid place
nba,not_removed,i mean some of the things you listed probably explain why you wouldnt want to live in okc smaller population really doesnt mean squat larger population equals greater diversity greater variety of different cuisines cultures etc lower cost of livinghousing costs is a partial byproduct of the real estate market las so expensive because everyone wants to live there im not sure how you would quantify peoples politeness this would be purely anecdotal low crime is a fair point but once again there are many areas in la with low crime rates especially the places where i expect kd to buy a house just dont go through south central simple as that regarding pollution heres for the sw coastal area of ca where i expect kd to buy a house and for okc
nba,not_removed,i mean the good part is that its also near dallas so you could totally go to a cowboys or stars game in less than hours
nba,not_removed,i am always amazed by people boldly making claims that are factually untrue and easy to check
nba,not_removed,green not paul pierce was barely in our rotation at the end of the season
nba,not_removed,sure but he cant publicly state that in case kd doesnt sign with us then weve got a disgruntled blake to deal with all season
nba,not_removed,why the hell would the team announce they want to trade one of their stars just to get a slim chance at signing durant
nba,not_removed,if kd didnt shit the bed game and klay didnt have the most ridiculous display of shooting i have ever seen in a playoff game okc would have been in the finals are you denying that okc can compete with the best teams in the league
nba,not_removed,not by much though
nba,not_removed,it doesnt mean the team has been built to perfection
nba,not_removed,if all or players on the court can create their own shots angles pick and rolls then whats the benefit of wasting all that time having a small guy stand at half court yelling and pointing at everyone please find me one team with guys in the lineup who create their own shot if these teams are so common you should be able to name a few
nba,not_removed,i know exactly what the luxury tax applies the thing is that it doesnt apply if the cba literally will not allow you to sign a player since the clippers dont have durants bird rights they are barred from signing him over their cap do you honestly think that a team can have as much payroll as they want as long as they pay the luxury tax
nba,not_removed,no response
nba,not_removed,he flared you up enough just now he is excused
nba,not_removed,rekt
nba,not_removed,youre just an east coast byron scott that hurts
nba,not_removed,i need new episodes
nba,not_removed,the only team that can offer him years is okc
nba,not_removed,wins edit i know i did that wrong leave me alone
nba,not_removed,with jj at shooting guard that is almost a perfectly complementary lineup
nba,not_removed,they could still resign everyone but they still wouldnt be able to give kd a max next year when you factor in that hed have to be taking paycuts for the next years then suddenly it is substantial they could resign him over the cap though just like the cavs signed lebron last year
nba,not_removed,also knicks
nba,not_removed,why not boston
nba,not_removed,why would kd not be considering the celtics they have a good young roster and the only thing their team really needs is a superstar they can easily give him a max and hed be the guy on the team which is apparently what he wants plus its an extremely storied team and fanbase
nba,not_removed,california is dope on this i can find common ground with a lakers fan
nba,not_removed,the uc system is great in terms of performance but public funding for colleges isnt what it used to be under the original terms for the california master plan for education back in the and people could get damn near free college medical teachers and well funded public sector though is where a good chunk of the taxes go
nba,not_removed,wow get fuckin rekt hes just depressed cause hes a kings fan sacramento
nba,not_removed,for once i agree with a laker fan
nba,not_removed,that last sentence is perfffff
nba,not_removed,to add to that one of the reasons income tax is higher is because republicans took an axe to property taxes so the state needs to make up the difference somewhere if they hadnt done that our tax policies wouldnt be so lopsided and regressive
nba,not_removed,your beaches are fucking cold lol and they have nothing to do with taxes unless youre bringing in artificial sand
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,yeah but youre still sinking into the ocean
nba,not_removed,in the us federal govt collected more than trillion with a fucking t dollars and yet somehow managed to increase the national debt to over trillion usd california has awesome parks and beaches because of nature not because of govt spending tax dollars california spends more money on teaching kids and public schools than just about anybody what do we get dilapidated school buildings undereducated students and underpaid teachers more than of medicals budget goes to fraud and waste and most of the uc schools have dropped to the tier academically and they are still dropping fuck the democrats fuck the republicans fuck big brother government
nba,not_removed,because disagreeing with democratic fiscal policy never having been to california
nba,not_removed,now you know my story
nba,not_removed,nope nba agents are capped at
nba,not_removed,yeah i like my medicinal weed
nba,not_removed,it isnt but ok
nba,not_removed,gasol was trade bait for so long haha poor guy but yeah im sure no player wants to be told theyre being shopped and players around the league see that definitely think twice about those franchises
nba,not_removed,hes definitely not a lead off pitch its more you get to play alongside chris paul and blake plus deandre jordan down low and youll also have jj on the wing
nba,not_removed,banana boat dagger
nba,not_removed,if hes just looking for a team guaranteed to contend with for a year theres no reason to go to lac he has that already
nba,not_removed,the warriors can offer him that in currythompsongreenand they have been apparently trying to sell him on it all season okc can also offer with westbrookoladipoadams a very similar situation not quite as good as the clippers big three but the talent is there and of course the familiarity as well as the fact that they were one win from the finals ibaka for oladipo notwithstanding where he can find the best competitive opportunity is besides the point it just shows a lack of awareness in regards to the acquisition of stars you go out of your way to show them you are a good fit you dont offer them less than the going rate but this is the clippers they got the one star they currently have but didnt draft after the league vetoed a trade to the other la team they are entitled if it wasnt for the fact this was the clippers id actually have a hard time believing that an nba front office would make such a bad pitch
nba,not_removed,no other team is saying hey man take less money that is the point
nba,not_removed,tru
nba,not_removed,have fun not making it to the wcf again
nba,not_removed,and blake are both playmakers looks to get others involved over scoring blake can get his own bucket but will help try to get others easy buckets to say those two arent top talent is crazy
nba,not_removed,is a better playmaker than westbrook would ever be and thats a fact i would say that if he take a paycut and the clippers retain their big durant they would have a better shot at the title than okc plus he would be the main man the one who made possible for them to get to the title if he goes to gsw for example thats not how it would look thats currys team and he would get less credti for the eventual win
nba,not_removed,i think that it goes warriors okc clips for his best chances but and blake are very special players and the clippers are already a very good team
nba,not_removed,lol whats so special about and blake you mean other than one being the best pg of the last years and the other being a top pf in the nba
nba,not_removed,the past matters when you are asking one of the top players to come to your team for less money so he can win the clippers are currently good but not good enough to justify this approach
nba,not_removed,thats not relevant to this but if the sixers did something similarly arrogant i would say the same about them
nba,not_removed,man kiss my fucking ass
nba,not_removed,why does the current state of the have anything to do with the clippers i root for the team i dont run them have or have the clippers not been a laughingstock over their time in la
nba,not_removed,its not like he has to live in houston forever just the time he would play for houston and even then its not like he has to spend that much time there
nba,not_removed,gsw are the worst choice legacy wise
nba,not_removed,you underrate steven and overrate deandre just my opinion though not even saying steven is better
nba,not_removed,looking back at it i guess i am wrong here though jj will probably have to leave if durant goes to the clippers right
nba,not_removed,i mean i can be a thunder fan but not have a biased opinion on thunderissues all im saying is this statement is hella biased and i guess reddit doesnt like my opinion
nba,not_removed,i can almost see them in their tiny little bikinis now let me just jump so i can see over the crowd of homeless in the way
nba,not_removed,i went just a few weeks ago and everything he said checked out
nba,not_removed,thats because you had to go to ponca city lol that place sucks tulsa and okc are legit though
nba,not_removed,damn you win
nba,not_removed,the cowboys suck
nba,not_removed,no good clipper
nba,not_removed,westbrook and kd both shit the bed
nba,not_removed,you can make any shot in the game out to be a crucial shot i saw the same argument for gs when they said if curry made more shots they would have won it i could also say if lebron made that dunk it wouldnt even have been that close okc got outplayed and thats it they definitely had a chance though
nba,not_removed,im laughing at your certainty sure they could but they literally havent ever done it so im not sure where your confidence comes from
nba,not_removed,the writings on the wall at this point i just hope he doesnt think he sees greener pastures through the window
nba,not_removed,couldnt a team sign and trade so kd still gets a five year deal or did that go away with the new cba
nba,not_removed,boston can
nba,not_removed,you fucked that shit up harsh fam
nba,not_removed,after noah how are they gonna pay him
nba,not_removed,and hed be the guy on the team which is apparently what he wants says who
nba,not_removed,well he is considering and has interest in the celtics thats why hes meeting with them ultimately i think he is staying with okc for another year or so
nba,not_removed,honestly with the blue and gold plan the gi bill and the number of public and private scholarships its very very close to what it was in the and its just that less people serve more people go to college from very rich families and due to population increases to get the free money you have to write essays and fill out paperwork agree on the rest
nba,not_removed,gsw or lakers kings but i spent a number of my summers in sacramento growing up fishing hunting lighting fireworks with abandon lots of angelinos and bay area folk would do well spending a summer slowing down in sacramento lake folsom is amazing the great american river is fun as hell tahoe isnt too far go bond with nature but also you can take a shower
nba,not_removed,i live across the street from staples center i knew reddit was liberal leaning but not like this holy shit
nba,not_removed,proposition was a voterapproved initiative it wasnt a bill passed by republicans also that reasoning doesnt really hold up to scrutiny californias property tax rates arent that high but when you take into account the average value of property californians pay more in property taxes than the national average and on top of that both our income and sales taxes are the highest in the country though i think for sales tax it depends how you to define it and whether or not you include local sales tax regardless ca is still near the top
nba,not_removed,jesus christ this is rnba not rthedonald lets talk basketball people
nba,not_removed,thank you lakers homie for dropping wisdom
nba,not_removed,cost of living standard of living i can basically go to the beach daysyear barely ever have to wear a sweatshirt and look at gorgeous women all over the place if someone offered me to live in any other state i would turn it down
nba,not_removed,checks username
nba,not_removed,source
nba,not_removed,endorsements are unlimited and traditionally much higher however
nba,not_removed,steers and queers
nba,not_removed,it absolutely is
nba,not_removed,it definitely says a lot especially since it was gasol it essentially says no player is safe from that type of treatment
nba,not_removed,shit is wade lebron and gabrielle union ok
nba,not_removed,i agree i was just explaining how the clippers big three could be appealing
nba,not_removed,i agree i dont think he leaves okc unless he just wants a change of scenery but if he does leave the clippers make the most sense outside of golden state
nba,not_removed,okc can also offer with westbrookoladipoadams a very similar situation not quite as good as the clippers big three but the talent is there westbrookoladipoadams
nba,not_removed,ok but the fact is if they are using this meeting to make ground work for next year they can grant him more money considering that balke and could take a pay cut in the next summer so it is not a bad idea in the end if he wants to leave to sign for a team that will give him a better chance to win he would probably give up on a max contract it is not news others players have done it before unless he decides to go to gsw but that in my opinion is not going to happens if he is worried about his legacy and wants to be remebered as the man who brought the team to the title gsw have won without him and is curry team
nba,not_removed,its just so funny how this is the only thing people can say about the clippers oh you guys have been good for like years and you havent made it to a spot that only teams make it every year you guys are so bad
nba,not_removed,a lineup would be deadly
nba,not_removed,he didnt say they werent top talents he said that the thunder and warriors have just as much to offer in terms of talent
nba,not_removed,doesnt take dumb shots and that makes him better player overall
nba,not_removed,i just find it funny that a fan of a team that the nba literally had to step in to save them from their overwhelming incompetency would be making fun of another franchises history
nba,not_removed,the same dj that just got team all nba and team all defense
nba,not_removed,deandre is very good and even if so is better than adams so the clippers are better at every position but point guard and thats arguable
nba,not_removed,unless they want to fill the rest of the roster with minimum contracts jj would have to go
nba,not_removed,i mean djadams griffindipo even if westbrook is better than it does not nearly make up for the other gap in talent
nba,not_removed,legit sure better than la nah not even close lol
nba,not_removed,true fuck the cowboys but id still go to a cowboys game just to watch some damn football
nba,not_removed,kd missed the last crucial shots tho if he wants to blame anyone he blames himself
nba,not_removed,i still dont see him wanting to sign a year deal it would make no sense and he would end up being worse off than taking the price cut for year with the clippers
nba,not_removed,ol clicheking up in this bitch
nba,not_removed,it cant be
nba,not_removed,noahs signing isnt final yet also it was a joke
nba,not_removed,still dont know why people think sac town is a shit hole its super nice unless its a week with an average of which we sure have been getting a lot of this summer
nba,not_removed,wonderful things to do all over the state unfortunately most people prefer to spend their free time bragging about themselves over social media
nba,not_removed,he sounds more like a rconspiracy type of person to be honest
nba,not_removed,found the cuck kidding cant wait for this election to be over
nba,not_removed,read it as vagran twade then saw your comment reread it now i feel stupid
nba,not_removed,but it was due for some increase under a forbes article which might as well not be linked since everyone has adblock and is too to deal with that
nba,not_removed,why tho
nba,not_removed,minnesota sucks because all the hot girls move out of state when theyre old enough to do so
nba,not_removed,now of course if basketball reasons never happens the move makes sense and everyone loves the lakers again
nba,not_removed,dj cant make his free throws he cant play in close games adams can do that advantage okc blake and are better than oladipo and westbrook but if you were ranking the four westbrook comes out on top right also oladipi is young and is another year older it isnt as big of a gap as you make it out to be and if you had to pick one trio to play with for the next years it would pretty easily be okc
nba,not_removed,so the plan is to offer less money this year and then next year more money because the current stars of the team will take less that doesnt make sense blake and can resign last the team can pay luxury tax on their contracts so any pay cuts from them would be purely voluntary to help ballmer out in the pocketbook not gonna happen there is no groundwork laid by offering him less money all it does is show kd that they think he needs them and not the other way around you want to talk about groundwork here is some kd you are the best player in the world we need you we will do whatever it takes to bring you to la just let us know what that is and likely kd says okay cool does his thing with a year and then next year the clippers sit down with him and say the same thing only this time they add blake and are free agents do you want to play with them we can sign one or both or whoever you like that is groundwork
nba,not_removed,dont talk shit if you gonna get salty
nba,not_removed,wouldnt they have to drop jj in order for any of this to work
nba,not_removed,if you look at both rosters without durant the clippers clearly have more talent to offer than okc
nba,not_removed,im not making fun of them i am seriously critiquing their thought process of offering kd less money to play for them if they had championships it would be one thing you could say well you cant argue that this is a franchise that knows how to win that is why i could see pat riley saying something like this to kd it is basically the equivalent of a ring drop only its blake and deandre falling on the table and not championship rings i cant see it working out one of the major reasons i cant see it working out is the clippers track record as a laughingstock its hard to turn down an ultimate winner when they make you a good offer easier still when they make a bad offer when a loveable loser makes you a bad offer pretty easy to turn it down
nba,not_removed,what no if the clippers wants to sign kd even at a paycut jj has to go we cant fit all contracts
nba,not_removed,okay fair but id argue and again feel free to disagree with me that wbadams could but does not surpass cpdj if the playoffs are any indication of what wb and adams could be they could easily become the best point guardcenter in the league on the other side while and dj are very good as a combo can you see them getting any better and im obviously a massive griffin fan so all ill say with that is that im holding off any judgement on dipo until he gets to play next season for all we know he can be amazing or a flop at okc
nba,not_removed,never said they were better but comparing ponca city to okc isnt fair lol
nba,not_removed,its likely that his foot injuries have prompted him to get some security hes not lebron cramps arent considered his most severe injury
nba,not_removed,i mean we said the same thing about draymond kwahi and ad last year and they all took long deals
nba,not_removed,were on edge right now
nba,not_removed,he was just joakim guys
nba,not_removed,sitting at home with the lights off playing when yosemite is right fucking there
nba,not_removed,are you illiterate
nba,not_removed,dj cant make his free throws he cant play in close games holy shit has nobody watched the clippers play in years why do people still think this is true he does not get benched in crunch time and he hasnt since vdn was coaching he plays every game when its close late so you can go ahead and throw that argument out the window if you were ranking the four westbrook comes out on top right the difference between westbrook and is close enough as to be negligible an argument can be made for either one as the second best pg in the league right now redick is much better than dion waiters at the blake is miles better than whoever the hell is going to be playing the for okc now that ibaka is gone and dj is inarguably better than adams and seeing as he just got team all nba and team all defense it is a consensus the gap is absolutely as big as i made it out to be if durant leaves who is the thunders second best player adams
nba,not_removed,that last part is exactly what theyre doing do you really think doc is saying take less money in their closed door meetings of course hes not doc uses the media to say manipulative shit all the time there is no pitch for this year for the clippers just like there is none for miami take less money is just a doc red herring why would he say that bc if he doesnt then it means hes saying hes willing to trade or blake right now for kd which opens another can of worms and speculation a lot of teams expect durant to be a free agent this year and next year and are starting their pitches now for durants free agency when they can sign him over blake or
nba,not_removed,lol and then the standard reddit response y u so salty can you think for yourself at all
nba,not_removed,theyd only have to drop jj and most of their bench to offer him close to the max if he is taking a substantial pay cut they dont need to get rid of jj
nba,not_removed,they would probably drop jamal crawford
nba,not_removed,wasnt defending him just clarifying his point
nba,not_removed,oh christ no absolutely we had to drive all the way to okc on our days off for any sort of fun i fuckin hate ponca lol money was good tho
nba,not_removed,you only have to worry about san antonio or golden state
nba,not_removed,okay fair enough i watched a handful of clipper games this year maybe i didnt pay enough attention to how often he was on the court at the end of close games hes still an offensive hindrance late and adams is not which was my point i made it poorly i would never have argued for adams over jordan until this years playoffs he was amazing in all three rounds and really made a name for himself april i was taking jordan today give me adams if durant leaves oladipo is the second best player and adams is the third the clippers do have a better team than the thunder if you remove kd i stand by my contention that it isnt as big of a gap as you say and i also think that okc has a better year future i know you never said anything about the future but when it comes to free agency it has to be considered
nba,not_removed,hopefully they are saying exactly that to him it would be pretty remarkable if they werent i was only responding to the tidbit that said that it wasnt and again if this were not the clippers i would have dismissed it outright
nba,not_removed,can you not start wanting to cry when presented with the fact that you are taking a massive l rn
nba,not_removed,jamal is an ufa
nba,not_removed,also knicks
nba,not_removed,dj is a huge threat on pick and rolls diving to the rim hedge off him to the shooter for even a second and he has a dunk
nba,not_removed,so you were more impressed by a player you actually watched than someone you didnt watch thats some hard hitting analysis right there hes still an offensive hindrance late you continue to just make up things that are false he is not a hindrance late quite a few of the clippers most effective crunch time plays end in easy alley oops to dj at the rim but you can go on pretending that a guy who scores a game on shooting is somehow a worse offensive player than a guy who averaged a game on shooting and you continue to ignore that dj is the best defensive center in the nba as for the future its not a guarantee that the thunder are better positioned if they underperform in the playoffs again westbrook might very well leave in free agency and the team is no longer a contender
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,ok guys this one took my nearly hours from translating and typing the stuff so i apologize before hand for any typos and my english hope you enjoy

nba,not_removed,the french rejection
nba,not_removed,theres literally two
nba,not_removed,youve never watched a nuggets game
nba,not_removed,ever watch the wolves in the last few years
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,hayward ingles withey still a dumb comment though
nba,not_removed,withey wasnt on the floor at the time thats what i thought he meant
nba,not_removed,oh makes sense
nba,not_removed,tried to get phoenix curry but had to settle for new orleans curry
nba,not_removed,like what good does that do admitting it now
nba,not_removed,good try vlads
nba,not_removed,jokic nope booker nope hield yep
nba,not_removed,they could have drafted him
nba,not_removed,devin booker is in phoenix nice job vlade
nba,not_removed,suns fans would you guys want a bookercousins trade
nba,not_removed,you got curry tho
nba,not_removed,swing and a miss by divac
nba,not_removed,instead they got the next steph curry
nba,not_removed,its okay at least curry is a nice consolation prize
nba,not_removed,big like klay check shoot like steph check
nba,not_removed,why would you say that if i was buddy id be a little pissed off at my gm calling me his option
nba,not_removed,im pretty sure he just went down a list of best smiles in the nba
nba,not_removed,guys im not that dumb
nba,not_removed,i think hes trying to justify the value he got for cousins hes been saying i offered cousins for insert young player and they still turned me down and no gm has argued with him so far
nba,not_removed,booker at wouldve been a stretch but based on viveks obsession with warriorsesque players i wouldnt have been surprised if he had drafted him there
nba,not_removed,for me no id rather have booker and see what develops id do brandon knight len a
nba,not_removed,its not a stretch he went in tons of mock drafts and mock drafts dont mean shit the only thing that matters is how the team rates the player and if the team rates booker as the number prospect on their board then its not a stretch to them to pick him at
nba,not_removed,he punched steve kerr once during practice and kerr punched him back thats dedication
nba,not_removed,there was no letup even during practice wennington recalled he jordan was percent all the time pushing everybody and challenging everybody and going at guys from the get go he was really focused on what needed to happen and what he was going to do himself but also the guys around him who were taking time off he kind of let it be known the only reason you didnt practice was if you were dead or at least couldnt walk i remember one day being the last getting taped and im in the locker room and were going to start in or minutes wennington related ron harper and toni kukoc were in the training room and had let it be known they werent going to practice while im getting taped michael comes in and says harp what are you doing he said his knee was a little sore im sitting out today michael says heck with that get on the floor we dont need you in here then he looks at toni and says whats wrong with you toni says my hand my thumb hurts michael says no we dont need either of you guys in there we dont need anyone in here we need you out there unless you cant walk you are out there they got up got taped and got out there that was kind of it for everyone you didnt sit out practice unless you were injured badly if you sat out you werent playing talk to a lot of guys and theyll tell you our practices were harder than the games wennington added competitive every day pushed ourselves every day not two hour practices shorter later in season but had an edge and competition james edwards was with us that season even he knew this was special he said when he was in detroit with the bad boys they played hard but it wasnt like this pushing every day and working it
nba,not_removed,mj bulking up after losing to isiah
nba,not_removed,from his college days there were several reasons the – campaign would fall short of expectations six weeks before the season started jordan broke his left wrist he practiced anyway with a cast on practice with the bulls in their time alone with him however the team was adjusting to a new undercurrent of contempt kerr was stunned at the way jordan seized control of the entire teams mental state for better or worse we had no idea kerr said he was so intense and condescending in many ways none of us felt comfortable on a daily basis he would just dominate practice not physically but emotionally and in an intimidating fashion he was going to make us compete whether we wanted to or not you know theres certain days where its like youre an nba player and youre exhausted every team goes through this theres just days and youre gonna go and get your shots up but you just need your rest and michael doesnt need rest he doesnt sleep even today he doesnt need rest and other guys do and so on those days when people were tired he would ridicule us and cajole us and you know just yell at us it was tough it was hard to deal with quotes from roland lazenby michael jordan the life
nba,not_removed,after being eliminated by the magic mj made the whole team practice throughout the offseason
nba,not_removed,i heard a story that mj made a deal w swackhammer that hed become an attraction at moron mountain if toon squad lost to the monstars and he won w a pair of bunnies and bill murray as his sidekicks
nba,not_removed,it is well documented he trains incredibly hard in the off season after eliminated by the pistons and magics and he came back mightier than ever before
nba,not_removed,i once heard he didnt make his high school varsity team and it pissed him off
nba,not_removed,he sure worked kwame brown
nba,not_removed,mj bulking up after losing to isiah
nba,not_removed,the espn for on his baseball days was actually very good on the kind of dedication he had i actually think he would have made the majors eventually if he hadnt decided to go back to basketball the kind of dedication he had made other professional look at him with awe and any pro is by nature is a hard worker
nba,not_removed,steve kerr looks like dash from the incredibles
nba,not_removed,lol sounds similar to skiles and shaq which resulted in skiles hurting his hand in some way
nba,not_removed,that seems more like a story of him being a bully than work ethic
nba,not_removed,thank you looking for more like these
nba,not_removed,bad boy pistons
nba,not_removed,then what happened
nba,not_removed,steve kerr looks like ellen d
nba,not_removed,joking
nba,not_removed,he became goat
nba,not_removed,what happened next will shock you
nba,not_removed,howd he turn into kareem
nba,not_removed,he became kobe
nba,not_removed,pretty sure he isnt lebron
nba,not_removed,lebitch is only the goat at flopping
nba,not_removed,expected coming from a bulls fan whos been fucked by lebron for years
nba,not_removed,its jamal bro not jamaal but i think hell play for another years he isnt as good as alot of ppl think he is alot of the times hes one reason we start losing leads and other times he can bail us out imo he shouldnt be a man on any team but hes a solid bench player when used properly
nba,not_removed,hell retire in a year or two he still looks reasonably healthy but his stats have been declining recently
nba,not_removed,i dont know about the nba but jamal is going to be crossing up young guns at the ymca even when hes years old the man just loves basketball that much
nba,not_removed,id also like to see him play til
nba,not_removed,about more years left theres a chance he could extend his career by being a catch and shoot man but hell probably call it quits before then postplaying career i could see him being an occasional studio analyst on espntnt and continue being the man in the seattle basketball scene watch for him to try and snag a prominent role when seattle gets its nba team back
nba,not_removed,oh my fault thank you
nba,not_removed,hes playing out his contract i think then hes retiring
nba,not_removed,i hope if the sonics come back he has a role with the team
nba,not_removed,hell be making million a year at that point
nba,not_removed,why are you guys paying him that much for that long
nba,not_removed,definitely deserves it he and his friends seem to be the ones keeping prohoops alive over there
nba,not_removed,thats about as much as hed be paying in medical bills
nba,not_removed,¯ツ¯
nba,not_removed,hes been something of a mentor to a lot of seattlearea players just the kinda guy you want working with your team imo
nba,not_removed,¯ツ¯
nba,not_removed,if youre implying a travel you should probably read the rules regarding a gather step durant took steps after he picked up the dribble
nba,not_removed,i think i speak for everyone when i saywho the fuck is nick wright
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,yeah its always weird to hear before this year the now cause i mean times his team was the best or second best team to me he wont rank higher than jordan i think hes gonna need rings and i dont see it but i have already in my tier with jordan wilt kareem russell where if someone says i think of those are the greatest ever i cant argue it its too hard this is what to me lebron has over jordan tho whos more valuable thats lebron hes the definition of valuable i dont think theres ever been a player that did more with less than him when he was carrying those cavs teams to wins and making the finals at like starting a team id go lebron but if i have a talented team but they cant break through cause theyre just missing a go to scorer like the hawks or celtics or utah then mj
nba,not_removed,i agree as well sucks he compared them by age tho which is a bit dishonest
nba,not_removed,i think the reason lebrons finals record is criticized is because for all but one of them he went with a self assembled super team that included two other franchise players lebron had the whole not not rant that made it championship or bust for these teams i think the principle of what this guy is saying is right but i think hes missing the point jordan has done more than lebron has at this point in his career if you look at games played i dont think that rules lebron out of passing him i just think it will be very hard im looking forward to watching lebron try to pass him it will be awesome especially now that he has the perfect villain in gswdurant if you want to show greatness you take the hardest road and get there anyway edit extra word
nba,not_removed,nick wright is an awesome dude i always like when he fills in for colin
nba,not_removed,i agree with the idea lebron has the right to aim to pass him every player does but this guys a tool also bringing up the wrong points comparing them at a certain age when lebron came into the league younger lebron actually has played more games than jordan not including the wizards years not many people seem to realise how short jordans career was also the whole miami thing is stupid they were heavily injured the year they missed the playoffs the argument is dumb though i agree with that
nba,not_removed,i looked at thumbnail and thought it was ginobili
nba,not_removed,i agree with this guy but its important to remember that jordans are what separates him from the pack so saying lebrons on track is really really impressivebut winning another peat as the leader in your is what separated jordan from everyone else in the first place also did cowherd say lebron was the under dog in of that doesnt sound right he had to be favored in and at the very least right regardless i agree with pretty much every thing this guy said but id emphasize jordans were incredible
nba,not_removed,wright says the eastern conference is weak every year because of lebron which is simply not true it is weak because the conference has less talent and produces only one realistic championship contender each year the west typically has realistic contenders every season if lebrons heat and cavs teams had to go through a combination of san antonio oklahoma city dallas la and more recently golden state its extremely unlikely lebron would have made the six finals appearances that he has the only realistic championship contender lebron has had to go through in the east were the bulls with preinjury mvp derrick rose also many of his playoff series against these lesser eastern conference teams went seven games suggesting he would have had a lot of trouble getting through the gauntlet of the west when you factor in the superteam asterisk i think that it is more than reasonable to say that the age comparison with jordan is still not close
nba,not_removed,i live in houston and this dude always has the most lukewarm takes also he only covers basketball and football so you would think he would have some insight but the best youll hear out of this guy is zach lowe rehashes
nba,not_removed,there were strawmans and assumptions about the projordan camps train of thought in this rant what a heap of complete garbage
nba,not_removed,this is just a video skip bayless needs to watch
nba,not_removed,any person building a team and takes lebron over mj is an idiot imo
nba,not_removed,nick wright is a huge douche bag he also said a whole lot of nothing in this video
nba,not_removed,who
nba,not_removed,i think what people forget is jordan missed years from the time he was drafted to his absolute final retirement if you take his averages and apply them to of those years broke his leg year so i wont count it and have jordan play a minimum of games a year jordan wouldve finished with at least more titles most career points with at least closer to more scoring titles and he already has that record with most career steals more nba first team all defense and he already has that record with probably one more regular season mvp to tie kareem significantly more career playoff points currently has that record what im saying is if jordan would have not retired three times there would be zero argument who the greatest is lebron would have no shot to get close to those numbers and he started his career way earlier than jordan now imagine if jordan started his career at years old and apply them to the five retirement years hes the goat for what he did and what he couldve done
nba,not_removed,two of those finals losses were with the stacked heat so his argument about finals losses is moot
nba,not_removed,to me it just boils down to this think about how difficult it was for lebron to get the rings he has right now and then he has to get more to match jordan thats why to me jordan is still far ahead of lebron but its true that when you compare age to age lebron is ahead
nba,not_removed,i would also like to add to nicks argument about the weak east theres a lot of fallacious arguments about this topic from the standpoint of basketball history magic played in a western conference that was weaker than the eastern conference lebron has played in since no one can even name a great team the lakers beat in the western conference finals during the the best team they faced was houston in and they lost but when discussing magic johnson nobody brings this up the idea that a players accomplishments dont matter because of the conference they played in is a very recent argument that people started making specifically to downplay lebrons accomplishments furthermore people confuse the fact that the western conference is stronger than the eastern conference with the eastern conference being weak this is also fallacious reasoning just because the west is stronger than the east it does not therefore follow that the east is weak the west from is the strongest conference of all time from a historical standpoint such strength in a conference for so long is abnormal but people are so used to it that they treat it as the norm thus they start erroneously believing that if the east isnt comparatively as strong that the east is therefore weak
nba,not_removed,people dont penalize lebron for making the finals they penalize him for losing in the finals granted he was on the team i like when he lost of them but honestly he should have played better in and the rest of the team should have played better in if you get to the finals you have to prove youre really the best and win them otherwise yes its better for optics if you dont make the finals if you dont clearly have the best team in the league but to say its ok to get to the mountaintop and then get shoved off its not ok thats why lebron is penalized for being that being said even if he was he wouldnt be considered in the same class as jordan like this guy is saying jordan started years older than lebron if jordan had more years to rack up numbers rings and mvps hed be blowing away lebron at the same age in their career better to compare them at the same experience level years when jordan completed his year he had rings and was
nba,not_removed,lebron only brings it up for brand exposure and get his name continuously out there people get mad and worked up lel
nba,not_removed,a writer from houston that got hired to fox on cowherds recommendation he fills in on colins radio show from time to time editradiohead as well
nba,not_removed,for a second i thought it was nick young and was disappointed
nba,not_removed,hot take merchant
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,just curious what do you think about the of polled gms who said theyd take ad instead of lebronkd as the franchise player a few years back obviously ad isnt anywhere there in terms of accomplishments yet but is there good reason to think hes worth as much as lebron to build a franchise around
nba,not_removed,but why lebron has probably had the greatest high school career in the point era jordan needed his college years to develop into the player he was careerwise lebron reached greatness at an earlier age than jordan why shouldnt we consider that a factor when comparing them
nba,not_removed,everyone talks about how hard it will be for lebron to pass jordan but just realize they are essentially asking lebron to do the sameslightly less than what jordan did jordans chances of winning another ring let alone entering his age season same as lebron now looked pretty grim the bulls looked much worse in without him than they had before and even with him back they had lost to a young up and coming magic team scottie was turning and the new addition in rodman was anything but a sure thing having been shipped out of sa for chemistry issues mj had proven he was still good but was he still the goat remember he had retired to play baseball for almost years that is kind of unprecedented also if you look at the competition things didnt look good for the bulls houston had just won back to back titles and was retaining their roster as already discussed orlando was a young up and coming team that had just beaten the bulls the knicks and pacers looked strong in the east entering the season the bulls were merely in the mix the fact that jordan entering this situation and managed to again is nothing short of miraculous and is why he is the undisputed goat a rare thing in most sports if you compared year old lebron to year old jordan legacy wise lebrons is clearly better of course in order to surpass jordan will require lebron to be incredible in this latter chapter of his career however it will only mean doing the same thing jordan did
nba,not_removed,i agree the narrative might be a lot different had lebron stayed in cleveland and still had the same finals appearances but like you said he joined a selfassembled super team but the video says lebron was the underdog in all but of his finals appearances that doesnt seem true at all
nba,not_removed,lebron being good enough to come out of highschool is not a knock against him staying healthy isnt either youre basically penalizing him for being that good at he made the finals in his year mj didnt until his age vs age to knock him for being great enough to dominate the league earlier than mj is silly
nba,not_removed,a shorter career is less impressive than a longer one not saying lebrons is more impressive than jordans currently but jordans career being short doesnt help his case
nba,not_removed,fair enough
nba,not_removed,we were favoured in we were the underdogs in every other year we made the finals
nba,not_removed,youre saying western teams are stronger than eastern teams lets assume thats trueit is if lebron played in the west hed be on a western team by logic his team would also be stronger strength is all relative an eastern team vs other eastern team is competitive a western team vs another western team is competitive please judge on fair ground and not on bias when you make your argument
nba,not_removed,in he lost to the celtics in who then go on to beat the lakers in so logically he would have gone to the finals im in and by the same logic he loses to the lakers he loses in to the mavs still wins the next two loses to gsw and then beats them and then wins the finals against the raptors so now hes instead of and if we thrown in a little luck and he manages to get past the lakers one time or the mavs then hes thats still really good
nba,not_removed,think of how many teams rebuilded or broke their cores just because they got ousted by lebron in the playoffs chicago indiana boston atlanta even philly and brooklyn all went into rebuilding mode because they were unable to get past lebron lebron is actually one of the reasons the east is weaker because franchises gave up on trying to beat him
nba,not_removed,how many times has it been said on this site for dude cant be beat im a jordan fan and i believe he can never be topped but come on man thats accurate
nba,not_removed,to be fair lebron was already good entering the nba jordan wasnt the player he was in he became mj when he stepped in the nba
nba,not_removed,im pretty sure he said alot basically hes saying people criticize lebron for losses in the finals when in reality to make it that many times is an amazing feat also at the age of michael and lebron career are pretty similar
nba,not_removed,get your ears checked bud
nba,not_removed,lol you cant just project like that what if lebron averaged his feb numbers throughout his whole career with steals per game on from the field and from deep well he didnt and you cant just say that mj would be putting up those numbers in all the seasons he missed he was resting during those seasons and it helped him for his second peat and you cant blame lebron for not getting injured or not quitting basketball for baseball
nba,not_removed,heat were not stacked in the spurs were the favorites if i recall
nba,not_removed,stacked you mean lebron wade and bosh with a couple point shooters it worked twice but those teams were thin
nba,not_removed,what about the warriors choking in the finals with an even better roster than the heat ever had
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,people who think those teams were stacked are delusional
nba,not_removed,it wasnt easy for jordan to win rings in fact not many people expected him to win again after the poor showing in orlando in playoffs
nba,not_removed,agree jordans legacy is better at this point simply because of total rings not because of finals
nba,not_removed,firstly ill actually debate you rather than downvoting not what its for so sorry about that and secondly my actual points a what you say about the mountaintop is true but the point hes making and that should be made cos its valid and unquestionably true is that its better to reach the top and get shoved off than to get shoved off the bottom b had jordan not gone to college or played baseball his career wouldve been totally different yes but maybe not in all the more counting stats ways people say he wouldnt have developed the same maybe better maybe worse we dont know he wouldve had more wear and tear probably retired earlier may have been drained later in his career postbaseball ring years i also personally dont think jordan wouldve put up lebron numbers at the start of his career because hed be more like kobe not the ridiculous manchild freak lebron was out of high school
nba,not_removed,fox on cowherds recommendation no thank you
nba,not_removed,pretty sure he is a radio guy and not really a writer he was on kc radio for a bit before going to houston
nba,not_removed,sounds suspicious dunno if i buy it
nba,not_removed,so his job is to replace something fundamentally superfluous
nba,not_removed,i think they were thinking ad just had steals blocks per game season per blocks in the playoffs hes only and bron had the back problems wasnt as efficient kd missed most of the season had a terrible foot injury also they were probably thinking next years who do i want i would have gone kd next years but ad wasnt like a shocking choice after the season he had
nba,not_removed,most gms are not very good thats why there are so many bad teams
nba,not_removed,he specifically said lebron has more counting stats at the same age which is sort of ignorant because lebron has more seasons because he came into the nba earlier
nba,not_removed,jordan in his senior year of high school averaged supposedly to go with rpg and apg lebron his senior year averaged ppg and jordan by all accounts was ready to play in the nba its just skipping college back in jordans era was seen as a bad move that hurts development players also in that era more often stayed at college for multiple years not due to inability to play in the nba it was just something players did skipping college was completely unheard of until kg did it in a move that at the time was heavily critiqued you can make an argument that lebron will end up having a better nba career in terms of accomplishments but that doesnt help decide who is the more talented player
nba,not_removed,if jordan got into the nba at and started wrecking there hed have conservatively more points more rebounds more assists hed have developed earlier into a stone cold killer that would probably have gotten him past detroit earlier and then would have still dominated the league from netting him potentially rings by age the rest of his career would be a bit hazy i think hed not retire and win more ring closing out his career with rings and far higher career numbers and retiring at instead of
nba,not_removed,lebron being good enough to come out of highschool is not a knock against him staying healthy isnt either youre basically penalizing him for being that good at also penalizing him for not taking almost seasons off to go fuck around in another sport people gave lebron shit for taking weeks off to get himself fully healthy but apparently leaving for multiple seasons is perfectly fine
nba,not_removed,so then jordan not losing in the finals is not a knock against him either losing in the finals is a knock you get there and you lose it means you werent the best team in the league and i fully realize that includes heat teams
nba,not_removed,no im not its just career totals are not the reason mj is considered the goat so an argument based on that wont achieve anything lebron has a good shot at having a better total career but to me goat is about how good a player you are
nba,not_removed,what the health technology and methods they have the last years far exceeds what the players had in the and in the future when many players in their are still playing due to more advancements on technology would you say the same thing to me mj is the classic ferrari raw as heck but drove to perfection and changed super cars still one of the most impressive and best cars of all time lebron is a gtb huge mighty engine but has a heck of a lot of advancement in engineering to make it great i would gladly have both love them but if i have to make a choice which car i want give me the only that jordan is still actually better than lebron people need to realize jordan was the best scorer and top at worst defender at the perimeter all his days he was also super as an overall player on elite percentages and shur down defense is once in a lifetime thing i throughly enjoy lebron james game he fills up the stat sheets like the best of them to me his best trait is his ability play heavy minutes and be effective and energetic all game if he and mj were on the same team and i was coach i would make plays with lebron getting the ball to mj because i know mj will deliver lebron is pretty much a modern pippen with a better bigger body that allows him to withstand more bangs play multiple positions etc he is a bigger and stronger pippen basically with better slashing ability due to his size and thats not a diss as pippen is top favourite players of all time
nba,not_removed,it does if youre arguing on based on career totals like this guy is
nba,not_removed,it does when lebron has been playing longer and is still catching up
nba,not_removed,its easy to beat go like robert horry did
nba,not_removed,that line of thought gets debunked in literally every single fucking debate that takes place on reddit between bron and jordan edit its even getting debunked in this very thread and im still getting downvoted incredible
nba,not_removed,jordans competition in the east was much stiffer than the competition lebron played through the past years also people forget the lebron narrative of him jumping ship and linking up with wade and bosh which at the time was soon as a huge shot at his legacy but has seemed to be forgotten not to mention he did choke in the finals which isnt even up for debate
nba,not_removed,im not your buddy guy what did he say that was so revolutionary in this video hes not the first person to say that jordan gets too much credit for the years that he lost before the finals
nba,not_removed,saying what if lebron averaged his numbers is not counter pointing my argument that would be like me saying if jordan averaged his finals numbers for his career i said take jordans career averages and apply them to games for years even if he had all career lows in those years his numbers are still ridiculous there is no way jordan would go from ppg and drop to ppg in the first retirment years he won straight scoring titles retired came back and won more youre saying he wouldnt have won it the years he missed doubtful he was still in his prime now the retirment years absolutely his average drops but its not like he wouldve averaged ppg jordan wasnt jordan when he played for the wizards but he wasnt a terrible player he became the only player to score over points in a game being at the age of after all as for the titles almost every sports radio host writer and television host would say the same thing no one was stopping those bulls teams they wouldve beaten the rockets the only advantage the rockets had was hakeem no one on that rockets team could slow down jordan we wont have to project what lebron couldve done we will all witness his greatness but as great as he is no one has ever dominated like jordan but god damn we just witnessed the greatest nba finals of all time and the greatest finals performance from a player no one will ever top that run from lebron not even wilt dominated like jordan or even lebron wilt was a footer dominating guys when he faced other foot guys he kinda choked a little i could never call wilt the best when he was one of the worst free throw shooters ever
nba,not_removed,werent stacked in either mike bibby and dampier were getting significant minutes miller and haslem were injured most of the year werent stacked in either it was pretty much the wade and james show in the playoffs theyd take turns with the ball what made the heat elite was their suffocating team defense theyd go on a stretch where theyd completely dominate that end to blow the other team out
nba,not_removed,and so were the thunder in and so were the spurs in out of our finals appearances we only were the favourites entering one and we lost
nba,not_removed,exactly lebron will never be better than jordan
nba,not_removed,jordan was in the finals
nba,not_removed,yes my point wasnt that jordan had it easy its that lebron still has a lot to accomplish before he can match jordan i didnt bring up the difficulty of jordans rings because we all know how that story ends
nba,not_removed,yea my bad he had a few reads but hes mostly radio his wife is pretty cool they still live in houston till his kid finishes this year of school nice couple
nba,not_removed,lol he just appears on the show from time to time until his own come out
nba,not_removed,this is true
nba,not_removed,exactly if you compare them by experience seasons to seasons jordan smokes lebron in rings mvps etc
nba,not_removed,thats a huge if
nba,not_removed,he claims he did that because his father was brutually murdered and his lifelong wish was for jordan to play baseball theres conspiracy theories it was for other reasons which we can never know for certain if they are true but if its for the reason he claims it is you can hardly blame him in saying that lebron taking weeks off to get healthy is fine to me if he needed it especially in this era but you cant blame jordan
nba,not_removed,losing in the finals is a knock you get there and you lose it means you werent the best team in the league so you prefer your goats to settle for being the or best team instead of why the fuck would making the finals be a knock because you werent the best team while losing earlier in the playoffs is not
nba,not_removed,agreed but its pretty interesting to compare mj is goat for many reasons but its fair to say at age lebron and mj arent as far apart as it would seem this coming from a lebron hater dude has earned respect and his career needs to be viewed for what it is top all time imo
nba,not_removed,ok but you cant knock lebron for coming early into the nba and dominating when jordan couldnt even do that kobe tried but he was on the bench because he wasnt ready regarding how you view goat lebron does everything on the court and is his teams best everything jordan never had to carry that much rodman was his best rebounder and maybe best defender pippen was the best facilitator and defender ive never seen a guy that dominates the flow of a game like lebron does that includes mj and magic magic is up there in terms of game control but he doesnt have the defensive prowess lebron does
nba,not_removed,never said lebron was better jordan so i dont why you chose my post to argue that all things else being equal a shorter career is less impressive than a longer career i really dont think this a controversial statement and we dont even know for a fact that lebron will play for a significantly longer time than jordan he could retire after this season for all we know
nba,not_removed,for the first years of his career lebrons best teammates were mo williams only two years and zydrunas illgauskas lets be fair lebron is playing catchup but thats mostly because of the quality of his teammates for the first half of his career with comparably talented teammates from lebron has been to the finals every year and won half the championships
nba,not_removed,first you said people dont make that argument now youre saying people disprove that argument when its made those are clearly very different points projordan people do make that argument and it gets debunked as you say in other words its not a strawman and people get pulled up on their bullshit for saying it so youve contradicted yourself what is the point youre trying to make here
nba,not_removed,debunked by who and how whats your debunking what is your argument to debunk it
nba,not_removed,also people forget the lebron narrative of him jumping ship and linking up with wade and bosh right because ive never heard anyone bring that up in an argument between the two players before
nba,not_removed,i dont think he was making a new argument just putting in his two cents which is kind of these dudes job lol
nba,not_removed,hes not the first but its not really the common narrative i think its slowly changing though aa lebrons career progresses what i do agree with what he said was his point about the eastern conference it really has been a right off solely due to lebron
nba,not_removed,heres a tissue bud
nba,not_removed,im not arguing jordans greatness at all im just saying that jordan didnt do those things and thus cant be credited for them once you go down that line of thinking it becomes a slippery slope i could just as easily say that lenny cooke would be an nba star today and should deserve credit for that
nba,not_removed,thats nice for jordan but your team went and then lost biggest choke job in sports
nba,not_removed,but that isnt fair either lebron was only years old one of those season rookie year old jordan should probably be ahead of rookie year old lebron and year old year veteran lebron should be better than rookie year old jordan neither way is completely fair although it is worth noting her that we admit that at the very least lebron was better than jordan at the ages of
nba,not_removed,its not that jordan should be blamed the problem is when people blame lebron for weeks to get healthy when completely giving jordan a pass for taking years off to get healthy mentally
nba,not_removed,lebron got to enjoy an easier road to the finals as a heat fan watching years of lebrons career it was obvious there was no real competition in the east and it continues on now that hes in cleveland if jordan had such easy roads to the finals hed probably rip off trips to the finals also the main difference is hed have won all of them because he was always able to raise his game another level to overwhelm any finals opponent
nba,not_removed,i can understand that its just lebron not going to college is part of why thats the case which is a bit unfair to jordan considering the attitude towards not going to college of jordans day vs lebrons
nba,not_removed,im not knocking lebron for it im just not knocking jordan as he didnt have a chance rack up stats before as he chose to go to college that was considered the smart thing to do at the time not going to college was way more uncommon in jordans day vs lebrons day kg broke that mould in and at the time he was heavily critiqued for it as everyone believed that not going to college kills development its not always as simple as his teams best at everything meaning best player lebron was only the best rebounder on his team during the heat years because the one real big on their team was playing in a perimeter role other than that when lebron has played with better rebounding players like love or tt he is no longer the best rebounder im happy to admit lebron is the better passer and rebounder but scoring and defence at the end of the day are the most important things a player can do and jordan was objectively better at both of those things now in saying that thats what i feel makes up the goat if you feel differently thats your call my post was mostly about me disagreeing with why he thinks lebron has an argument i think there are other arguments to make for lebron better ones than he has more counting stats by age
nba,not_removed,thats a terrible argument jordan had equally shit teams in the beginning of his career besides youd think with the amount of stat stuffing lebron would do playing with shit teammates would catch him to mj faster but it hasnt
nba,not_removed,i understand im just saying what could have been just like what could have been if shaq and kobe stayed together or if shaq and penny hardaway stayed together or better yet if lebron wouldve went to ohio state i think he wouldve won an ncaa title along with the multiple player of the awards
nba,not_removed,this thread was about jordan and lebron you idiot
nba,not_removed,while the people blaming lebron are in my opinion wrong the situations arent really comparable if you felt that way anyway why did you say go fuck around in another sport as if jordan just did it for a bit of fun
nba,not_removed,you didnt even come close to answering my question if you think losing in the finals is a negative because it means you were not the best team in the league why do you think proving that you are the best team in the league is better
nba,not_removed,im happy to admit lebron is the better passer and rebounder but scoring and defence at the end of the day are the most important things a player can do and jordan was objectively better at both of those things i dont think you can say jordan was a better defender lebron can guard positions at an elite level jordan could guard or theyre both incredible defenders but it isnt so clear cut
nba,not_removed,the same reason people claim lebron took weeks off to fuck around in miami and party one of them should not be penalized while the other is praised for the move
nba,not_removed,he perfectly answered your question though
nba,not_removed,defensive versatility does not equal defensive ability he also cant guard all positions at an elite level he can switch onto them and guard well but he cant lock down all positions over the course of a game which is what you need to be elite at all the last time i remember lebron trying to guard a big over the course of an entire game was against david west west shot from the field with lebron on him and lebron didnt guard him at all for the rest of the series he was simply not big enough as much of a monster as lebron is to effectively guard the post against a guy like that in the post that doesnt mean lebron is a bad defender in fact hes a great defender he just cant guard at an elite level at an elite level provided its not a post and not im not saying it is clear cut just that jordan was a better defender over the course of his career lebron was on jordans level during his heat years but outside of that he wasnt really on that level that doesnt mean lebrons not a great defender just that jordan is consistently better
nba,not_removed,youre just being incredibly hypocritical if you really believe both of them are right then why do you need to bash jordan at all for it if this is really how you felt your comment shouldnt of even been made at all in the first place no one in this thread was penalising lebron for taking weeks off those weeks off are never even bought up these days i saw some stuff about lebrons weeks around the time he did it but after he came back and proved it was beneficial to him no one really bought it up anymore aside from a few crazy people he was critiqued at the time because the cavs were struggling and he seemed to abandon them looking back though it was the right move no one praises jordan for the move either most people think in hindsight it was one of the biggest wastes in sports history people just dont hold it against him because they know about his tragic reasoning for it
nba,not_removed,why are you commenting on my comment from months ago
nba,not_removed,if youre only looking at lebrons defending youre looking at it wrong lebron is so good at team defense be it through helping off his man to get steals getting chasedown blocks on the fast break etc
nba,not_removed,i phrased it very poorly i will admit that but i constantly see people claim that jordan would no doubt have won rings in a row if he hadnt played baseball while completely ignoring the impact that a year and a half playing baseball instead of basketball had on his ability to recover physically and mentally i guess my problem is with the type of people who like to claim that lebron is not even in the same universe as jordan its typically the same people who say that jordan will never be surpassed ever no matter what possibly could happen
nba,not_removed,i just saw this as i was browsing and i just want to comment
nba,not_removed,im not looking at it just like that jordan was a beast off ball as well difference is jordan was a lot better at fighting through screens and chasing his man off ball weakest part of lebrons d
nba,not_removed,ok i can agree with that i dont think he would of won in a row either i also believe jordan can absolutely be surpassed and will be someday
nba,not_removed,httpiimgurcomxxeoofygifv
nba,not_removed,pretty crazy how he cant get an nba spot anywhere
nba,not_removed,why does everybody go to the guangdong tigers are there no other teams in china
nba,not_removed,damn im almost sure he could find a roster spot if he wanted interested to see his statline in china
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,all hail to stephon marbury for being the one to start this movement
nba,not_removed,boozers first order of business figuring out how to say and one in mandarin
nba,not_removed,ni hao ni hao
nba,not_removed,holdat
nba,not_removed,he bout to average
nba,not_removed,boozers chinese nickname is fan gu zai translation
nba,not_removed,i wanna hear him yell and in chinese
nba,not_removed,yi jianlian and carlos boozer might be the softest and least physical frontline in basketball history lol boozers gonna ball out in china though ready to see some crazy statlines and grainy highlight vids
nba,not_removed,i dont get it tho if a contender wouldnt take him why not just take a solid string contract with anyone who needed a vet presence than going all the way to china
nba,not_removed,how much do the top chinese teams pay compared with european teams
nba,not_removed,did it for the ladies
nba,not_removed,in chinese hell yes
nba,not_removed,have fun getting minutes there you goober
nba,not_removed,how much is he going to be making cant find the numbers of the deal anywhere either way someone should have picked him up to come off the bench met boozer at animal kingdom in florida chill dude
nba,not_removed,guongdong idk i feel like draymond should sign there
nba,not_removed,i have this sneaking suspicion hes going to earn a suspension for yelling at a teammate to grab a rebound forgetting his teammates name and then blurting out grab that shit ching chong
nba,not_removed,boozer enters gang bang
nba,not_removed,carlos boozer wants better hair products so instead of buying made in china hairspray hes going straight to china so they can spray it on his head right after they make it guangdong tigers setting themselves on the right path to get carlos loozer to set them on the right path to the first cba pick the next yao ming must be one year away
nba,not_removed,is he really this bad now
nba,not_removed,breaks hand opening door punches ref in balls with same hand classic boozer
nba,not_removed,this is a gem
nba,not_removed,he wanted to risk holding out for a championship team and this is the result
nba,not_removed,boozer is still nba quality most of the people we hear about on this sub are nba quality so if you hear about them going to cba theyre probably going to the bestrichest team
nba,not_removed,they are one of the highest paying clubs in the world
nba,not_removed,money
nba,not_removed,not cba finals mvp for sichuan blue whales and memphis grizzles great hamed haddadi
nba,not_removed,i dont know maybe guangdong is better networked in the us than most of their competition in reality formernba players play for plenty of other cba teams blatche beasley marbury etc and guangdong isnt even the dominant team in the league
nba,not_removed,their like the lakers of cba im guessing
nba,not_removed,if there were no other teams what would the competition be
nba,not_removed,probably lmao
nba,not_removed,hes pretty terrible at this stage in his career
nba,not_removed,you mean hold that shit
nba,not_removed,and one in the native language 和 一
nba,not_removed,working on his mandarian cantonese
nba,not_removed,lol you win
nba,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking lmao
nba,not_removed,victory lap victory lap
nba,not_removed,zhou
nba,not_removed,i mean yi jianlian and anyone else is a pretty weak ass frontcourt
nba,not_removed,because boozers motivation has always been making the most money he can not winning
nba,not_removed,adding onto the other guys post boozer played with lebron in his first year probably had an inkling lebron was going to be something special when the cavs released him to sign him to a new contract he left for the jazz imagine those lebron teams from only with boozer in prime allstar form on them cavs probably get to another finals and lebron doesnt leave cleveland but yeah as the other guy said money at this point in his career its probably rings before money but if he cant get rings hell go where the money is
nba,not_removed,wasnt he holding out for a championship team contender to pick him up im sure some team wouldve taken him if he was available to everyone
nba,not_removed,i know you got downvoted to hell but this would not surprise me in the least
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,well he might get his wish southern tigers are pretty nasty over the last years
nba,not_removed,he should go to cleve oh wait
nba,not_removed,no salary cap
nba,not_removed,i feel like this is a sentencebut i just dont understand it
nba,not_removed,yo hamed is a beast he played well when he got minutes
nba,not_removed,i think you could say that historically guangdong is the most dominant they made the cba finals every single year from to years in a row and won of them and have been in the playoffs for every season since the leagues inception maybe not the most dominant as of right now but might help explain why some people feel its quite wellrepresented in terms of foreign players coming to the cba
nba,not_removed,theyre
nba,not_removed,im
nba,not_removed,who actually answers rhetorical questions
nba,not_removed,per game
nba,not_removed,lol google translate its 加一
nba,not_removed,mmmyes
nba,not_removed,its for the benefit of the other team though so mandarin would be a safer bet
nba,not_removed,points at kenny i know chinese
nba,not_removed,yi jian lian is chinas best player lmao
nba,not_removed,yi jianlian and prime shaq
nba,not_removed,eh its been one of those days on reddit where you just cant buy an upvote shit happens you roll with it ive lost like karma today
nba,not_removed,all i know is there is a limit on international players for each team
nba,not_removed,everybody goes to the guangdong tigers but not hamed haddadi who is an mvp for the sichuan whales and a former grizzlies great
nba,not_removed,i care so much
nba,not_removed,armpits
nba,not_removed,heat fans
nba,not_removed,me
nba,not_removed,gimme dat shit wang
nba,not_removed,hell be turning one month into the season thats retirement age
nba,not_removed,yeh and i think the whole phrase is 小帳加一。
nba,not_removed,yeah i would say 加一 would be more appropriate as its add one vs 和一 meaning and one where 和 is used as for example i want a b and c or something like that my cantonese is terrible
nba,not_removed,points and boards on shooting last season for yi jianlian dude is balling out in the cba
nba,not_removed,i mean if youre good enough to make it to the nba and put up decent numbers youre gonna ball out in china
nba,not_removed,and
nba,not_removed,i feel like their league would probably grow a lot more quickly if they took that limit off let the best come and compete and up the entertainment value and let their own players develop alongside the international players
nba,not_removed,correct spelling is important bromuscles
nba,not_removed,why did this get so many downvotes
nba,not_removed,pwned
nba,not_removed,you should care proper spelling will help you seem like less of a dolt
nba,not_removed,you have to understand a lot of redditors have developed this image of themselves as super intelligent as a way to rationalize their poor social skills and without any real accomplishments that someone who is actually smart would have they need to use things like grammar on the internet to feel superior
nba,not_removed,so heat fans
nba,not_removed,get that shit zhou
nba,not_removed,yes retirement in the nba for an nba player players can go a little further than if they have a game as a smaller guy or are a big boozer doesnt rely on athleticism so he can definitely still give good minutes in the nba the difference is hes going to the chinese league hes going to be one of the best in the league over there
nba,not_removed,stephon marbury is god there at age boozer will dominate china
nba,not_removed,i think the foreigner limit is just more of a domestic pride than anything
nba,not_removed,hairy ball sack
nba,not_removed,reddit loooooooves there grammer
nba,not_removed,or people can take minor corrections in stride and just learn and move on jebus defending people who double down on their ignorance when corrected is silly they are letting an oversensitive ego get in the way of selfimprovement through learning
nba,not_removed,no me
nba,not_removed,i didnt say he wouldnt be good in the chinese league i was saying he why hes not good enough for the nba
nba,not_removed,yeah but were talking about why he didnt make an nba roster here
nba,not_removed,ball sac sacks are for sandwiches sacs are for plants and animals
nba,not_removed,it is highly unlikely that he didnt know the right word to use it was almost certainly a typo or just from rushing and lol lets not pretend like he corrected him out of concern for his knowledge or self improvement
nba,not_removed,they also have to have the need to bring it up when nobody asked
nba,not_removed,so heat fans
nba,not_removed,except he most likely is we put up solid stats with the lakers im sure he could at the least be an end of the bench guy somewhere
nba,not_removed,im sure he could have gotten a roster on one of the lower teams
nba,not_removed,whatever the motivation of the one doing the correcting deciding to own the mistake is a kind of proud antiintellectualism that helps nobody
nba,not_removed,no me
nba,not_removed,why did he go to china if hes good enough for the nba its not like china is paying out huge salaries in the cba
nba,not_removed,i bet he got offers but none that he really wanted prob on the cheap and lower level teams as a mentor type guy and maybe he thinks he can produce beyond that bet he got a nice check for signing in china though plus a garaunteed starting spot
nba,not_removed,no one is owning it no one is saying its correct but everyone knew what he meant and it doesnt matter its not like hes actually teaching anyone something sorry to get in the way of you all jerking yourselves off
nba,not_removed,i imagine he went to china just to have fun playing ball hes going to have to work really hard just to barely get minutes if he goes to an nba roster that can go anywhere or else he gets stuck on a tanking team like when he played with us when you have that much money i imagine spending the remaining years of your ability to play competing for a championship or dominating is much more appealing than sitting around on a bad team feeling miserable
nba,not_removed,yeah but the post above mine said he didnt make an nba roster which would definitely not be true
nba,not_removed,you are a crude vulgarian without a point if you want to go on defending the willfully ignorant i can live with failing to have convinced you of its dafitude
nba,not_removed,most guys dream of making the nba if youre already in and proven yourself then i bet its a different mentality when you just want to play and not linger on the end of the bench
nba,not_removed,yeah i was in agreeance with you just because he left the nba doesnt mean he cant make a team
nba,not_removed,lol is this satire i cant even tell
nba,not_removed,jabari parker over favors millsap klove porzingis and ibaka okay
nba,not_removed,millsap and love are both definitely better than parker
nba,not_removed,wait youre serious about parker
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,for real though
nba,not_removed,not a single mention of derrick favors
nba,not_removed,for me its anthony davis draymond green blake griffin paul millsap derrick favors after the top it gets real muddy and aldridgeporzingisboshloveibaka could all stake a claim to those spots
nba,not_removed,anthony davis draymond green blake griffin lamarcus aldridge kristapas porzingas
nba,not_removed,anthony davis draymond green paul millsap blake griffin lma
nba,not_removed,jabari should be
nba,not_removed,jared sullinger bitches
nba,not_removed,gimme ad blake lma dray millsap
nba,not_removed,griffin durant he can play power forward melo he too can play power forward dirk howard along with durant and melo howard can play power forward
nba,not_removed,i put milsap
nba,not_removed,favors too
nba,not_removed,as crazy as it sounds yes this video is talking about next season yes im aware that jabari wasnt one of the best this season but just on how he performed after the all star break i can see him doing major work this season but hey who knows i can look back at this months from and look like a complete idiot we will have to wait and find out
nba,not_removed,really smh rn i should have included him
nba,not_removed,no lma
nba,not_removed,draymond over a healthy blake no aldridge in the top favors over love and a healthy bosh
nba,not_removed,how could you even consider millsap over griffin
nba,not_removed,you got it
nba,not_removed,lol what the hell might as well call curry the best shooting guard in the nba going by this logic
nba,not_removed,only of those are pfs edit you editted but howard can not play pf hes too slow durant and melo are sfs who play smallball pf which is entirely different
nba,not_removed,the fuck is this sht griffin the only one what is right durantwrong position by that logic i am gonna answer that lebron is the best pg sg sf and pf even if he would be pf he is way too weak melothe same thing but he actually plays it sometime and is strong enough but still dirk is too old top all time pf imo dwight cant be a powerforward in modernday nbawhy you would even put him as a one
nba,not_removed,the fuck no lebron
nba,not_removed,even porzingis averaged more ppg too
nba,not_removed,is good but without much defense or ability to stretch the floor to the point line hes still probably at best for pfs let alone top
nba,not_removed,no lma and he has green over griffin thats just straight up bullshit
nba,not_removed,just finished the video haha i guess great minds think alike nice job on the video i liked it
nba,not_removed,what do you mean
nba,not_removed,this
nba,not_removed,durant does play the sometimes actually though not nearly enough to be in these rankings
nba,not_removed,aye mein u tryna call me a shit tit
nba,not_removed,o shet u right bron knock howard out
nba,not_removed,jason kidd said he has been working extremely hard on his point shot if that is true then i can see him performing way better
nba,not_removed,i am taking green over griffin
nba,not_removed,thank you means a lot
nba,not_removed,saying that players like durant melo and dwight should be part of the best power forward rankings just because they maybe have the ability to play power forward is kind of silly i was comparing it to ranking curry with shooting guards because he has the ability to play shooting guard
nba,not_removed,yeah id hope hes working on ititd be more noteworthy if he wasnt doesnt mean much
nba,not_removed,the green and griffin part is argued alot but lamarcus aldridge is in the top i think
nba,not_removed,rtitlegore
nba,not_removed,lol the title is just gonna breed hate in the comments why would you title it that on rnba
nba,not_removed,that title is bad news
nba,not_removed,no way the jazz hit of
nba,not_removed,they were not
nba,not_removed,why would you title it at all even on the rockets sub they lost you didnt win
nba,not_removed,kinda expecting it haha
nba,not_removed,i just ended up deleting it because another user already shared the stat
nba,not_removed,just going by what the tweet said sure felt like it though
nba,not_removed,going by what feigen tweeted out
nba,not_removed,why tho
nba,not_removed,ah just looked it up they were dude was trippin still lights out though especially for utah
nba,not_removed,cuz im edgy
nba,not_removed,yup really hoping the perimeter d tightens up by thursday or else this game will actually look good compared to the warriors
nba,not_removed,the splash franchise
nba,not_removed,steve nash times god damn hed be such a beast in this new pace and space ball era
nba,not_removed,we shouldve traded him for that scrub klay
nba,not_removed,man its really fucking crazy how good steph was last year like its almost taken for granted a year despite attempting like threes thats ridiculous
nba,not_removed,joses isnt officially recognized by the league because he didnt make enough or fts cant remember which to qualify
nba,not_removed,apparently calderons isnt an official season because he didnt make enough free throws to qualify
nba,not_removed,and nash is an advisor for the warriors as well i believe
nba,not_removed,trade for dirk bring nash and bird out of retirement
nba,not_removed,surprised to learn only players have ever done that
nba,not_removed,if you are counting calderon then you have to include meyers leonard
nba,not_removed,thats actually insane
nba,not_removed,the hardest road
nba,not_removed,steph currys season
nba,not_removed,not sure currys fg is too significant he doesnt take a lot of midrange shots
nba,not_removed,almost averaged a for his career too
nba,not_removed,he gave birth to the pace and space era the pacefather
nba,not_removed,where is that one guy who made by just having attempts lol
nba,not_removed,i think he made up for it by having the highest ft for a season of all time
nba,not_removed,ft
nba,not_removed,counts in my heart
nba,not_removed,thats tragic how many did he miss it by he is a crazy good freethrow shopter remember when he had that one year where he shot in the high
nba,not_removed,he is indeed as well as kds personal manservant
nba,not_removed,you are correct fixed
nba,not_removed,he takes an assload of
nba,not_removed,in his phoenix years he averaged or something like that its for his career
nba,not_removed,meyers leonard maybe
nba,not_removed,guy went
nba,not_removed,the servant has a servant
nba,not_removed,yeah and when you take that many threes with little midrange the fg is more impressive because hes a good enough finisher at the rim to keep it that high
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,seriously nash working with him was a qualifier for coming to golden state
nba,not_removed,you know fg includes point shots right
nba,not_removed,yeah but not really because hes either wide open or taking an uncontested layup which would arguably come mostly from set plays
nba,not_removed,exactly and a shot is generally harder than a midrange jumpshot its further away so currys ridiculous three point shooting is also contributing with his finishing at the rim to his impressive fg which shows why he is a good enough shooter to join the the club and more impressively the
nba,not_removed,were talking fg tho
nba,not_removed,no its not theres an alternate that includes fg but this one is just overall fg including and
nba,not_removed,i made good cash off of of those teams nets and the bucks that nets one almost gave me a heartattack but eh
nba,not_removed,that nets and bucks made me some cash on fanduel im down
nba,not_removed,if the dude could hit wide open he would easily make a fortune
nba,not_removed,i didnt know who he was before this series now i want him on my team starting
nba,not_removed,he is so fucking quick on defense he catches up to guards moves laterally stops on a dime like a cartoon character if only he was more polished on offense
nba,not_removed,got a lot of love for roberson surely he is going to be back in the gym working on his all summer his has increased every year he has been in the league
nba,not_removed,hes a wonderful defender but that wide open that he passed on last night on crunch time says everything about him
nba,not_removed,hes a and d player without the not that special
nba,not_removed,dude was projected as pf coming in oo
nba,not_removed,he was great made great hustle plays and always love westbrooks oops to him
nba,not_removed,his effort on the offensive glass and second chance points was very impressive his defense obviously stellar as well but he just has to take that late wide open cannot pass that up
nba,not_removed,thats why okc let thabo leave they were grooming him and cheaper
nba,not_removed,what kind of money do you think he gets once he hits fa he hit some shots against spurswarriors so he could gain that skill with practice should be interesting to see what happens to him as an elite defensive sf
nba,not_removed,hes finally justifying my caping for him for the last years a flawed player for sure but what he does he does really well shoutout to billy for figuring out ways to get him involved hope he keeps working on his shot
nba,not_removed,okc fans i know hes been a good defender all year but was he elite for the entire year if so im surprised he didnt make any all defense team i know defense is pretty much based off of reputation but he shouldve made it over butler then since his defense has dropped off according to bulls fans
nba,not_removed,yup contract year for him so id put the overunder on the number of he practices between now and training camp at
nba,not_removed,this but i want to focus on spot up threes hopefully he doesnt learn how to dribble and make plays just be bruce bowen type great defenders who develop a solid offensive game tend to regress on the defensive end by not giving as much effort since theyre using some energy on offense see kawhi leonard and jimmy butler see klay thompson he just knocks down threes and just dribbles when he has open lane doesnt try to force things making plays he understands that thats iggy draymond and currys job
nba,not_removed,dude hit some against us this series we were fortunate that his regression tot he mean happened sooner than later
nba,not_removed,hes an elite defensive wing though so kinda special
nba,not_removed,d players like him are special and they stay in the league for a long time look at tony allen who sucks at shooting same with thabo in the playoffs when you can have a player with such a huge impact defensively paired with two players who arent because of their defense its a big bonus another example is how the contending teams that were trying to trade for corey brewer at the beginning of the season
nba,not_removed,hes better than prime jokic
nba,not_removed,d and d player probably a good dm
nba,not_removed,he is really young his defense is spectacular and he has improved his from his play against spurs he is an excellent cutter knows where to go and doesnt get lost very often i would say if he continues to work on his shooter to respectable levels he will be a very coveted player
nba,not_removed,he played pf in college moving to sg has to have been a massive adjustment
nba,not_removed,on less than a ft per game above any miss on low volume will be significant i dont know about his form but his has increased every year same thing with his still a flawed player but one with potential he is already great at one side of the court maybe he can fill in the gaps on offense he may not be a superstar but he can be a valuable role player on a contender
nba,not_removed,he wasnt this good during regular season no but then again the whole team played like ass during the regular season so not sure what you can take away from it
nba,not_removed,in my opinion guys like him are more playoff type of players all of that hustle and defense is turned down a bit when you play regular season games they pay him to turn it up in the playoffs not the regular season
nba,not_removed,all defense is almost entirely reputation hes been near elite in the regular season all three years hes been in the league any time i watched him except this season where he was just a pretty good defender
nba,not_removed,he plays all defense team caliber defense he just doesnt have the notoriety
nba,not_removed,if i were him thats all i would be doing the entire offseason if you can hit near corner and play the defense he plays you can be a max player
nba,not_removed,kawhi leonard regressed defensively lol when
nba,not_removed,if robertson was a true and d player i think the thunder would have won
nba,not_removed,its interesting how people think of brewer as a and d player when he is neither good at shooting nor defense at all
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,explains his knack for offensive rebounding
nba,not_removed,i was strictly talking about his defense but then again its hard to see him being this good over an game season
nba,not_removed,and cutting dude turned into an amazing cutter these playoffs the finishes wind up making them look easy but his timing is uncanny hes almost tyson chandleresque at times as weird as saying that about a guard is he also rebounds well
nba,not_removed,uhh did you watch the spursthunder series
nba,not_removed,absolutely if he was a true and d player the thunder would probably be a or seed and they would probably win the championship too
nba,not_removed,he played power forward in college
nba,not_removed,did you
nba,not_removed,i mean the thunder series was really close you could tell after robertson was passing up open threes that really hurt the thunder basketball is a game of inches yes on paper it doesnt really mean much but if robinson was a and d player the thunder would absolutely be a better team
nba,not_removed,yeah i watched kd drop on him like it was nothing
nba,not_removed,yeah i know i wasnt being sarcastic haha
nba,not_removed,you do realize who durant is right he drops on everyone like its nothing great offense beats great defense
nba,not_removed,oh really i thought you were because i dont think robertson being a and d player would give them a better record than the spurs
nba,not_removed,not to mention that green guarded durant for a majority of the series
nba,not_removed,i feel like if he could hit and play the way they played in the playoffs they would be the best team youre right though they werent this good in the reg season
nba,not_removed,but still orange juice is the best

nba,not_removed,idk mario chalmers isnt on the team now
nba,not_removed,oh man not sure how old you are but the first year we had dwyane wade was amazing that team featured a crackless lamar odom caron butler brian grant wade eddie jones and skip to my lou such a fun team also any team with zo and hardaway were so much fun this team is great though
nba,not_removed,the jr smith steve novak one was pretty unexpected too
nba,not_removed,dengeons and dragon for deng and dragic was the best imo
nba,not_removed,it would be if reggie bush didnt give it to now patriots reciever chris hogan like years ago when the dolphins were on hard knocks
nba,not_removed,each individual player should get to choose his own sponsor johnson and johnson would obviously have johnson and johnson dragic and waiters would have whiteside would have fiji water and babbitt could have hellmans mayonnaise
nba,not_removed,nothing new i loved it when he said he and kyrie were the best backcourt in the nba i think that was right before he was traded
nba,not_removed,whelp now it does damn you
nba,not_removed,not that theres anything wrong with that
nba,not_removed,its miami anything goes

nba,not_removed,the servant
nba,not_removed,pippin
nba,not_removed,🍊🍊🍊
nba,not_removed,lmao did he make the finals though
nba,not_removed,lol people complaining about spoilers in a damn game sorry to rob you of the enthralling experience the storyline isnt set in stone anyway he can stay or go depending on different shit
nba,not_removed,wow spoiler alert
nba,not_removed,spoilers damn man
nba,not_removed,well he isnt on any team right now so theres a chance
nba,not_removed,or i meanthe big three era cant have been that badfour straight finals
nba,not_removed,didnt even know that existed
nba,not_removed,i miss that one
nba,not_removed,demarcus cousins and omri casspi has to be up there right
nba,not_removed,i never knew that was a thing
nba,not_removed,babbit mcroberts can have waste management on their jersey
nba,not_removed,yeahhes legit kinda crazy but i do hope he does well despite that but him having good games is just encouraging him rooting for him might be enabling conundrum
nba,not_removed,yeah everyone knows those numbers are heteroonly
nba,not_removed,fooshoo
nba,not_removed,good stuff i also saw something on rnfl about how hogan is the definition of a freak athlete his athletic trainer said he was by far the best athlete that hes ever worked with and apparently hogan is a super quick study when he was on the dolphins apparently a group of his teammates used to go golfing every weekend hogan had never golfed a round in his life and after a few weeks he was outplaying the other guys paraphrased from this article
nba,not_removed,i think its something else entirely tom brady makes receivers careers dude just pulls them out of his ass especially white dudes
nba,not_removed,do you remember what game that was
nba,not_removed,what the fuck
nba,not_removed,omg
nba,not_removed,that sounds hot when was this
nba,not_removed,bruh this aint lord of the rings
nba,not_removed,theyre taking the hobbits to isengard
nba,not_removed,yo pres you ever think about life after basketball
nba,not_removed,i got to the finals and lost to the warriors queue next season and hes on the fucking warriors fml
nba,not_removed,lol thank u bruh 😂😂
nba,not_removed,i left him
nba,not_removed,he doesnt always leave its a case by case basis dawg
nba,not_removed,yea i completely understand where you are coming from but you have to remember that the heat were universally hated during those years being on reddit was an absolute nightmare if you had a heat flare and the constant hate made it not as fun for me dont get me wrong the championships were amazing but i think its personally more fun to watch a team thats not supposed to do anything punch above their weight
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,prolly cause it never was
nba,not_removed,first time i saw it was right before the playoffs started last year didnt have time to become a big thing but the dragic and deng revival post break last year was what saved our season plus they became good friends as the season went on so naturally they came up with a name for it
nba,not_removed,for sure just look at his face definitely a metta world peace kinda vibe sometimes
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,exactly
nba,not_removed,well they are prime numberstheres gotta be something there
nba,not_removed,that system just creates great white receivers i think i could have like an yard season with brady and ive never played football in my life
nba,not_removed,lacrosse with an e
nba,not_removed,baltimore
nba,not_removed,pats love our sloppy seconds then our sloppy seconds turn into prom queens with them and were stuck like damn i smashed that chick before him when she was uglier
nba,not_removed,becky
nba,not_removed,omg what thats the point of the nickname
nba,not_removed,a few days ago
nba,not_removed,you ever play nba mycareer with the captions on because its incorrectly spelled like that also when the asst coach says that phrase
nba,not_removed,waiters carrying the heat like sam carried frodo son
nba,not_removed,i dont know denver why dont you bring a gun to practice though
nba,not_removed,the hardest road
nba,not_removed,what the shit what position is your guy mine is a and no way would justice leave this backcourt dominance thing weve got going on did you not back him when the trade rumours were swirling in season one i heard that if you dont support him as much as you can then he can leave
nba,not_removed,thats too funny
nba,not_removed,durant before durant
nba,not_removed,fuck that i would love for my team to be hated and winning chips i dont come on rnba to make friends lol
nba,not_removed,dont worry buddy knicks fans will always hate you fuck the heat
nba,not_removed,i noticed that but i couldnt figure out a way to turn it into a joke so i copped out
nba,not_removed,then what are you waiting for get that money
nba,not_removed,unfortunately my dating life is a lot more like the knicks like you really shoulda seen these girls five years ago
nba,not_removed,lemme smash
nba,not_removed,what a disgusting name u should br ashamed
nba,not_removed,ssssshare the lllllload
nba,not_removed,did this actually happen i never finished the story cause it was so fucking bad
nba,not_removed,pres justice the fuck you go to golden state for justice they had the freshest squeeze
nba,not_removed,it depends on whether you involve him in the game or not
nba,not_removed,i think i played through that part while there was a bug in the game that caused the game to not load up all the cutscenes so i skipped them and it counted as me not backing him
nba,not_removed,but isnt that why we come into reddit in the first place
nba,not_removed,you wont understand until you experience it yourself
nba,not_removed,and i will always hate knicks fans i hate you too
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,denver is crazy like that he always seems like he is scene away from doing it in mycareer kinda reminds of me og loc from gta san andreas
nba,not_removed,if the game had a gun in it would be rated t probably no there was not a gun i think he was referring to the arenas thing
nba,not_removed,wow really i think this might be my favorite mycareer yet or at least since
nba,not_removed,makes sense thats why i asked what position he is with my its an unusual quarter if we dont activate the orange juice thing unless were getting crapped on we assist each other a lot
nba,not_removed,maybe for you
nba,not_removed,ok so ill take the minute negative to go with the overwhelmingly huge positives ill take it on the chin
nba,not_removed,nsfl
nba,not_removed,what the fuck
nba,not_removed,wait why tf is this downvoted clearly i dont get reddit
nba,not_removed,goodness gracious
nba,not_removed,lmao thats the best comparison ive ever seen
nba,not_removed,you mean that boy jeffrey i thought he was going to college
nba,not_removed,og loc is a great comparison maybe a much calmer version of him
nba,not_removed,damn i was expecting some serious locker room controversy with denver and was hoping this was true lol
nba,not_removed,well it wasnt the worst thats for sure spike lee last year made that very hard to beat maybe i am too hard on it but the cut scenes seemed cheesy and the player just seemed dumb as hell its probably better than im giving it credit
nba,not_removed,cause no one wants to see a thumb as a dick and personally as a guy who owns one this is a nightmare
nba,not_removed,cut me off the team one more time
nba,not_removed,i dont think a lot of people like these cut scenes in mycareer and a lot of other sports games developers are slowly progressing into a linear storyline thing which really isnt suited for any sports game its why nba is still the greatest basketball game thats ever played the soundtracks the showcase before the draft the polished mycareer without any storylines etc edit also gotta add the mj mode where you replay mjs greatest games and pretty much control mj in the process the association mode which i actually enjoyed so much due to it being a mode you can literally do anything on and it being pretty much the starting point for the franchise to take over the basketball game popularity from ea due to their failed game nba elite
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,fuuuuck the soundtrack for was god tier i actually found a playlist of it on spotify the other day brought back some good memories
nba,not_removed,alright i chuckled
nba,not_removed,i think it will be kawhi and here is why the mvp always goes to a high seeded team so that rules out westbrook cousins and davis lebron usually coasts the regular season so it wont be him curry and durant will both be stars on the same team so they will be putting up less numbers so that rules them out if kawhi keeps improving at the rate that he is the mvp trophy will be handed to him easily
nba,not_removed,i hate what im about to say without making my own list but i do not like that list at all carmelo drummond and lowry are ridiculously high
nba,not_removed,you said george is in the western conference you know i think curry should have the best shot but he probably wont get it because of voter fatigue if durant averages more ppg than curry i think he gets it kawhi probably comes after that and then lebron nobody else has a real chance at mvp in my opinion
nba,not_removed,this list seems all sorts of wrong to me honestly lebron can be reasonably enough but melo has literally a chance of being mvp as does drummond because neither will be a top seed most likely maaaaaaaybe detroit but itll be a weak seed and honestly neither are nearly good enough either kawhi should be if lebron is as the spurs will likely be the seed and hes the only other guy on a likely top team that is the clearly the best player on his team plus hes loved by the media lillard should also make the list somewhere were expected to be or in the west but he got mvp votes last season and if things go just a little bit right the blazers could be a seed and again hes the undisputed best player on team lowry had the best season of his career hes not getting any younger and it wasnt even close to an mvp season with the talent in the league right now unless they win its unlikely just gotta have bigger volume stats than that but i guess he has a chance as hell be on a seed westbrook has pretty much no chance of being a top seed so hes probably out too also the reigning mvp should be higher
nba,not_removed,kawhi and lebron should be considered favorites should be considered in that second tier of candidates should be considered dark horses if their teams do well they will definitely have the hype and stat line to win the mvp however their teams will likely not do well enough thus the dark horse status
nba,not_removed,good list but i would basically swap melo and kawhis spots
nba,not_removed,blake
nba,not_removed,great article mostly agrees with my opinions ive got kawhi much higher and melo much lower though
nba,not_removed,ee
nba,not_removed,my top mvp watch list top tier kawhi hes going to be on a top seed and he im predicting hell perform greatly defensively and offensively i believe hes going to be the mvp lebron believe hes going to coast westbrook hes going to be contending for the mvp award against bron and kawhi for sure but on a lower seeded team i dont know runner tier harden hes going to lead the rockets in the po with that atrocious defense his team not him paul george same case with westbrook pacers are going to be seed most likely and so hes shut off of the mvp award like always hes going to be contending doing his thing bg same as last tier steph hes still going to contend for mvp hes unanimous for a reason but who knows what tier hes going to be but his ppg and other stats will drop of the addition on kd durant his ppg and rpg curry is really good at rebounding for his height will significantly drop with steph on the team lowry he will lead his team to the seed of the eastern conference and challenge lebron with a sorta same team as last year but since hes getting older he wont score as often
nba,not_removed,my moneys on okc to barely get seed on brodie getting and snatch the mvp away from curry
nba,not_removed,top tier candidates lebron westbrook harden curry durant mid tier candidates leonard george paul lower tier candidates drummond lillard anthony davis cousins lowry irving griffin lebron is going to average his usual those are mvp numbers and if the cavaliers are able to win games i consider him a lock to win the award westbrook is going to have a monster year i honestly believe is within reach the only question is whether the thunder will win enough games for him to win it same applies to harden his statlile will be crazy will the rockets win enough games curry and durant are going to split votes like paul and griffin split votes back in the spurs will be good leonard needs to improve his numbers though george is in a situation between westbrookharden and leonard he needs to improve his numbers and he needs his team to win enough games for him to have a real chance everybody else has a pretty slim chance
nba,not_removed,tier bron he is after legacy now and wants to remind everyone that hes the champ oh and voter fatigue is over he is back to being the peoples champ westbrook just enough wins and eye popping stats durant lots of wins always finds a way to scorelots tier kawhi enough wins but his stats dont stand out from the pack wants a ring bad and pretty good clippers are a sneaky contender for best team lillard making playoffs alpha dog of his team big scorer pissed off cos people always forget about him curry his bad playoffs hurts his image a bit so does his stacked team but he will make it rain in a historic manner tier ant davis you forgot how good he was his stats are dominant but his team doesnt win enough really good scores heaps indiana isnt that good he is good new york will be a disaster harden read above giannis game changing stats will create hype but the bucks wont win enough my tip lebron dark horse super dark horse lillard
nba,not_removed,i think the spurs are going to fall off quite a bit this season likely still win games because of course they will but i truthfully do not think pau gasol makes you much better as a team and they sacrificed some depth to get him fall off but still win games um wat and gasol couldve gone anywhere he wanted but doesnt make the spurs a better team im waiting for someone to be like its just a prank bro
nba,not_removed,carmelo lul
nba,not_removed,lowry lmao
nba,not_removed,i think that the spurs would need to win games again because the mvp usually goes to someone who puts up big stats kawhi is an incredible player but arent exactly insane stats i mean his defense in addition to those stats make him an mvpcaliber player but it seems like voters like stats and wins over intangible things like defensive impact for every zach lowe you have ten of these dumb random local guys who dont even watch other teams lebron coasts but hell still put up
nba,not_removed,yeah if i am wrong and the spurs still win like some games kawhi will have a great chance
nba,not_removed,i like you
nba,not_removed,unfortunately this article just seemed to be written by someone who doesnt really understand how the mvp is selected plus no real statistics to back up his claims just a bunch of i feel like choices kawhi below guys like lowry drummond and melo is kind of ridiculous
nba,not_removed,melo is mostly based on brand and nyc if the knicks are good which there is a chance he will get traction if lebron coasts hardcore which is also possible since hes got his ring for cleveland now then there is a very real chance that i see like i said about kawhi i think the spurs will come back to earth a bit in the season and kawhi is not a huge brand or anything the reason i didnt feel good about putting him so low is because i know he is better than most of the guys in front of him but zach lowe has ranted the last years about how pau gasol doesnt play any defense anymore and he actually makes your rebounding worse i like lillard in my original cut i had him there but the middle of the west will be much beefier hopefully since it was kind of killed by injuries last year and the blazers wont just be a nice story anymore i think the blazers will win around games again but they wont have as much narrative even if they are a better team winning which they would have to be improved to get back to like i said lowry was largely wishful thinking on my part he is way underappreciated to me but i actually think the raptors are legit the only real challengers to the cavs in the east this season and if they could hop the cavs and be the seed because lebron coasts hardcore which is not unreasonable and lowry has another awesome year i could absolutely see him getting a little traction the thunder will have crazy narrative and public opinion on their side and westbrook will have insane numbers if there is a guy who could win mvp without a top seed it would be westbrook this season not many people have won in a row and no one will want to vote for him this season even if durant hadnt come he was likely to take a step back not a big one just everyone has that season where they peak and last year was probably it for steph throw in durant and his numbers probably fall back lebron didnt win it his first year in miami because people didnt want to give it to him they wont want to give it to steph or durant this season either thanks for the good reply part of the thinking outside the box was so that people didnt just see a genericass list and go i mean that looks ok i guess so thanks for the input
nba,not_removed,so the thunder have a close to zero chance to get the seed but the blazers have a good chance if everything goes right no offense but i am calling bullshit on that i am not convinced that portland is so much more talented than the thunder granted okc has a whole at sf but they will start roberson and is he really much worse than the clippers starting luc no hes not besides that okc has good depth throughout their roster and a coach coming off a promising rookie season i am excited to see what they do
nba,not_removed,this is the best analysis the only thing is id say curry probably ais going to be on the same tier as lebron and kawhi because warriors are gonna be the best team and hell be the best player
nba,not_removed,i enjoy seeing the love for kawhi but honestly his persona and temperament work against him if he celebrated schooling opponents like he often does and was a more vocal guy to the media his popularity would be at least im not saying i want him to be like that at all i like how he acts and performs as is a true professional who knows how to act like a winner
nba,not_removed,no way is wb considered top tier stephdurant in tier youre overrating too also overrating bg
nba,not_removed,the whole gasolregression thing is so silly to me our starting lineup features danny green who is a top defender at his position kawhi who is the premier perimeter defender and lamarcus aldridge who has improved his defensive awareness and only stands to get better one on one gasol is a stout defender sure hes weak on the pick and roll but tbh duncan wasnt exceptional in his old age against the pnr either other than that gasol drastically improves our offense there was very little input coming from the spot last season parker will have a somewhat resurgent year with all the space gasol and aldridge will create which also leads to danny green having a resurgent year spurs are going to be a problem like they are every single season if not more so this season
nba,not_removed,lmao hes gonna drop on your sorry asses again
nba,not_removed,keep hating
nba,not_removed,yeah i mean the raptors won games and lowry put up career statsand he got four votes one fourthplace and three fifthplace
nba,not_removed,because they are villains and they will likely not jell as well as people seem to think right away at least and most of all their numbers will both take a hit but for me it is actually the villain status more than anything else lebron didnt win his first year in miami largely because people just didnt want to give it to him unfortunately narrative matters a lot with awards but i do agree that people seem to not be giving enough chance to durantcurry
nba,not_removed,idk i think he has a good chance if he improves even just a little to like you can say voters like huge numbers but he got more than double the first team all nba votes than durant this year without big numbers
nba,not_removed,who said kawhi is not gonna improve
nba,not_removed,are not eye popping stats but lets not forget that leonard did that in less minutes than a typical star and is also one of the most efficient players in the game that plus his dpoy defense is why he finished second last year and obviously team record its not gonna be just raw box score stats that sway voters especially since people are starting to look more into analytics
nba,not_removed,most important thing is narrative tho and media loves spurs circle jerk as much as anyone the only thing is i doubt spurs will be as good as they were last year i think its gonna be a man race between lebron and kawhi realistically with kd and curry and imo
nba,not_removed,i agree with you just based on the stats portion defense alone isnt going to get you an mvp even if they win games hed still have to average near and all while keeping the defensive numbers hes had the past two years
nba,not_removed,yet the guy was second in voting last season
nba,not_removed,just spitting some straight facts
nba,not_removed,i mean the main problem i have with kawhi is that i think the spurs will take a step back because of gasol the stats say he is a piss poor defender and he actually makes your team worse at rebounding when he is on the floor zach lowe has been ranting about this the last years when people voted pau for all star he can still ball but they gave way too much for him and i think they might only lol win like games this season kawhi isnt a huge brand like many of the others and a huge part of his value is defense which as i said in the article people undervalue a ton i said that kawhi is way better than many ahead of him and that is the reason i didnt feel good about putting him so low
nba,not_removed,i dont think the blazers will be a top seed but i think its fair to put a little more faith in a team that was the seed last year played at a win pace after starting with a brand new roster and improved in the off season than in a team that just lost its best two shooters one of whom is the best player in the world okc has some talent but its a very poorly constructed team as is imo theres literally no shooting from anyone worth playing at the through your only good point shooter who is good enough to warrant time is illysaova thats bad news its a talented team with players who just dont fit together plus depth what good player is on the bench not named illysaova or kanter depending on who starts the guard depth is awful unless you plan on starting singler at sf and roberson at the backup and the blazers are a team with depth i dont see that kind of depth on okcs roster i dont mean it in a bad way theres enough talent to make a low playoff seed even without cohesion but i think this is a case where the product is less than the sum of the parts
nba,not_removed,if kd decides curry is the main guy or vice versa stephdurant are top tier and bg are in the right place imo
nba,not_removed,we basically swapped gasol for duncan which is currently an upgrade lee for west another upgrade and added a couple young pieces that are solid im trying to grasp the logic behind how we wont be just as solid as we ever were that seems to be floating about kawhi is only getting better to top it all off ffs
nba,not_removed,for some reason many people are predicting a major spurs regression based on the idea that pau is a terrible defender despite all reputable defensive stats saying otherwise
nba,not_removed,sure
nba,not_removed,lowry is never gonna win mvp man
nba,not_removed,still weaker than bron coasting leonard needs to have more offense i think
nba,not_removed,improve to
nba,not_removed,yeah because his team won games thats what i said voters look at stats and wins im talking about how the mvp is voted on by the people who have votes not what i personally believe should constitute an mvp
nba,not_removed,kawhi is near the tipping point with his brand hes not a household name but an mvp caliber season would certainly push him over the edge derrick rose has a similar reserved personality to kawhi and he won at a young age without being a household name or having a strong brand relatively speaking before the season
nba,not_removed,what stats say pau is a piss poor defender the same stats that say duncan is a great defender also say pau is a very good defensive player dws drtg onoff numbers dbpm and rpm all have as a plus defender and he got those while playing with much worse defenders than hell play with in san antonio
nba,not_removed,seriously we havent yet seen prime kawhi and he was mvp runnerup last season lamarcus is a superstar and is still with a season under his belt hell be devestating on both ends and its funny when golden state were reported to be close to signing lee it was the league is fucked but when he signs with the spurs eh hes trash now lee is seriously better than west hes a better rebounder a better passer and hes smarter also someone else who goes overlooked jonathan simmons as far as prospects go hes older but he gets better every game hes explosive and can get to the cup whenever he wants if he adds a consistent point shot hed be a dangerous asset
nba,not_removed,i know at least he can be in the top right right right
nba,not_removed,true but leonard beat him out for last year if the spurs and cavs are in the he probably gets it
nba,not_removed,no but something like with wins could get it done remember he was in mvp voting and he averaged and lebron averaged stats arent everything
nba,not_removed,agree there if i am wrong and the spurs end up winning like some games again and kawhi steps up even more then i absolutely would think he wins mvp and becomes damn near a household name type
nba,not_removed,leonard beat lebron by total points last year with a advantage unless his stats significantly improve or lebrons significantly decrease and the spurs have a similar win advantage i dont think hell get it
nba,not_removed,i dont see the spurs maintaining and the cavs not improving i have to think irving will play better
nba,not_removed,yea but lebrons team was trash spurs won games
nba,not_removed,with all that said i agree with you and think the spurs will take a step back with their record my guess is wins but its the spurs and they always manage to prove me wrong im going with the field on who wins the mvp hopefully westbrook but i wouldnt be upset if kawhi won hes a likable guy
nba,not_removed,than kawhi lol ok
nba,not_removed,wins isnt trash
nba,not_removed,no i mean better than his previous year your claim is that the cavs will maintain their record i say it will be better as irving will be back and better than ever
nba,not_removed,well they certainly werent playing like a championship team
nba,not_removed,oh okay that makes sense well in the end im a blind homer and we wont know anything till next season either way i think he has a great shot at it
nba,not_removed,oh okay that makes sense well in the end im a blind homer and we wont know anything till next season either way i think he has a great shot at it
nba,not_removed,oh okay that makes sense well in the end im a blind homer and we wont know anything till next season either way i think he has a great shot at it
nba,not_removed,impressive raw numbers for sure but the shooting splits are hard to ignore
nba,not_removed,missed like shots a game iirc
nba,not_removed,id love to see anyone else up up those numbers regardless of efficiency its incredibly impressive and there is no one else in the league who i think can do that
nba,not_removed,you have to remember he took a lot of shots in all of those games game game game i only have the last games from a recent comment but you can check other i dunno
nba,not_removed,yeah thats pretty good
nba,not_removed,cant believe people harp on his efficiency in that series the man had to play that way to even keep cleveland in the game they had no other offensive weapons and him being aggressive and shooting a ton of shots kept pressure on gs and allowed the cavs to get offensive rebounds for easy baskets that was one of the best finals performances ive ever witnessed the man had to do literally everything score create the entire offense rebound defend and be a leader was amazing totally put the team on his back and the fact he was able to win two games is a testament to his greatness
nba,not_removed,people forget dudes rested as fuck he knows that hes at the final lap of the season and once hes done with this shit hell have all of the time in the fucking world to rest and fuck some hot as fuck brazillian chick in the back of a kia for the olympics after he torches some random ass country by points
nba,not_removed,was a shame he didnt get mvp
nba,not_removed,low efficiency
nba,not_removed,actually very easy to accept in the context of having a completely busted team
nba,not_removed,not hard to ignore when your best teammate is tristan thompson
nba,not_removed,the fact that he still made percent of his shots after taking like shots a game is impressive to me especially with all the mileage on his legs from playing an entire season of basketball he averaged
nba,not_removed,i agree that it was pretty terrible efficiency but with everyone else on the cavs bricking their jumpshots except mozgov the warriorsiggy could really focus all the defensive containment on lebron without having to worry about anyone else
nba,not_removed,scoring efficiency aside he still grabbed a ridiculous amount of rebounds and assists
nba,not_removed,pretty sure he only lost by one vote
nba,not_removed,its an important caveat though
nba,not_removed,he didnt really have any other choice but its important to note
nba,not_removed,i mean his splits for the entire playoffs were pretty bad against atlanta against chicago even a pedestrian against boston
nba,not_removed,his splits that postseason werent much better when love and kyrie were healthy in previous rounds
nba,not_removed,i mean yeah he still played great but that picture without showing the volume is kind of misleading
nba,not_removed,yeah those arent too good but as you know they didnt matter much he was goofing around against atl
nba,not_removed,quincy pondexter is smiling down on them from heaven
nba,not_removed,jrue holiday is the most underrated player in the league
nba,not_removed,anthony davis is the man
nba,not_removed,fun facts over the last games pels have not once played a center omer asik or alexis ajinca they are starting dante cunningham and solomon hill at the forward spots dante cunningham and solomon hill who spot up for corner in the pels smallball look have started to call themselves the corner boys they are both shooting from three since the small ball lineup change buddy is averaging ppg rebounds shooting from three this month games pels are weirdly in games dante cunningham starts
nba,not_removed,niiiiiccceeee i want to see playoff ad again it was nuts
nba,not_removed,otherwise known as the cannon fodder seed
nba,not_removed,the west is werid its playoff teams and losers that have a fringe shot at the seed
nba,not_removed,jrue is back and tyreke is just getting healthy
nba,not_removed,the brow doing brow things hope they can stay healthy and get into the playoffs
nba,not_removed,trailblazers might not get into the playoffs but the pelicans might odd
nba,not_removed,is this team becoming spooky
nba,not_removed,considering the bad start the pelicans had and the dumpster fire every other bad team in the west is i think its pretty safe to say they got this—assuming nobody gets injured again
nba,not_removed,cant take it from my kings tho
nba,not_removed,though personally i want the kings to grab that seed im honestly betting on the pelicans taking it i think theyll have a better half of the year than the kings i dont see the blazers picking up enough momentum to get in there but itll be fun to see what happens
nba,not_removed,once again the collapse of portland has made the playoff race interesting
nba,not_removed,and yet they are still games under and wow upon further review there are only teams in the nba with a winning record right now
nba,not_removed,dante cunningham is an awesome dude glad to see him and the pelicans starting to do well though theyre gonna make it harder for me than it currently is to hope my wolves can make the seed
nba,not_removed,wow theyre definitely gonna make the playoffs then i wouldve never thought anthony davis is too good at basketball
nba,not_removed,nay reke is the man wins losses with him able to play this season check pels record withwithout reke play the last few years
nba,not_removed,its still possible the twolves could make the playoffs
nba,not_removed,lets go
nba,not_removed,lol i remember like games in some pels fans saying the seasons lostand time to tank
nba,not_removed,no offense to the pelicans recovery but hooooly shit this stat hahahahaha the definition of cherrypicked
nba,not_removed,they should have just tanked
nba,not_removed,yeah its really been working out well for them these past few years
nba,not_removed,i actually googled to see if he died im not sure why
nba,not_removed,ripqpon
nba,not_removed,shit the only reason the warriors were able to even get to the finals in the first place was because he was injured does anyone really think that they could have gotten past the pellies with holiday healthy fuck the warriors and their asterisk championship s
nba,not_removed,hes the motherfucking jruth
nba,not_removed,scroll alllll the way to the bottom
nba,not_removed,hes gonna get paid next year
nba,not_removed,huge if jrue
nba,not_removed,i miss the days of iggy and holiday but i believe embiid can take us higher than being a mid tier playoff team
nba,not_removed,glad i drafted him i need assists and hes delivering
nba,not_removed,our fans consistently forget how good he is and when he goes out for a few games the talks of getting rid of him always come about
nba,not_removed,hes really good and has been for a while people just forget about him because of the injuries and the absence this season
nba,not_removed,the architect anthony davis reclaim rebuild and retire
nba,not_removed,member when jvg told that he would do ad for kat one for one trade
nba,not_removed,should have had ad at the center as soon as it was clear he bulked up
nba,not_removed,dante to me is solid hes mobile defensively doesnt mind the dirty work and occasionally hits the corner
nba,not_removed,really cool to see buddy is looking like the player we all thought he was
nba,not_removed,the corner boys is so corny lol
nba,not_removed,its that villanova winning spirit from cunningham
nba,not_removed,watched asik warm up before the game in mke and wow he looked like his knees could just buckle at any moment dude has no mobility left unfortunately
nba,not_removed,i dont know what i want more playoffs cousins or playoffs ad
nba,not_removed,nah it might also be the develop young guys and get them experience seed
nba,not_removed,not saying that theyll win but a healthy pelican squad is a pretty interesting matchup for the warriors lots of length and switchibility all around
nba,not_removed,hey man be nice
nba,not_removed,its the warriors and spurs fault too many wins at the top of the table pushing the bottom right out the place grizzlies have a better record than the place celtics
nba,not_removed,and the east has two playoff teams
nba,not_removed,its perfect almost every teams fanbase in the conference believes they have a chance
nba,not_removed,who will be the biggest loser
nba,not_removed,throw in pondexter and suddenly things get really interesting
nba,not_removed,race for in the west is gonna be tight this year
nba,not_removed,dare we say
nba,not_removed,nothing is safe around the pelicans
nba,not_removed,its not safe at all even if healthy too many teams fighting for seed and gentry sucks
nba,not_removed,its possible games back and the next games are vs blazers wizards vs jazz vs mavericks
nba,not_removed,we were like most people would have been saying the same of their team
nba,not_removed,they are games under
nba,not_removed,i also remember this entire sub bitching about getting ad help and how he was going to leave and we should just trade him right now spent a lot of time batting back that horseshit too i cant recall how many times pels fans had to remind people of our top players were injuredout because of a pregnant wifes brain tumor
nba,not_removed,how after that started people said their season was done yet they are still in the fight
nba,not_removed,well embracing the tank hasnt worked either yall have your picks yet still scrapping the bottom
nba,not_removed,well shit mayn dont leave me hangin
nba,not_removed,you were thinking of bryce dejeanjones
nba,not_removed,yeah dude pellies woulda totally won the ship that year if jrue was healthy smh
nba,not_removed,tbh the cavs should have won in and the warriors in but injuries flipped the script
nba,not_removed,muh pels
nba,not_removed,had him in fantasy this year and the past season hes always been a good fantasy player hes not underrated to anyone who plays in a competitive fantasy league thats for sure
nba,not_removed,lot of issues with the pelicans maybe but holiday is definitely not one of them
nba,not_removed,does that mean hes going to hit nerlens and okafor with a steel chair
nba,not_removed,hes coming for you hhh
nba,not_removed,ha ha
nba,not_removed,to be fair thats coming from a coach with an eye for development who knows what he personally believes he could turn kat into
nba,not_removed,tbh id be super happy with either one kat hasnt hit his peak yet but hes already killing it i guess ad hasnt hit his peak either but i dont think you can go wrong with either kat has a better shot from the games ive seen at least but ad is more dominant in the paint
nba,not_removed,pounds
nba,not_removed,he is an odd player started out his career as an undersized and now his size and abilities are perfect for a small ball four role undervalued and a veteran at this point in his career
nba,not_removed,its sick as heck
nba,not_removed,money making brothers on the corner
nba,not_removed,yeah but its unique in the league honestly its not even clever idk how no one came up with that first heat could have but its cool
nba,not_removed,he never did and he hasnt been bad this year his skill set is just outdated
nba,not_removed,playoff ad against the defensive juggernaut warriors where he was da guy fg years old
nba,not_removed,i dunno i really cant see it being interesting if the warriors actually try like maybe davis goes supernova and knocks a game off to avoid the sweep but theres just not enough talent on the pellies roster to legitimately compete thats not any heavy shade theres only like one team in the league that can compete with a healthy dubs squad also i doubt the switch everything strategy gums up the warriors offense this year as it has in the past kd just generates too many mismatches if you switch a stephkd pnr i just cant see jrue bothering kds shot in isolation and i love jrues defense
nba,not_removed,you dont have to switch everything when kd isos
nba,not_removed,revision for niceness the west is weird the gap between the and seed is pretty major
nba,not_removed,even as a lakers fan i would love for demarcus or ad to take that spot especially the kings since dmc is older and havent been there before
nba,not_removed,rockets are pretty decent apparently somehow
nba,not_removed,the place pistons would be a playoff team in the west
nba,not_removed,no the east has one team that will go to the finals likely one other team that will make the ecf and six to eight other teams that can hold their own in the conference
nba,not_removed,i think it is portland the pellies the kings or the nuggets i really think the rest of the conf is going to bottom out hard and get a normal distribution going here soon probably once teams start making moves to address some of their holes
nba,not_removed,dis motherfucker hahaha
nba,not_removed,mmmmm say it
nba,not_removed,dont say it
nba,not_removed,i injured my pointer finger commenting in our sub
nba,not_removed,really though pelicans are fucking angry ass birds
nba,not_removed,means something is going right if i had to pick a team for the seed with how things are right now id choose them thats all im saying blazers would be interesting if they can address their problem at center though
nba,not_removed,the only teams with a chance are the kings and theyre the kings
nba,not_removed,was last year was this year
nba,not_removed,its the wins part pelicans very well might be competing for seed again and turning it back around but you cant tell me are tied in the win column with the seed isnt cherry picked
nba,not_removed,id much rather roll long term with simmonsembiid and two top picks coming than jrue holidays expiring and tyreke evans surrounding ad
nba,not_removed,alive
nba,not_removed,yikes
nba,not_removed,heat wouldve won in if shaq was healthy celtics wouldve won in if kg was healthy celtics lost in the final minutes of game in and perkins was out he wouldve tipped that one in their favor too bulls wouldve won in if rose was healthy okc wouldve won in if ibaka played in the first two spurs games edit bulls is a huge stretch they got pounded by miami the year before also okc might be a better example than okc they were scorching earth before beverley took out westbrooks knee
nba,not_removed,kyrie irving and kevin love are much more important than andrew bogut
nba,not_removed,cavs were missing their second and third option and the warriors were what exactly were their debilitating injuries
nba,not_removed,funny how when it came to curryiggy this past year the narrative has been he was healthy enough to play no excuses they lost fair and square but mike conley missing one game in the series devalues the series win because he was injured same with bogut everyone is here like hes their best player at best him being out doesnt make a difference they lost fair and square but beverleyholiday both guys who are at best their teams best players being injured somehow puts an asterisk on the warriors championship ill give you the finals but thats one series theres a reason we play games and series to determine a champion luck plays its role but lets not sit here and act like they didnt put themselves in a position to get lucky and take advantage of it as a nets fan who survived losing to the bulls c team in i can assure you that getting lucky with health is only half of it you need to take advantage
nba,not_removed,you sold out you sold out
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,not really fair considering ad is only and still has tons of room for development hes only years older than kat
nba,not_removed,ads point shooting has improved every single season so that definitely wouldnt be a deciding factor for me what is a deciding factor for me though is defense kat has a great defensive mind coaching him but has been a garbage fire on that side ad is leaping and bounds ahead of kat defensively now its possible that kat could develop that but its a big if
nba,not_removed,lol are you serious kat is not on ads level
nba,not_removed,hes over he is pulling a kevin garnett its been made apparent he doesnt want to be considered or play as a traditional center
nba,not_removed,theyre more worried about fatigue he can play against traditional centers for the most part but when he does it for extended periods of time he seems to get really worn down as the game goes on
nba,not_removed,gotta give credit to adelman for getting him to shoot the midrange centers and forwards always seemed to start shooting the midrange when they started playing for adelman
nba,not_removed,hes a winner
nba,not_removed,the definition of generational talent
nba,not_removed,i extrapolate him to be the greatest playoff player of all time adjusting for efficiency vs quality of opponent
nba,not_removed,weve never seen playoffs cousins though
nba,not_removed,we were winning two of them near the end of the fourth quarter in our last series against them before blowing the lead because all of our guys were tired after playing with a short lineup sure they didnt have durant but we didnt have jrue healthy tyreke healthy and multiple other players were hobbled during that series there were two games in the first series where we should have won wed have no chance of winning a series but wed absolutely have a chance of taking a game
nba,not_removed,fair points all around the pelicans would have to bog down the pace somehow and get draykd into isos on ad get them in foul trouble and they can steal a game or two
nba,not_removed,well theres also the fact that gentry knows steph klay and draymond better than most coaches considering he was an assistant coach for gsw before no if you dont think that having inside knowledge could help just ask the new orleans team who overcame no david west to take games against the lakers no had trevor ariza and dj mbenga both of whom knew the lakers schemes and played well in that series
nba,not_removed,id be satisfied with getting in as the seed and winning game against gs i think if jrue didnt miss so many games to start the year the pels would be about though thats not saying much
nba,not_removed,wins wise right now yes but the talent gap is not huge between the jazz and the kingsnugsblazerspels it will even out
nba,not_removed,nah im hoping for portland or us to take it if dmc doesnt make the playoffs maybe hell leave and then we can steal him
nba,not_removed,fuck those two we need to get healthy and fun for that spot ourselves
nba,not_removed,all but teams would be fighting for an seed if they were in the west
nba,not_removed,oh i think so too but fanbases will always believe until the math goes to chance the mavs are only like games out
nba,not_removed,improvement
nba,not_removed,not particularly
nba,not_removed,i mean its kinda a big deal for a team that started so poorly
nba,not_removed,theyre a game and a half out from the seed having the same amount of wins as the seed isnt cherry picked
nba,not_removed,and what if steve nash didnt get hipchecked into the scorers table
nba,not_removed,nah the heat wouldve beaten the bulls again in
nba,not_removed,bulls wouldve won in if rose was healthy funniest thing ive seen on this sub in a while
nba,not_removed,i disagree about the bulls in and okc in no one was beating the heat in either of those years besides the spurs
nba,not_removed,we also coulda won in if beverly didnt slam russ in the knee
nba,not_removed,the nets would have won in and had the lakers and spurs didnt not spontaneously combust in the finals
nba,not_removed,lakers wouldve won in if bynum was healthy and
nba,not_removed,wolves wouldve won in if cassell was healthy
nba,not_removed,rockets would have won in if yao was healthy they matched up very well with the celtics
nba,not_removed,they lost iggy objectively some of their best defensive players come on now no one is saying those players are equal but they were huge injuries that changed the series just because they arent equal doesnt mean they arent as crippling edit man cleveland fans are so defensive iggy could barely move and bogut was one of the best rim protectors just watch the first games compared to the last cavs didnt just find a magical formula to beat the warriors after getting handled their defense got way worse
nba,not_removed,probably but the series was proportionally way closer than the series
nba,not_removed,what does lebron fear in the playoffs a defensive center bogut isnt as good as kyrie or love but his skill set was more important in defeating lebron
nba,not_removed,i mean fuck the warriors but lets not act like losing bogut didnt impact them
nba,not_removed,they lost by points in the last game add bogut and make iguodala healthy
nba,not_removed,i agree with you but holiday is easily new orleans second best player tyreke isnt even close to as impactful as jrue
nba,not_removed,i didnt sell out i browed in
nba,not_removed,i dont think theyre equal ad is top imo but id be happy with either one kat is going to be a top player with upside for better in that scenario youre betting on the future i think he has the tools to be on the level of ad whether or not he works hard enough to get there remains to be seen but i think thats a justification and he has a better ball so if you value a big with his skill set over ads then i think you go with kat as long as youre willing to take the risk he might not turn out as good as ad
nba,not_removed,not right now for sure but there is no indication that kats career ceiling is lower than ad
nba,not_removed,of course he isnt because kat is in his year and ad is in his
nba,not_removed,i think they measure him tho like yrs old at the draft combine he was and at age he was measured again at with his length tho hes effectively well over ft
nba,not_removed,really i vaguely remember him saying explicitly that he was willing to play center but this was a few years ago so i could be misremembering or he might have changed his mind i kinda thought it was a coaching decision to help reduce wear and tear and free him up to roam a bit more on both ends
nba,not_removed,seriously i felt like he was close to the height of embiid when we played the pels
nba,not_removed,hes shot the midrange since college
nba,not_removed,ast
nba,not_removed,you seriously underestimate kevin fucking durant and the year to hear improvement of the warriors roster in the past two years two years ago draymond was a good pf klay thompson was an amazing shooting guard and curry shouldnt have been mvp now dray is a top pf in the league klay thompson is a top sg and curry was a unanimous mvp yes i understand davis has improved leaps and bounds and jrue holiday and tyreke will do stuff but dont compare the two playoff series as if they mean so much it would be a fully different matchup this year
nba,not_removed,yes it is the jazz have a team kingspels have star blazers have none of them have anything behind those stars the nugs are to young and underdeveloped
nba,not_removed,i might want markelle fultz more than a playoff spot
nba,not_removed,false
nba,not_removed,im not saying its not a big deal im saying i sort of laughed at it at the same time while still finding it cool
nba,not_removed,fuck well there goes my new years eve happiness
nba,not_removed,and what if steve nash didnt get hipchecked into the scorers table good times
nba,not_removed,not like lebron metaphorically ripped roses beating heart out of his chest and ate it the year before
nba,not_removed,yeah the asspounding the previous year eliminates that possibility mvp shooting in a series is a disgrace
nba,not_removed,oh yeah i dont know why i forgot that one okc was probably even better than okc also i dont know why i said chicago wouldve won we all know thats not true
nba,not_removed,the chicago stags wouldve won if bob duffy wasnt injured
nba,not_removed,its silly to even talk about lmao warriors didnt choose for kyrie and love to get hurt and bogut has an i njury history and iggy is a little bit old thats just how sports go but it isnt a surprise lebron went off when bogut got hurt boguts prescence was so valuable defensively it was obvious when lebron would look bogut dead in the eye and decide not to drive
nba,not_removed,straight up im not arguing because every championship involves a decent amount of luck its just too hard to win on pure talent in a stacked league but losing bogut wasnt that big of a deal he played for like mins a game and had one sick quarter with like blocks larger factors at play steph being offinjured kyrielebron peaking for a game at the same time and the most important according to nate duncan who is my personal god playing anderson fucking varejao and festus ezeli real minutes granted bogut was better than those guys but the reason lebron shit on those guys is the same problem bogut would have had the cavs entire offense against gsw is running wing guard or wing big p rs to get lebron or kyrie mis matched with a big or steph on an island with at least shooters spread out the ezeli switches onto lebron killed them first the he hit near end of game then the fake that got him free throws bogut arguably even worse than ezeli on those switches and his main skill which is hanging back on p r and blocking shots is exactly what the cavs took away from ezeli by drawing him out i think if kerr played draymond at center all game they win the finals kerr remains even this season committed to playing backup traditional bigs real minutes could be our ticket to a good shot at taking out the most talented team in history i think theyre favorites but the cavs have reached a level of success against this team no other team in the league has showed capable of attaining
nba,not_removed,they lost iggy what he may not have been but he played at least minutes every game if his injury was as bad as rnba makes it out to be he would have been on the bench all night irving was in a hospital bed and love was in a suit bogut played like minutes per game and was often exploited when he was in and iggy was healthy enough to still play and contribute decent minutes just because they arent equal doesnt mean they arent as crippling what do you even mean by that are you really going to argue that losing love and irving for an entire series and having to play mike miller and james jones legitimate finals minutes isnt more crippling than bogut missing games and iggy not being but still playing thats just laughable i get that its popular on here to be noncontroversial and act like two situations are equal even when they arent but these circumstances arent even close enough to do that
nba,not_removed,steph being injured and clearly off because of it was the largest factor
nba,not_removed,they lost iggy they didnt lose iggy iggy just broke down with age which is what happens if you ride a year old as your only lebron stopper for two straight finals appearances iggys showing his age even more this season last finals wasnt a fluke its just that he couldnt keep up anymore
nba,not_removed,well i forgot about him thats why i asked
nba,not_removed,add kevin love
nba,not_removed,fuckin gold
nba,not_removed,ad was better than kat now in his year as well
nba,not_removed,im just saying he definitely in that height area of kd and dirk and those guys people harp on how tall kd is but ad is taller than him
nba,not_removed,without shoes or with
nba,not_removed,same and that is rare because jojo has dwarfed some bigggg dudes this year
nba,not_removed,youre right i just remember checking out his shot charts when he played with the wolves and concluding that he started shooting the midrange under adelman i guess didnt remember that correctly
nba,not_removed,even more impressive since his team was that bad
nba,not_removed,two years ago draymond was a good pf he came second in dpoy voting that season klay thompson is a top sg that was the consensus at the time as well curry was a unanimous mvp because nobody else was playing at a real mvp level again we were missing one allstar caliber point guard with our other allstar caliber point guard playing on one knee and we were still playing at their level dont forget the warriors bench is not good anymore so yes they added kevin durant but weve played kevin durant amazingly so far this season hes shooting like when guarded by solomon hill and weve also added defensive stoppers to our team while making the bench much deeper ad is better than ever especially against the warriors this year and if jrue and reke were healthy id bet on us taking at least one game nobody is saying wed win the series theres no chance of that but we could absolutely take a game from them
nba,not_removed,time for new years eve alcohol
nba,not_removed,having zero offensive help kind of makes it hard to shoot well
nba,not_removed,it wasnt a big deal but in a series that was decided by points every small difference matters
nba,not_removed,i mean despite having the best record in the league atm the warriors have lost of their games against top teams they do have more talented starting lineup this season but i think they are gonna have harder time in the playoffs
nba,not_removed,this is a pretty reasonable post but youre getting downvoted just because of the way thread is swinging and flair
nba,not_removed,iggy had the back of a year old that was a pretty huge issue too that lebron block only happened at all because his back was so fucked he couldnt dunk
nba,not_removed,you miss the fact that those blocks in the quarter made the cavs not attack the rim while he was on the court it was possession away without bogut dont forget when ezelli got the ball stolen from his hands by love would never happen with bogut you are understimatting bogut and contradicting yourself bogut is much better than fe or av and he wouldnt have those problems at the same level i think kerr shouldnt have played them as much but with iggy injured he couldnt have dray play the as much
nba,not_removed,i mean love had a freaking concussion last finals and everyone seems to forget that too
nba,not_removed,bet you didnt even watch the series
nba,not_removed,apparently you cant read
nba,not_removed,see everyone says that steph was off but what just like in soccer he went through a purple patch good players will look amazing over half season stretch before reverting back to normal so i think he was playing over his head and we will never see the normal steph in finals as that isnt the regular steph
nba,not_removed,kevin love was there he was just shit
nba,not_removed,if youre taller than kd then youre probably foot or more
nba,not_removed,with the at the combine was also in shoes hes waaaay longer than he is tall tho he really looks like a huge freak on the court dude had a at the time sheeeeesshh
nba,not_removed,im not saying you cant take a game but i am saying that people acting as if its a guarantee are wrong youre barely an seed right now and as much as i absolutely love jrue holiday hes not that much of a game changer especially against the warriors
nba,not_removed,why isnt the warriors bench good anymore iggy declined and they dont have a good defensive backup but the rest of the bench looks better ian clark has gotten a lot better and west has looked like an upgrade over speights if they are gonna play klay andor kd with the unit like they have been doing i think their bench lineup is more than enough to get it done
nba,not_removed,it didnt in prior series or matchups the heat turned it up a notch and he couldnt handle it
nba,not_removed,still well below regular season numbers
nba,not_removed,at the same time though bogut has always been an injury risk to be quite honest out of your entire team not suffering any injuries during the run i was most surprised by bogut he absolutely killed your chances in and he has always been an injury risk as a player my main point is that with his injury it wasnt really that surprising and every team gets them on their runs to a championship and that is just how the dominoes fall its honestly like this across all sports in my opinion for example the nfl is the worse when it comes to injuries around playoff time nowadays by the time the super bowl comes it really ends up feeling like ok who had a pretty ok defense and offense and has the least amount of injuries as far as the nba just look at some of the main competition in the west the clippers and grizzlies for example have constantly had setbacks with injuries hell you could argue that the thunders entire franchise and its limited window w durant closed because of injuries
nba,not_removed,i know thats not what you are saying but i dont think its fair to say something like oh the warriors can only beat bad teams think about how close of those losses were a loss in overtime to the rockets a point loss to the cavs that had shit refs for both teams throughout the entire game the other one is a blowout loss to the spurs in the first game of the season i dont know i dont think they are playing to their potential but im not worried yet
nba,not_removed,nah im predicting a lakers type of deal spend the entire season trying to figure out how to play as a team then dominate in the postseason
nba,not_removed,beating bad teams and only losing rarely to good teams early in the season is what you want more than anything else
nba,not_removed,not once have i seen someone mention that cavs were perfectly healthy and every warrior on the floor was crippled even though they were playing
nba,not_removed,hold up are you saying that currys back to back mvp seasons where he broke the point record then destroyed his own record in one of the greatest offensive seasons of all timewas just a hot streak
nba,not_removed,he had a concussion people love to forget about
nba,not_removed,exactly
nba,not_removed,jrue is a huge game changer for us
nba,not_removed,regular season playoffs the heat played defense completely differently in the ecf lebron was quick enough and long enough to prevent rose from shooting jumpers and when rose drove past lebron and he often did dont listen to the people who didnt actually watch the games the entire heat defense would collapse on him they dared chicago to beat them with the ball in someone elses hands and it worked because the bulls were garbage offensively they were seriously sagging feet off their assignments every play bulls players like korver and deng missed countless open shots and put that much more pressure on rose to basically go on offense
nba,not_removed,no it definitely hurt no matter what he had no offensive help on that team and thats what kept him from really competing give him someone like current jimmy butler at shooting guard and they probably finish off the heat or at least take them to
nba,not_removed,you dont game plan and play an opponent or times in a row
nba,not_removed,couldnt the same be said about kyrie as youre saying about bogut
nba,not_removed,yea i understand that i wanted to add earlier but forgot that we should get clearer picture how they fair against top teams once they play them again im personally just a bit paranoid that were getting a repeat of the last season
nba,not_removed,i like your enthusiasm but i dont think the roster as is can do there just isnt enough defensive power without a rim protector for as good as its been so far i think that draymond does deserve the credit javale will keep getting better by the playoffs but he cant play more than minutes at a time just like like speights zaza and damien jones are our only options for starting centers right now and i dont see how any team is willing to trade someone to help us
nba,not_removed,and curry was hurt from the rockets series both teams had their fair share of injuries so its no use to try and discredit either or
nba,not_removed,so whats your point
nba,not_removed,no they wouldnt they were comprehensively dismantled lebron wade and bosh in were not going to lose to any team
nba,not_removed,tru
nba,not_removed,yes
nba,not_removed,no chance you get close to i meant it as a regular season is more for the team to develop chemistry postseason dominate similar to the cavs last year but this team is uniquely talented i mean curry sucked in cleveland and the team was still up double digits in the just gotta learn not to get complacent and let the momentum turn id say first two rounds are sweeps wcf in or less finals in or less depending on how hard bronkyrie can get going
nba,not_removed,im not discounting anything love had a concussion last finals thats all im saying
nba,not_removed,thats my point
nba,not_removed,they almost lost to the pacers or are you just going to keep forgetting that fact they almost lost the ecfs and the finals they were a miracle ray allen three pointer away from losing three finals out of four
nba,not_removed,your time in sun ended lakers fan and youre bitter lebron is better than your boy kobe its okay to admit it
nba,not_removed,okay kid what ever helps you sleep at night
nba,not_removed,complaining about that play or the ejection theyre not the same thing
nba,not_removed,doc said that he was pointing out to the refs about them forgetting about mos and which you can see the ref motion and also hear the in game commentators call following the play when they threw austin out for whatever reason they called an on that doc rivers said you can see it on the replay they absolutely called an and they forgot to give us a free throw so i called a timeout and said hey you forgot to give us a free throw and they didnt know what we were talking about and i said no you forgot to give us a free throw come on you guys dont know what youre doing and that was it
nba,not_removed,could have also been that they did not give mo the and because it happened simultaneously i think doc was ejected some time after the first scuffle when austin was ejected
nba,not_removed,yes
nba,not_removed,we out here fam
nba,not_removed,chaos reigns
nba,not_removed,parity
nba,not_removed,pretty crazy for a team to win six games in one night
nba,not_removed,fuuuuuck all kinds of disappointment
nba,not_removed,hooray for the underdogs
nba,not_removed,good thing we werent playing
nba,not_removed,macs won times today s
nba,not_removed,another reason why i love basketball anyone can win any given night
nba,not_removed,when i told my wife who isnt a sports fan about how all games tonight were won by the lower ranking team she said they all lost it must be a space jam thingy
nba,not_removed,maybe not important per se illustrious
nba,not_removed,this guy is gonna be a great player steal of the draft imo
nba,not_removed,along with ullis and isaiah thomas usher them in the smurfs are coming
nba,not_removed,he has great potential but im worried about this fit playing limited minutes behind kyrie on a team competing for a championship might not be a perfect situation i dont think hell see the court enough time to make an offensive impact that fully outweighs the cost of being a defensive target especially as a rookie
nba,not_removed,saw this dude dominate in a few games at summer league super explosive and fun to watch ill be rooting for him
nba,not_removed,not gonna argue with a guy having prediction background like
nba,not_removed,average american height boys we out here
nba,not_removed,he probably wont be a net positive player as a rookie because most arent especially second rounders but i dont think its a bad fit backup point is the biggest hole on the team after delly left and mo retired so he is going to have plenty of opportunity to play at least at the beginning of the year there isnt a ton of pressure on the cavs reg season and he likely wont be in the game when it really matters unless he highly exceeds expectations but he will get chances to play in big games against second units and backup point guards if he is capable that seems like a good spot for him to learn and have success to me
nba,not_removed,youre talking like kyrie isnt going to get injured and miss time this season
nba,not_removed,holy shit
nba,not_removed,damn what a god
nba,not_removed,daily reminder that everyone who shat on him and made dumbass statements about lebron should delete their accounts
nba,not_removed,damn i shoulda wrote it out somewhere i foresaw the cavs winning when down there was no way that lebron was going to let the healthy cavs squad lose
nba,not_removed,whats the cavs plan b at backup pg if he doesnt work out
nba,not_removed,going back and looking at the morning after thread for game is one of my simple pleasures
nba,not_removed,i fully agree with this statement
nba,not_removed,reg season sign a vet like norris cole chalmers or hinrich post season lebron is essentially backup pg anyway so its really not that important unless kyrie misses time
nba,not_removed,mcrae and shump can both fill in at the in a crunch although its not ideal
nba,not_removed,theyre looking at players
nba,not_removed,also dont you guys have a trade exception cavs have made some great moves around the trade deadline for a long time now even if you dont have an exception shump is a prime candidate for a trade now that you added dunleavy
nba,not_removed,im really hoping for a bounceback year for shump if hes healthy i think hell be a net positive
nba,not_removed,we arent even sure yet if dunleavy can play much back injuries at are no joke i would not say shump is tradeable unless we get back a better wing but nobody else is doing that we do have a tpe but not a whole lot of tradeable assets to go with it since we traded a with av last year
nba,not_removed,everyone watch for the kick after the dunk
nba,not_removed,is warriors assistant trainer who has to stretch draymonds hammies the most dangerous job in america
nba,not_removed,natural celebratory motion
nba,not_removed,rip chance the rapper
nba,not_removed,wat
nba,not_removed,thats just him practicing his jump shot warming up for when he gets subbed in
nba,not_removed,reverse poster might be the best poster
nba,not_removed,really tried hard with this shitpost
nba,not_removed,natural celebrating motion
nba,not_removed,lol i thought it was gonna be sending lowry to the ground from the raptors game
nba,not_removed,i posted this earlier and it got deleted lol
nba,not_removed,how does one end a life with that weak ass dunk
nba,not_removed,he needed those cocoa butter kisses
nba,not_removed,that kick was not even close to hitting anyone lame attempt at a joke by op
nba,not_removed,pls do it celtics
nba,not_removed,cmon bogut you know you look better in green
nba,not_removed,i dont think tim macmahon from espn dallas has bad sources i think his report is but its not a given that he signs in cleveland
nba,not_removed,he has the perfect role for celtics he would fit better in that team than the cavs
nba,not_removed,would rather cavs take him than larry sanders tbh we can abuse him on pnr like irving did to him last year had to take him out immediately sanders quicker feet not so much
nba,not_removed,is this guy reliable at all
nba,not_removed,bogut might be a bit hurt about his departure but as he said it was for a hall of famer in his prime really the only way to be angry about it is if he thinks we should have dumped iguodala instead im pretty sure he hates the cavs more after finals battles and all the talk that went back and forth
nba,not_removed,he fits better on the celtics but he wants to be on a contender
nba,not_removed,why would he choose boston over cavs cavs only team where he can win a title thats not gs
nba,not_removed,to be fair this was posted from the boston globe so take that with a grain of salt
nba,not_removed,sign sanders and lets move on
nba,not_removed,i still think we get him
nba,not_removed,does anyone remember how joe johnson was supposed to sign with the cavs
nba,not_removed,will do bud
nba,not_removed,sanders has more potential but is a huge question mark if they worked him out and arent signing him im going to assume theres a reason
nba,not_removed,in my limited knowledge i would prefer sanders but i trust the fo
nba,not_removed,i mean its not like bogut will be starting in the event that he does sign with them tt and love worked more than fine for the cavs last year
nba,not_removed,thats my thinking too any bitterness he has towards us would be much stronger against the team that got him hurt and denied him another ring
nba,not_removed,id think he wants to play where he will get to showcase for his last multiyear contract in the offseason
nba,not_removed,boston is a contender they are a top team they are not favorites by any stretch but they certainly are in contention
nba,not_removed,contender so hed like to go to the finals id like to think that boston yes i know has a chance to upset the cavs
nba,not_removed,only if he wants a bigger role
nba,not_removed,thanks lucky
nba,not_removed,did the cavs work him out already
nba,not_removed,i would prefer the one who has played a basketball game in last years
nba,not_removed,this he can play behind thompson and love when hes back or he can be the only guy on the celtics who can grab a rebound i know where hell look more effective
nba,not_removed,at this point of his career hes got a ring already might as well sign with a team that can get him the highest pay day
nba,not_removed,what is your argument here that hed have a higher chance of making the finals by being on a team that could upset the cavs rather than being on the cavs who are expected to make the finals what
nba,not_removed,no
nba,not_removed,only if lebron is not on the court if lebron is no chance we have a chance to meet in the conference finals but all the lower seeds have a good shot at beating us
nba,not_removed,well not a legitimate chance if his primary goal is to go to the finals why choose a team that has a very small chance over the heavy favorite
nba,not_removed,hey thanks man
nba,not_removed,boston has no chance
nba,not_removed,dont cavs only have one center though surely hed get enough minutes there especially if he plays to a passable level
nba,not_removed,ya reportedly
nba,not_removed,yeah we did and from everything ive heard we were keen on him i think we would just prefer bogut bc he is proven and has playoff experience so i think if bogut doesnt come u can fully expect us to sign sanders
nba,not_removed,the celtics also worked him out and immediately came out and said he didnt do very well if ainge would rather have zeller than him he must have been pretty bad
nba,not_removed,and hasnt been arrested in the last months
nba,not_removed,hes gonna get his money either way this year
nba,not_removed,no
nba,not_removed,yeah i think we have a shot at the ecf but beating the cavs in a game series seems pretty unrealistic
nba,not_removed,the celtics are one lebron injury away from having a chance tho
nba,not_removed,well our only center only plays minutes a game so i dont think its really not having enough centers but rather our small ball style just dont really have a good role for him maybe theyll figure something out and change the pace with him out on the court but right now im having a hard time envisioning him on our team
nba,not_removed,man if sanders is of what he was hell be so great for you guys with the signing of detonation williams the only whole in your roster is a lack of size on the bench fuck
nba,not_removed,lmao hes so full of it
nba,not_removed,lowe post bill simmons duncd on eye on basketball the vertical the starters
nba,not_removed,just a tip reddits search function is for shit if you google reddit nba podcasts it will be much more fruitful i found this link right at the top of the page and it seems thorough its months old though so some may be defunct i will say though that the ringers nba pod is aggressively bad and should be avoided at all costs
nba,not_removed,this has most likely been posted million times but here i go anyway this is the one ive seen today
nba,not_removed,a great pod from australia is believe the hype
nba,not_removed,if you want nerdcasts real gm lowe post those two are most informative with least amount of personality jalen and jacoby are looseygoosey with facts but talk alot of basketball rumors and old jalen stories best over the top shit mill humor is sources say on ringer pods if you want a blend of everything the drop by the starters on fridays is pretty good too
nba,not_removed,check out the locked on podcast network its new but david locke has been doing pods for the utah jazz for the last years he has recently expanded to a show about the nba at large and has also expanded to shows on several other teams in the league all done by their color comentators analysis top notch and in my opinion the best place to learn about basketball on a daily basis
nba,not_removed,i disagree with the starters i mean i love the show but the analysis just isnt all that great
nba,not_removed,truehoop nba lockdown usually some mix of amin elhassin tom harberstroh ethan strauss pablo torre jorge sedano and izzy guttierez among those podcasts
nba,not_removed,even better google siteredditcomrnba and whatever you are searching for
nba,not_removed,search bar definitely works for stuff this simple
nba,not_removed,i disagree with your disagreement i think the entertainment value they offer more than makes up for whatever analysis they are lacking
nba,not_removed,if it does it does i totally stopped using reddits search function for anything but subreddits years ago
nba,not_removed,lmao the nba stays trolling the clippers by giving them that white woman ref so often
nba,not_removed,people always like to bitch it was a foul on kilpatrick and it was an automatic tech for crossing the half court and the tech was called by the other ref so stop bitching people
nba,not_removed,i wonder if anyone heard what he said
nba,not_removed,the power of lauren holtkamp
nba,not_removed,that first tech call really is one of the most ridiculous ive ever seen
nba,not_removed,cant say shit about how trash she is because the nba will fine you and the butt hurt feminists will rip you apart online
nba,not_removed,austin has seen the worst you can see that on his face
nba,not_removed,im gonna walk you back
nba,not_removed,cp slapped him in the face before he dribbked last i checked thats a foul
nba,not_removed,if i wasnt aware lauren holtkamp played college basketball i would just assumed shed never seen a game in her life with the shit she calls
nba,not_removed,probably the worst ref in nba history but no one can really ever say anything because its sexist in todays world shed fit in in international play with her love for blowing whistles on plays that should be overlooked at the nba level
nba,not_removed,its an automatic tech if he crosses mid court
nba,not_removed,i mean the nba fines you no matter who you criticize
nba,not_removed,butt hurt feminists will rip you apart simple solution to avoiding that one just stay away from tumblr holy hell that place is something else
nba,not_removed,she might be bad but how do you know she is the worst you are talking out of your ass here
nba,not_removed,yup and doc should know better it was his mistake and instead of accepting it and throws a fit and embarrasses himself
nba,not_removed,shes supposed to be the second worst ref in the league according to an anonymous poll of players i dont see what she did wrong here though ken mauer was the one who called the t
nba,not_removed,i mean its not like she was there for tor vs sac and from what i gathered in the video doc deserved the tech because of walking too far
nba,not_removed,tony brothers tho
nba,not_removed,scott foster and the neil degrasse tyson lookalike come to mind
nba,not_removed,why would someone that has been following basketball religiously for the past years be talking out of their ass because you think fans cant rate refs anyone that thinks shes good is talking out of their ass
nba,not_removed,tony brothers lol
nba,not_removed,no because you dont watch basketball to rate the refs do you even notice the refs when their calls are correct no you dont you just notice them when they make mistakes and because holtkamp is a female ref she stands out and you remamber her mistakes more than other refs
nba,not_removed,of course i notice correct and incorrect calls that comes with watching and playing basketball just bc you think it has to do with a woman is your own misguided judgement watch enough and you notice who sticks out like a sore thumb same way you know whos a borderline nba player and whos elite just bc i dont specifically watch basketball to rate refs doesnt mean i cant form my own conclusions
nba,not_removed,drummond needs a pass first pg reggie jackson is ass
nba,not_removed,chuck was right about reggie he does think hes better than he is detroit had such great stretch while he was out
nba,not_removed,wouldve had a if reggie would pass instead of throw the game away in the
nba,not_removed,reggie lost todays game
nba,not_removed,when he said they got a buncha guys who made a lil money and all my ears heard was reggie jackson when they started the show with the graphic about detroit starting then going to shit the next games and playing like points worse d reggie jackson like damn bro if it smells like shit look under your shoe
nba,not_removed,nah man shooting that shitty from the killed yall
nba,not_removed,well i didnt catch the whole game since im not a detroit fan but from what i saw in the last minutes jackson tried at least times with no effort driving to the basket failing all of them with one of them blocked he even had a pass to drummond while he was surrounded and opted for the shot maybe this vas svg call im not sure
nba,not_removed,they shot that bad but were still able to get a pt lead while at the time from they could have won the game but reggie took some atrocious possessions late smart had the back and over and the missed open layup that both werent capitalized on
nba,not_removed,yup even with the terrible shooting they brought it back and did have a point lead some bad possessions in a row took their chance away
nba,not_removed,many smart people thought they had a good chance of winning games before the year guess how many wins they are on pace for there isnt anything groundbreaking going on here when healthy they have a shot at being the best seed in the east i probably wouldnt pick them in a playoff series vs hou lac gs or sa though its a good well rounded team those that can be top on both sides of the floor tend to do well in the nba thats where utah is george hill has just been everything they could ask for god they really need him though this offense just becomes so much easier to play against when hes not out there and static largely their guys are developing the way they want rudy is having his best year and somebody you have to account for now offensively rodney hood keeps adding subtle parts to his game trey lyles is playing smarter and learning how to integrate himself into the offensive effectively consistently they still have some issues late in games had two bad home loses this month to sac and mia blew a pt quarter lead to pho needed to get bailed out by a buzzer beater to beat dal at home were awful for quarters last night vs embiid less philly they still do some things that make you uneasy but its a very good roster that said they are at a spot where they cant keep everybody theyll have to pick between hill and favors i dont think theyll be able to keep all of hood lyles and exum either itll be rather interesting to see how they manage things they have to make decisions based off smaller sample sizes than they like and guys not being healthy for long stretches
nba,not_removed,i dont think ive heard anyone say a single word about the nuggets this year
nba,not_removed,yes talk about us please edit oh shit youre asking us to talk about us ill start with this our rebuild began in with the selection of gordon hayward in the draft then we sent deron williams to the nets for picks and stuff that got us derrick favors and enes kanter derrick favors and gordon hayward remain key parts of the team two of the most all around players at their position and can be argued as top players at both i like to argue too but i dont like to go too far enes kanter isnt well liked here anymore cause he demanded a trade and then shat on us on his way out said we had a crappy organization fan base coaches and stuff like that he was also a terrible defensive player we were a terrible defensive team before he was traded and then rudy gobert came into the pictureanother franchise player rudy was just a really tall long uncoordinated dude coming into the draft had foot injuries in the past too which made him fall but we saw his godly standing reach and had to pluck him hes one of the hardest working guys in the nba now evidenced by his growing ft and arguably the best interior defender in the league the change from kanter one of the worst defending centers in the league at the time to gobert the opposite was drastic and we found our groove in we won games that year after winning in the one before that we have this guy named alec who i really like who is really talented but he gets injured a lot rodney hood was taken in the draft year after rudy and was seen as a huge steal on draft day that hasnt changed and hes an above average sg for a youngling although hes pretty streaky of a shooter some say they think hell be our best offensive player soon enough i disagree but would be happy to see it come true then we drafted lyles point shooting big guy traded for george hill i assume you at least recognize the name and rounded out the roster in this past offseason giving us one of the most deep teams in the league its a good thing were deep cause like everyone gets injured on our team its a curse cause stock and malone never got injured oh yeah and hayward and gobert are both borderlineall star players so yeah theres your small minute breakdown of the jazz edit some more notes that im just typing up we play at the leagues second slowest pace and slowest over the last years pace adjusted we have a top offense and a top defense rudy gobert is a difference maker defensively to the team last year they were with him playing mins or less when he played more than glad we havent had to do something like this for him this year rudy gobert has a role offensively that he does incredibly well even if he doesnt have an arsenal of moves he is supposed to catch the ball and put it in the basket he leads the league in fg and fg adjusted for pointers and free throws aka ts dante exum was the fifth pick in the draft the one where we got hood and people hope he can be the pg of the future for the team tearing his acl before his second year set him back a ton and its like hes in a second rookie year although its the year weve had him on contract gordon hayward does everything really well people compare him to a watered down lebron hes also very buff now weve had a ton of issues at pg until this year when we got george hill hes been the best pg weve had since we traded dwill i love him hes smart a good shooter good facilitator calm clutch collected and a good defender gh makes gh better saying goes both ways cap space issues are about to be a real problem to not go into too much detail its essentially going to come down to a couple key decisions in our future like hill or favors and lyles or exum etc hayward is sure to get a m max this offseason which makes the whole situation stickier were generally a very good drafting team although we have trouble luring free agents year old joe johnson was the biggest name weve had sign here in free agency since memo okur and carlos boozer everything we do is centered around drafting good pieces and building around them
nba,not_removed,im a diehard clipper fan but am too into basketball to only follow one team i bought a jazz shirt two years ago after watching the first half of the season i feel like i bought great stock
nba,not_removed,people that are really smart about basketball recognize them but the truth is that they are just not a sexy team thats what keeps them under the radar for more casual fans like me
nba,not_removed,g o d b e r t
nba,not_removed,utah had the ranked record last year and currently are
nba,not_removed,i think that everybody recognizes that the jazz are a top team in the west when totally healthy they were the last team to blow out the rockets so you wont catch me sleeping on them
nba,not_removed,being a jazz fan since i was in kindergarten has led to a few things in my life hell i have elementary school journal entries where i was drawing scribbled stick figures of john stockton mad pridefandom for a small market team that is from a state that a lot of people laugh at or joke about disappointments aka always getting far but never quite far enough bulls vs jazz anyone we have one of the longest playoff appearance streaks in nba historynot currently just the jazz in general but nothing aside from two western conference titles to show for it it seems we are always on the cusp of greatness or of an amazing team but there is always something better becoming a jazz fan really means becoming a lover of the underdog and ive noticed it translate to my outlook when watching other teams play we also dont attract superstar calibur players unless we draft them being a fan of a small market team for life gives you a respect for players and fans who are loyal but mainly there is pride in the jazz there is a culture in the organization that ive always liked i like the way quinn snyder and the office handles things i like how the last few years have panned out and where we are now its exciting to watch the jazz and where they have come from a dominating teamstockton malone hornacek to a solid playoff team dwill boozer okur kerelinko to probably one of our worst stretches in history to now our lineup is finally healthy for the most part and we are only moving up i would love to see hill stay a jazzman he loves utah so far and the family aspect of things so i can see us signing him if you want my honest opinion id take him over favors i have a favors jersey even and love the guy but we need a pg like hill for our team to thrive gobert is loyal and i respect him so much for it he signed a nonmax contract to stay with us and always talks about how he loves the organization and team i see his ferocity and want to always be better note for anyone who doesnt know already gobert chose the number because he was drafted he wants to own that and prove that hes better than it hayward as much as he has improved and as much as i like him i honestly cannot say if he will stay after this offseason i know he has a family and likes it here but hes also competitive and wants to start winning now i think we are doing a great job of showing him that we are ready to win and the rebuild is reaching its completion i hope he can see that and realize the potential we have here in the next couple of years overall from the jazz you wont see as much flash as you might from a westbrook or lebron team you wont get as much media attention or national attention in general hell the jazz have like the lowest facebook and twitter followers out of all nba teams but you will get a loyal fanbase team that will stick with you as you stick with it the jazz play tough fundamental ball with a focus on defense thats not always the most exciting thing to watch but we have the team for it and seeing gobert swat cousinsgasolwhiteside is so satisfying xd well have our chance someday and i will be loyal until that day sorry for the long post
nba,not_removed,with the full squad im not afraid of anyone outside of the warriors id love that matchup with the clippers or rockets lets do that
nba,not_removed,issues late in games this year can be attributed to george hill missing lots of games jazz are in fourths when hes not on the court team worst and in fourths when hes on the court team best
nba,not_removed,i havent heard about the nuggets since the melo trade honestly
nba,not_removed,theyve quietly stockpiled a ton of moderatetohighpotential young players six players who were picks in the past three drafts as well as jokic
nba,not_removed,the jazz play basketball in the nba
nba,not_removed,no comment about joe ingles the best shooter in the league
nba,not_removed,nice writeup man real good look at how the current jazz came to be
nba,not_removed,our rebuild began in did we really start rebuilding in sure we drafted hayward that year but summer we were still trying to keep that williams team going we had to let matthews go but brought in other guys with expectations jefferson and bell williams then got traded and we started cycling guys like josh howard under corbin we backed into the seed and i distinctly recall the phrase retooling used rather rebuilding during those years also much debate about playing vets over young guys it wasnt until when we took on gss salary dump for picks and the criteria of defense discipline development were given to corbin that it was clear the fo wanted to rebuild that was the season we bottomed out then drafted at and after it we got a new coach
nba,not_removed,arguably the best interior defender in the league arguably fight me dog
nba,not_removed,you did buddy you did
nba,not_removed,have you seen gordon hayward lately hes looking damn buff
nba,not_removed,this tbh they are good and i love gordon hayward but i just feel like no one on their team is just a really exciting player they are all just good and play well kinda like the spurs tbh
nba,not_removed,tell that to uviperep
nba,not_removed,yeah they definitely need him but just saying oh the only reason for them is hes not out there everything is completely fine when hes out there like many jazz fans want to also isnt really living in reality this is a multi year trend if not having hill means you fall apart that at the end of gamesthis month alone you are blowing games at home vs mia or sac blowing pt leads to phoenix or needing buzzer beats vs dal at home to win it highlights quarter execution issues hill isnt just a magical elixir that cures all its literally a game sample size now with him of him playing this well people shouldnt rush to conclusions off that either that said they stay healthy theyll be fine have all the components of a strong regular season team its just they do things that can make you uneasy and it goes beyond just saying hill is the cure all
nba,not_removed,only reason they are relevant to me is because of tbh
nba,not_removed,yeah i shouldve mentioned him i actually thought i did but honestly ive just been out got my tonsils out and have been taking tons of oxy of it since wednesday so i have no idea what im saying on anything since then i probably have said a lot of regrettable things on reddit and twitter today and yesterday but its whatever
nba,not_removed,yeah i guess we didnt really fully commit to the rebuild until but i feel like it started with the drafting hayward and trading of dwill
nba,not_removed,i think they started off like and or something like that i remember watching hayward and gobert and really thinking they were way better than their record then the kanter trade helped everything out
nba,not_removed,this to this just wow
nba,not_removed,you are right they really do feel like spurs lite
nba,not_removed,quin snyder comes from the spurs organization and our gm was an assistant gm for the spurs so they see the benefit for that type of play but yeah definitely similar we even have diaw now xd
nba,not_removed,i dont know you uviperep but they jazz are mad spooky yo
nba,not_removed,i dont understand why you care about someone over the internets opinion on your team so much
nba,not_removed,im not intending to say that at all just trying to point out that injuries have still held us back from reaching our full potential this year and things are finally looking up while throwing a stat in there to try to help support my statement we arent suddenly going to stop losing leads or playing teams we shouldnt closely because of george hill there are problems beyond just our point guards and below the skin that help cause that but in the end of games but it sure will help a lot to have him rather than shelvin fking mack lol playing the sixers was ugly till the final quarter when hill showed us exactly that im not so sure we win that game with mack and exum running the point the whole game and were in a good position right now even with dealing with injuries a win or two extra if we hadnt been plagued isnt all that unlikely through right now that would push us into fourth place
nba,not_removed,wtf when did he get unbanned
nba,not_removed,mainly commenting because we occasionally see people trying to say weve been rebuilding forever or similarly underperforming for a long time both reflecting a lack of attention paid to our team with this as an excuse to figure out the timeline i think fo wanted to compete between and lindsey became gm summer and then the fo decided to actually rebuild during summer we didnt have a coach on board with the rebuild until the following summer when snyder was hired very much a transition period during those years
nba,not_removed,wait is that real or am i an idiot
nba,not_removed,thx
nba,not_removed,please dont call my team spooky
nba,not_removed,i dont understand why either but why does anything matter why do i care about my team at all because they happen to play where i live i havent even met anyone who actually plays for the team runs the team coaches the team etc so why do i even care about it in general maybe its because i like finding this to debate and that having this competitiveness is fun a question well never know in relation to us all but because i decided i want to care about how my team is seen i can say and defend them as much as i goddamn want to
nba,not_removed,its insane how much different we play when george hill plays i bet at the all star real we are at wins finishing at around injuries have been a bitch but if we can make a push towards the end of march we should have enough momentum to win the first round matchup and maybe take the round to games
nba,not_removed,yeah i agree with all of this you seem pretty reasonable with your outlook on the team which is goodand not often the case on reddit hopefully utah stays reasonably healthy they really have the potential to be the most fun league pass team the rest of the year if they do utahs in an interesting spot they are going to have to make a bunch of big decisions soon on many key players they cant keep both favors and hill long term they wont get to have a roster this deep again arguably and they are going to have to assess things based off a roster that hasnt been healthy at all the past two years its a tough spot but i think conversations like should favors be traded for the overall pick in next years draft will be a real thing in utahs front office this summer if the chance is there to get a top caliber playerand we all know utah to be a serous title threat needs more high end star power hopefully they are willing to offer a necessary package like lyles hood a future first you just cant pay all those guys long term anyway
nba,not_removed,totally real just google his rookie season or college to now lol
nba,not_removed,lol its just funny that you brought me up in a discussion i wasnt even involved in no need to rant its reddit
nba,not_removed,well you were pissing me off yesterday in multiple threads lol
nba,not_removed,boston was meh favorite part of your write up
nba,not_removed,the one unanswered question where was sam presti after he was killed was he somewhere in view
nba,not_removed,sly dog he doesnt have a chin
nba,not_removed,worst part was lou will was doing a great job closing the gap should have just kept him going since he was so hot
nba,not_removed,thats nasty
nba,not_removed,russ had tos in the quarter then had rest of the game just sayin
nba,not_removed,it sounds like they followed his lead pretty well tonight
nba,not_removed,his turnovers and this game prolly cast him the mvp imho
nba,not_removed,going for the cover up with his beard
nba,not_removed,first half
nba,not_removed,i doubt one game will be the decider lmao however if russ keeps playing how he has and harden keeps playing like this then i can see westbrook winning it
nba,not_removed,people said the exact same thing about westbrook when he went a few games ago people move on quickly
nba,not_removed,you right but even still he had in the quarter and only in the quarter the rest of the game thats awesome
nba,not_removed,at this point harden has to rest because if he shoots the way he does hes going to fuck up his wrist more
nba,not_removed,pace is up as well which helps but still amazing talent right now
nba,not_removed,more role players can stretch the floor star players have more space to operate
nba,not_removed,i hate all of you
nba,not_removed,funny to see a fair few of the people averaging under in take a step up and are now averaging over this season eg kemba brook lopez demar damian lillard
nba,not_removed,what is this thread
nba,not_removed,thats actually pretty crazy shame there is close to no real discussion here
nba,not_removed,season aint over yet
nba,not_removed,wait i missed the part where pace is up i watch too many jazz games
nba,not_removed,didnt kyrie average during the season source
nba,not_removed,we are in the golden age boys cherish it
nba,not_removed,pace is up as well which helps but still amazing talent right now
nba,not_removed,there have been about games in this season there were games in the season
nba,not_removed,also pace the amount of stretch bigs and the amount of being shot
nba,not_removed,pace is up as well which helps but still amazing talent right now
nba,not_removed,if anyone cares to look i was the first to say the thing after i take of the credit for setting ths masterpiece in motion
nba,not_removed,we need an expansion to dilute the talent yeah
nba,not_removed,pace is up might as well adjust for pace and discredit everything everyone in has done so far s
nba,not_removed,come on this guy made a real comment and you guys downvoted him lol
nba,not_removed,there could have been a lot of good discussion in this thread
nba,not_removed,downvote those comments to help stop this kind of thing from happening in the future
nba,not_removed,probably because it gets posted like every week
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,lmao downvotes
nba,not_removed,insert bernie sanders comment on inequality
nba,not_removed,im on board with this
nba,not_removed,i downvoted because of your flair
nba,not_removed,because memes
nba,not_removed,downvote those comments to help prevent this from occurring in the future
nba,not_removed,eh love the product hate the innovator
nba,not_removed,of the teams are of the contenders
nba,not_removed,keep fighting the good fight
nba,not_removed,rediculous
nba,not_removed,nah its probably more because pace is up as well which helps but still amazing talent right now
nba,not_removed,thats not innovating its s joke thats been done hundreds of times its the opposite of innovating
nba,not_removed,ridiculous
nba,not_removed,oh sure next youre gonna tell me that since billions of people have run usain bolt did nothing special
nba,not_removed,this is sure to swing the election
nba,not_removed,omg i cant even
nba,not_removed,this just might be the final domino to make texas a blue state
nba,not_removed,no
nba,not_removed,mavs championship confirmed
nba,not_removed,bumpgate
nba,not_removed,they won two games in a row against good teams the year they were the best team in the league how unexpected
nba,not_removed,meet you in the finals miami
nba,not_removed,yeah but were garbage right now just meant to be a fun little stat
nba,not_removed,dankest timeline
nba,not_removed,times the charm
nba,not_removed,some people really hate these specific baseball style stats like they are just supposed to be fun little stats you shouldnt draw crazy conclusions from them lol
nba,not_removed,best rivalry in the nba
nba,not_removed,obviously were repeating this year is what i took from it
nba,not_removed,honestly true and im sorry i overreacted but the norm of sports subreddits is to overreact to random stats that arent really that random but are still interesting you were right about baseball every specific first since in baseball is just one that is more interesting than relevant
nba,not_removed,wadeters vs dirk its almost
nba,not_removed,pistons did you see his team aswell
nba,not_removed,patrick ewing had a tough road in the playoffs • michael jordan • hakeem olajuwon • possessed reggie miller • david robinson and the spurs
nba,not_removed,also shaqs lakers in the late early
nba,not_removed,this is circular logic if you take any player with such a lengthy career you will find tons of great teams he will have run into and some of them will be considered great only because the said player was not able to beat them
nba,not_removed,kobe had to go through the duncan spurs the ssol suns the webber kings the big celtics and he won timmy had to go through shaqobe lakers the dirk mavs the ssol suns the durantwestbrook thunder the heatles and he won malone has less of an excuse and his numbers dropped in the postseason unlike most superstars
nba,not_removed,yeah he went around the lakers training staff and the dude who helped with his knee fucked everything up so he couldnt play
nba,not_removed,i was too young to remember the narratives but did anybody think detroit was a historically good team before they beat the lakers
nba,not_removed,alsomourning hardaway riley and the heat bird and the cs and isiahs bad boys
nba,not_removed,uh if someone was in the ecf instead of wcf for their whole careers their legacy will change by a lot and youre assuming everyone will face the same amount of great teams which is absurdly false come on try harder
nba,not_removed,irrelevant in this case but right hes an asshole
nba,not_removed,like clockwork this subreddit will ignore another conversation about the basketball legacy of a top player to ever live because of nonbasketball reasons
nba,not_removed,he got a year old prego is this like a known rumor or fact link me something
nba,not_removed,we could name another athletes who are losers in life but winners in sports never stopped us before mike vick ben roethlisberger ruben patterson kirk snyder charles smith hell even allen iverson went to jail for smacking a girl in the head with a chair and thats just to name a few so lets move the fuck on please
nba,not_removed,that was detroits first year of dominance under larry brown their mid season trade for rasheed solidified that roster they had an alltime great defense but no way were they considered favorites nobody noticed them until they won
nba,not_removed,no
nba,not_removed,but you listed teams over a year old career and sonics arent even champions so the criteria for great teams is fairly loose you dont think it is possible to compile a list like that for every player with a long career look at duncan he faced shaqkobe lakers pistons nash suns thunder and their three future mvps heatles kobepau lakers
nba,not_removed,dont forget the other children he abandoned one of which is a current nfl player
nba,not_removed,i mean its a helluva good reason but still lets just stick to talking basketball please
nba,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikidemetressbell
nba,not_removed,but you listed teams over a year old career and sonics arent even champions so the criteria for great teams is fairly loose you dont think it is possible to compile a list like that for every player with a long career im saying its tougher than everyone elses read pls
nba,not_removed,at least spell demetrius right
nba,not_removed,i am saying i am not convinced by your list he may have faced the hardest road but make a proper point with some well defined metrics and consistent logic
nba,not_removed,thats the wiki and thats how its spelled
nba,not_removed,i mean it doesnt take a genius to figure out that repeatedly facing a champ with mj a champ with a goat pg a potential goat center and a champ with another potential goat center throughout your career is pretty hard competition tougher than anyone else in fact im speaking on intangibles i dont get why its hard for you to understand that there wasnt really any other player besides the rest of those jazz team that stayed with malone who has faced tougher competition than that yes statistically you are bound to face pretty tough competition if you get deep into the playoffs but my point is karl malone just so happened to face the most difficult out of everyone
nba,not_removed,i know thats his name tho his name is spelled wrong
nba,not_removed,he ranks somewhere between kawhi leonard and james harden
nba,not_removed,better perimeter defenders kawhi butler mkg avery bradley danny green tony allen equal or players marcus smart khris middleton if hes not top ten hes something or
nba,not_removed,klay is very good but he plays with two perimeter defenders who are better than he is iggy and livingston one of the best defensive centers rip golden state warrior andrew bogut and the best free range help defender not named lebron
nba,not_removed,nah hes good but hes not one of the best also you forgot to mention avery bradley and iguodala
nba,not_removed,kawhi pg tony allen mkg avery bradley danny green roberson sefelosha lbj aminu iggy marcus smart are all better and im missing a few most likely he is really good but not top which isnt a slight
nba,not_removed,roberson is a better defender than klay
nba,not_removed,easy lol
nba,not_removed,sure
nba,not_removed,i dont understand why lebron is never on these lists
nba,not_removed,absolutely i dont think the warriors are nearly as good if they he isnt defending at a top level i dont know how you even missed avery bradley op but my top wing defenders in no particular order are bradley allen klay kawhi and mathews
nba,not_removed,bold
nba,not_removed,iguodala and george are also better
nba,not_removed,hasnt butlers defense fallen off the past couple years because of him carrying the offense
nba,not_removed,gotta put kcp up there
nba,not_removed,paul isnt better
nba,not_removed,ag
nba,not_removed,just wondering is mkg michael kiddgillchrist
nba,not_removed,roberson is better as well
nba,not_removed,i dont know about danny green
nba,not_removed,you must not watch regular season cavs games
nba,not_removed,because hes frequently hidden on the worse wing player during the regular season if you cant give full effort for the whole season you do not belong on a top list
nba,not_removed,in it did a little but he picked it up last year his defensive metrics just look worse because of his teamates weighing him down
nba,not_removed,i disagree
nba,not_removed,yes
nba,not_removed,green is definetly better than klay on defense
nba,not_removed,thats blatantly untrue
nba,not_removed,lebron is hidden on defense the fuck hes always guarding the other teams best perimeter player
nba,not_removed,and itll probably go back up since rondo and wade will be there to handle some of the offense
nba,not_removed,its a matter of size and length paul is too small to defend like klay can and does on a regular basis
nba,not_removed,greens one of those guys people forget is awesome at defense unless his shot is falling
nba,not_removed,uh no he would guard dunleavy against us instead of rose or butler and that was when we were a top seed before we broke down he does it against other teams too one day hell guard the good player and the next hell take a breather
nba,not_removed,when does klay guard on a regular basis paul usually guards pgs and is the best pg defender in the nba but will frequently switch onto and if they are starting to get hot its a small sample size but he did a great job at shutting durant down in stretches of the clippers series against the thunder a few years ago
nba,not_removed,in the matchups from the past year lebron was always on jimmy butler
nba,not_removed,whenever the opposing team has a good enough for him to guard and the point guard isnt so skilled that curry needs to be hidden its the fact that klay can guard anyone across those positions that makes him more valuable he did not shut down durant in that clippers series what actually happened is kd struggled with double teams in game and committed a bunch of stupid turnovers as a result he corrected that and it was never brought up again for the rest of that series paul and durant is one of the worst mismatches in this league not so much with thompson speaking of that series westbrook tore paul to absolute shreds during it thompson defends him better
nba,not_removed,you sure you were watching cavs games last year he was hidden the same way curry was hidden in defense always guarding the other teams worst player lebron spent most of his time on barnes bricking threes
nba,not_removed,he really wasnt lebron guarded dundun almost exclusively in that series
nba,not_removed,nope he was guarding dunleavysnell with jr smith or whoever else guarding butler
nba,not_removed,so against which teams does klay spend most of his time guarding the opposing your criteria seems to be incredibly narrow whenever this situations come up iguodala generally comes in and takes primary duty on the opposing not klay
nba,not_removed,knicks jazz and pacers klay does guard more guards than forwards but thats out of necessity not that he cannot guard if required more of him thats what i mean by versatility iguodala and klay arent always sharing the floor warriors most played lineup last year was currythompsonrushgreenbogut
nba,not_removed,orly
nba,not_removed,well ill be fucked
nba,not_removed,gonna throw out something and may get some hate for it andrew wiggins is very athletic
nba,not_removed,somebody finally watched a wolves game
nba,not_removed,hes got or steals already
nba,not_removed,he was never that bad of a defender
nba,not_removed,athletic as fuck
nba,not_removed,finally
nba,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkjnarxyrfss
nba,not_removed,hes alright on d tho
nba,not_removed,also helps that the kings cant seem to get a handle on the ball
nba,not_removed,man i could just replay him sprinting over and overits almost as if hes a mix of a track and field athlete and a basketball player
nba,not_removed,looks good
nba,not_removed,can you imagine if he treated every game like hes playing the cavs omg
nba,not_removed,b b b but my circle jerk
nba,not_removed,never that bad onball but awful offball extremely inactive hands and general lack of interest in monitoring passing lanes attacking the glass etc
nba,not_removed,horrendous help defense has made huge strides as of late
nba,not_removed,yes he is but i think he has potential to not only be a good defender but a borderline all nba defender
nba,not_removed,the stars of track and field are beautiful people
nba,not_removed,i mean hes dropped in straight games including tonight he just got his as i type this so while hes not going all out like cavs games hes been stepping up
nba,not_removed,with a lot of big guys i kind of worry about doing this while it is good to be able to step out and hit a most bigs arent going to be able to catch the ball out there and actually take it to the rim or make plays when they do get closed out on i have felt this way about kevin love anthony davis and most centers that decide to add a its like dude youre going to turn yourself into channing frye if you dont have the supplementary skills to be on the perimeter but blake has great handles and passing so why not
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,steph curry ready to extend range shoot more from literally downtown
nba,not_removed,i dont necessarily think falling in love with the shot is a good idea but shooting it confidently from there is great was worried there for a sec teams would love if blake kept felling in love with his midrange and three point game the clippers are at their best when hes a physical driver
nba,not_removed,league fucked
nba,not_removed,if defenses give it to him he should take the shot but if hes taking shots that are contested or opting a for driving when he has a lane then its a bad call i think the goal is to be able to shoot a decent open so defenses cant sit back and leave him open
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,heard this shit with anthony davis
nba,not_removed,flashback friday to my fav buzzer beater of all time the game that went into overtime because bledsoe swatted a game winning layup bledsoe be scary at times
nba,not_removed,clippers are getting smart
nba,not_removed,really playing to his strengths
nba,not_removed,reminds me of the videos by youtube user scrimptioussoda where don nelson tells all his players to only shoot even if theyre
nba,not_removed,its a natural progression you cant keep expecting to hang your nuts on peoples heads for your whole career to easy to get hurt that way i just hope he shoots in the flow of games and not isos where everyone just stops and watches him chuck
nba,not_removed,he has said this before
nba,not_removed,signing josh smith not even once
nba,not_removed,did he have a broke ass midrange shot when he came in the league he was autofuckingmatic from ft last year when not injured seriously been spending time putting up shots
nba,not_removed,do the clippers want to lose
nba,not_removed,called it
nba,not_removed,extend shooting ranges not closed fists
nba,not_removed,every single offseason
nba,not_removed,clippers ready to miss playoffs fall into lottery
nba,not_removed,kevin love anthony davis and most centers that decide to add a dont forget serge ibaka has the hands and he has the shot but nothing to create his own shot i really wish he would have developed an inside game instead or at least worked on his handles more it was beautiful watching the or times a season he would actually drive and yam it home
nba,not_removed,i sort of disagree about the bigs particularly love and bosh them shooting open is the result of lebron collapsing a defense meaning their man left them to help on lebron if their man is close enough to contest them still that means lebron just went on a drive and then theres rarely a reason for him to pass out because hes such an elite slasher the goat slasher imo
nba,not_removed,i would put love in a separate category he has a legit release unlike many of these other big men
nba,not_removed,good point blake is probably the one big guy in the league whod be getting a straight upgrade than a side grade that being said i cant believe anthony davis is still not great on the perimeter with the ball he should be trying to be like kd
nba,not_removed,the point isnt to have big men turning into perimeter players who do everything a guard does including going to the rim from the point line the point is to develop a point shot that pulls the defender to the point line so imagine a rim protector like dwight getting pulled out to the point line and then a slasher attacking the rim
nba,not_removed,except you know frye can actually shoot the lights out compared to most other bigs stepping out to
nba,not_removed,this ruined the heat in and almost if it werent for lebron and ray allen saving them having bosh as a dominant mid range player was far more better than having him sit on the perimeter
nba,not_removed,i agree with you i feel like bigs should just up their inside game and expand on that midrange jump shot whilst i agree he might pull a big player outside i feel like its ineffective however a big transition open is definitely viable see your big man limping his way on transition dish him the ball on the line for an open and see if he hits it
nba,not_removed,still does it at a clip
nba,not_removed,the switch during the rs will help reduce wear and tear at least
nba,not_removed,nah were best when he is doing everything just driving usually ends up in post up situations that can sometimes stall ball movement and waste possessions when he mixes it up it opens up a lot more on the floor and shooting the can do even more
nba,not_removed,what midrange game yes but if hes shooting from three it absolutely helps the clips for him to shoot threes rather than the midrange jumpers he usually shoots
nba,not_removed,problem with him being a physical driver is it gasses him out really quickly and with the heavy minutes he is consistently forced to play it very clearly affects him in the quarter
nba,not_removed,yeah if he falls in love with the hell turn into derrick coleman and antoine walker
nba,not_removed,this at least till it becomes consistent do that for a year or two then when he truly has a feel for the shot he can take some heat checks lol
nba,not_removed,i miss baze
nba,not_removed,anthony davis trained all summer only to be a worse ball shooter than boogie
nba,not_removed,actually this is the first time blake has said it talking heads have speculated about it for the past years but blake has always refuted it until now
nba,not_removed,or he could be demarcus cousins and do both cousins shot last season and made exactly while also averaging an insane regular season blake wont touch those numbers because he coasts during the season to preserve his body and kicks into gear for the playoffs the preservation is probably the single biggest reason why hes diversified his game and isnt just attempting to jam the ball at every possible opportunity like he did early on
nba,not_removed,i think longterm its the right move when they get older they probably wont have the hops or quickness to get shots off as easily posting up against yearolds stretch bigs are all the rage now being able to shoot will limit their physical contact and itll extend their careers
nba,not_removed,its because donovan played him as an sg and roberson as a pf on offense ibaka lost a lot of the orb and pnr opportunities he used to get on o and he started competing with adams and kanter instead of perkins and thabeet for boards
nba,not_removed,love shooting threes has been part of his game since high school hes been a good shooter every year but his rookie year plus love is a fantastic passer for a big man
nba,not_removed,why let him just play to his strengths tim duncan or kg didnt need to shoot threes to be first ballot hof players neither does ad
nba,not_removed,he can my point is basically that the most damage you can do if you can only spot up shoot is drawing one defender to you sure that has value it opens things up for others but thats not a star level of impact its a role player level like channing frye and it can kill possessions if the team thinks the stretch big is open and throws it to him but he gets closed out on now hes holding the ball and cant really attack from that spot someone has to come get a handoff to even start the offense going again
nba,not_removed,not really the reality is that when you have a guy like lebron who you can give the ball to every play knowing hell produce either a layup or open consistently then having love or bosh in the mid range hurts the team more than helping it you dont need a big in the lane thats close enough to help on lebron
nba,not_removed,yeah he ends up getting stripped a lot in the low post especially when the ball sticks
nba,not_removed,just let him be a laker fan
nba,not_removed,not to mention serge fits perfectly on every team with his skillset
nba,not_removed,love is also very good at the pump fake dribble shoot after the defender flies by he can also put it on the floor and pull up for a mid range shot his passing is pretty good too and when hes getting the ball it usually means the defense has already collapsed hes pretty good at getting the ball swinging around the court on the way to the open man i like love and think hes going to be great this year
nba,not_removed,kg used to shoot
nba,not_removed,lmao what laker fan fucked ur girl
nba,not_removed,yeah when he played for the wolves his pump fake was money i remember a defender would run out to contest the three he would pump fake jab step then just nail it he was so good his second to last year in minnesota
nba,not_removed,i dont got a girl but im sure laker fans have fucked girls that ive fucked before lol i love laker fans clown most my family are laker fans
nba,not_removed,what a weird thing to assume
nba,not_removed,exskalibur
nba,not_removed,if you dont like that you dont like nba basketball
nba,not_removed,this kid was at one point the number one pick on draft express
nba,not_removed,he looks like my three month old cousin
nba,not_removed,just looked up the guy hes bigger than kat but very raw
nba,not_removed,wow they let him off the bench
nba,not_removed,skals gonna be fun to watch on this awful kings team
nba,not_removed,give this man more minutes
nba,not_removed,i knew we shoulda gotten him instead of siakam
nba,not_removed,that was super fun to watch but it was a travel lol
nba,not_removed,it looks like he took steps
nba,not_removed,dont mean to be a dick but theres a ton of players that are bigger than kat doesnt mean shit
nba,not_removed,he takes a dribble though
nba,not_removed,are you trying to tell me that marshall plumlee is worse than kat
nba,not_removed,holy shit youre right it happens so quickly lol
nba,not_removed,i mean it was basically games i would expect no less
nba,not_removed,for years i have been ultimately frustrated by the lack of consitency in nba officiating i understand you cant get every call right i would just like a little consistency from gametogame and reftoref there are very little repercussions for refs that make mistakes im just sick and tired of it
nba,not_removed,lots of extra time though it only makes sense
nba,not_removed,doesnt include the tech schroder shouldve gotten for slamming the ball down
nba,not_removed,whoever just bit on that parsons pump fake feet behind the line is just silly
nba,not_removed,these reports normally cover the last two minutes and a couple of incorrect calls is common here the report covers the last two minutes plus four overtimes or minutes of play times the usual timespan incorrect calls with favoring one team and favoring the other does not seem unusual
nba,not_removed,may not be unusual but is it acceptable
nba,not_removed,yes its part of the game its unrealistic to demand perfection and one incorrect call actually has much less effect in basketball than in other sports because theres so much scoring a call that costs a football team a touchdown a baseball team a run a hockey team a goal or a soccer team a goal is much more devastating than a call that costs a basketball team a bucket
nba,not_removed,well like i said in a previous comment i understand you cant get every call right so i certainly do not expect perfection however i feel like the consistency is the biggest issue who even knows what a foul is anymore no one we need some consistency and some more accountability i just feel like not a game goes by without me screaming at the refs from my living room
nba,not_removed,the brooklin duo is already promising
nba,not_removed,best point guard brook has played with in his career other than postasb deron williams
nba,not_removed,take him on a date already lin
nba,not_removed,fuck brooklyn but i like all of your players maybe we can get a real rivalry started too bad we dont have lopez still
nba,not_removed,really hope brook can stay healthy hes become underrated
nba,not_removed,theyre the same age and lin was hoping to get an offer from stanford good job stanford
nba,not_removed,he has soft hands giggidy
nba,not_removed,brooklin bridge hype
nba,not_removed,soplayoffs
nba,not_removed,your team is going to make your life harder bro
nba,not_removed,read that as he can pick and poop pick and roll and was trying to reconcile brooks bowel movement to ball movement
nba,not_removed,ill believe it when i see it
nba,not_removed,well he wont rebound so have fun with that
nba,not_removed,for the first time in a few years im kind of excited for the nets season to start
nba,not_removed,love the optimism and love jeremy lin but this is incredibly irrelevant
nba,not_removed,he also cant defend the pick roll
nba,not_removed,linsanity brook lin in brooklyn makes me think were extras in a fucking movie if you write this shit youd be laughed out of the writers room for being too corny
nba,not_removed,i thought jeremy lin was on the hornets
nba,not_removed,he just cant rebound
nba,not_removed,hes going to make my life so much easier towards wins
nba,not_removed,everything but stay on the court consistently
nba,not_removed,yeah if he stays healthy
nba,not_removed,everything except rebound and stay healthy
nba,not_removed,theyre still only winning games
nba,not_removed,lin is due for another bromantic relationship too
nba,not_removed,brooklin couldve happened a long time ago but stanford didnt want lin who went to palo alto hs right down the street
nba,not_removed,i hope lin can get his over that alone will drive up his value a lot hes been improving his drives to the left and also his defense
nba,not_removed,dang thats perfect
nba,not_removed,on mobile your flair looked like the south korean flag for a second lol
nba,not_removed,thats a pretty sad realization
nba,not_removed,what about devin harris
nba,not_removed,not really deron in put up better numbers and was a better player than lin has ever shown to be in the nbaoutside of the few weeks of linsanity lin has a lot to prove if he wants to play at that level
nba,not_removed,what makes you think they arent already banging
nba,not_removed,they can get married and brooks name can be brook lin
nba,not_removed,how the fuck are we supposed to compete with a super team
nba,not_removed,what do you have against brooklyn lol
nba,not_removed,hasnt missed a game due to injury since december which was unrelated to his foot hopefully that keeps up
nba,not_removed,imagine if he was on the spurs
nba,not_removed,nets are really wasting his talents
nba,not_removed,he can bop it spin it flick it
nba,not_removed,yea he was throwing shade at omer asik for dropping so many dope ass dimes
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,ayo rockets fan talking about defense
nba,not_removed,hows the bobcats doing these days
nba,not_removed,he hasnt missed games since
nba,not_removed,whats the deal with people thinking lopez is made of glass hes had two injuries in his eightyear career
nba,not_removed,flair up
nba,not_removed,honestly he needs a rebound postchandler
nba,not_removed,i hear he changed his form again charlotte was basically his testing ground for his shot i think hell shoot better in the nets
nba,not_removed,i see a lot of open and midrange in lins future
nba,not_removed,no deng is on the lakers
nba,not_removed,damn can i get that as an option mods
nba,not_removed,sadder realization is that brook is in his ninth season now and kenny atkinson is the ninth different coach that hes played for lawrence frank tom barrise kiki vandeweghe avery johnson pj carlesimo jason kidd lionel hollins tony brown barrise coached only two games it was after frank was fired and before vandeweghe was named the official interim barrises twogame tenure as hc still counts as a different hc though
nba,not_removed,not that sad that particular deron williams was arguably the best point guard in the league over that period averaged something like and on the best ts of any volume scorer other than steph curry
nba,not_removed,another sad realization best pg melos played with for an entire season in ny is in shape felton knicks management has totally failed him in that respect considering solid pg play puts his game on an entirely different level
nba,not_removed,hmm thats true harris allstar season was brooks rookie year it feels like such a different era though like it doesnt feel like brook started alongside the backcourt of devin harris and vince carter but he did crazy that this is brooks ninth consecutive season as a net i cant remember the last net that was on the team for that long
nba,not_removed,i would argue jarrett jack too
nba,not_removed,brook barely played that season and i mean williams averaged and that year nothing crazy id be very disappointed if lins stats are worse than that this season
nba,not_removed,a comic book nerd and a christian its gonna take a while to go for it
nba,not_removed,jeremy lopez j lo
nba,not_removed,lolll
nba,not_removed,because you also have a super team
nba,not_removed,knicks fans and nets fans dont always get alongtwo teams in the same city causes some tension between fans
nba,not_removed,seriously what the fuckmaybe i dont know what im talking about here lol all i know is i was surprised with him every time ive seen him play recently because of how little exposure he gets
nba,not_removed,honestly ive liked him since college as a player i wouldnt mind seeing him on the team especially if he performed even better with a team around him however i think we really got our main pieces and i doubt nets are giving him up cheap
nba,not_removed,fuck asik and his shitty ass hands
nba,not_removed,jesus fuck i remember watching those houston games and i thought shit omers pts and lins assists would be so much higher if asik could just catch the fucking ball in the paint i think his hands cost the team at least points of conversion per game
nba,not_removed,says the suns fan
nba,not_removed,feet under
nba,not_removed,yeah youre right its just that he played and games in year and people just remember bad things more vividly i guess
nba,not_removed,because he missed nearly a full season with each of those injuries i dont have anything against the guy hope he stays healthy doesnt mean he will
nba,not_removed,he did get a rebound with dwight hopefully lin works better with brook
nba,not_removed,i dont think brook can provide any rebounding
nba,not_removed,my goodness i still am recovering from the awfulness that was lionel hollins heck i even liked the hire at first but its clear his old school mentality made the nets worse
nba,not_removed,dude is what jahlil okafor is gonna be
nba,not_removed,correct people just dont remember how smooth he was
nba,not_removed,unfortunately he only played two half seasons with the nets
nba,not_removed,for us guys who do remember damn he dropped off pretty fast from being head to head with to now
nba,not_removed,and id respectfully ask you what kind of drugs youre on and to please pass them
nba,not_removed,per possessions that season dwill put up and on true shooting lin to this point does not have a better season on record outside of the small sample with the knicks im expecting a leap from lin but i think people might be crowning him before he actually proves anything i could probably make a case that lins best full season is pretty much on par with derons worse which was the season with the nets
nba,not_removed,lopez so you read any comic books lin uhim a christian
nba,not_removed,a comic book nerd and anyone really
nba,not_removed,if sheltered church girls are incredibly slutty christianity isnt that much of a hurdle to clear
nba,not_removed,lin is a huge lol edit dota and naruto fan guy is plenty nerdy
nba,not_removed,i agree with you there
nba,not_removed,youd think hed know that lol
nba,not_removed,i feel like theres usually some history or reason for one to be jealous of or look down on the other the knicks and nets dont have that theyre just both fuckups with crazy owners
nba,not_removed,its not your fault its an extremely common misconception that lopez is a soft injury prone bad defender which is simply not true he will only get the respect he deserves when the nets are relevant againthe one time he was an allstar wasnt necessarily his best year just the nets best year
nba,not_removed,its understandable lol since hes a bigman who had a foot injury and since the nets arent a popular team to watch and follow he played every single game of his first three seasons then he broke his foot two times in three seasons but hes been fine since the second break
nba,not_removed,i think lopez would be a better fit on your team than aldridge elite low post threat kawhi with the iso spacing and some point snipers to add to the spacing mixed with spurs team system would be deadly
nba,not_removed,at least
nba,not_removed,well yeah what i meant is that those two injuries were it people act like hes missing games every season he hasnt missed a game due to injury in almost two calendar years
nba,not_removed,damn i forgot lin played for the lakers for a season
nba,not_removed,dwight left the lakers the offseason the lin came over
nba,not_removed,he was apparently a major piece of shit ownership hated him and couldnt forgive billy king for hiring him if thats the one thing that ownership couldnt let go over everything else that king did then you know it mustve been really bad
nba,not_removed,a lot of people were high on the hollins hire i was shocked memphis had let him go originally looking back well damn
nba,not_removed,some of the best size up moves to ever grace the point guard position
nba,not_removed,i think its because he had that brandon royjames harden slow mo looking style i also remember how he would get insanely hot from some games
nba,not_removed,you know he doesnt pass
nba,not_removed,dota
nba,not_removed,i personally have no idea what thats like
nba,not_removed,i live in brooklyn and i never knew there was some sort of feud between fans of the nets and knicks granted i dont go around asking people how they feel about both things its still a bit of a foreign idea to me the nets or so insignificant compared to the knicks i didnt really think there would be a problem thats not an insult to the nets either im just saying that knicks compared to nets are a few tiers higher franchise wise and dominance wise
nba,not_removed,this is way back but the knicks were the ones who forced the nets to sell dr j they wanted the nets to pay them when the nets joined the nba since they were invading the market and in order to afford that the nets needed to sell dr j funny thing is that they offered to give him to the knicks as payment but the knicks said no but yeah other than that the knicks and nets have never been good at the same time they played one another in the playoffs that one year but the nets swept without much trouble both teams were good in though i remember those games were tense as shit especially that mlk day matinee game
nba,not_removed,were just fighting to see who can be the better fuck up
nba,not_removed,its proximitysame city i dont see it as a heated rivalry more like siblings having to share a bedroom or something nets are stylish and new knicks are classic and established conversely the nets are brandingoverbasketball and unestablished invaders from new jersey and the knicks are longtermunsuccessful and yesterdays news or the like i think its funone day in my lifetime i imagine both teams will be in an eastern conference final together and thatll be so much fun in this city i mean not soon of course but someday
nba,not_removed,people will realize this season when the nets are fighting for that last playoff spot
nba,not_removed,yeah i agree hes more of the traditional spurs team layout but honestly whynotbothjpg and just have him play center lol obviously the fit we got right now is working fairly well
nba,not_removed,incorrect
nba,not_removed,you mean the pre crossover drive moves if so i completely agree and i notice kyrie has perhaps the best size up moves in this day and age
nba,not_removed,i love how smooth he makes those hesitation sizeup moves look
nba,not_removed,you people will never understand
nba,not_removed,dominance wise you realize the nets have been to the playoffs and won more playoff games than the knicks have in the past decade right
nba,not_removed,they were pretty competitive a couple years ago and it was a fun rivalry
nba,not_removed,the nets look forward to playing the sixers in the first round
nba,not_removed,thanks fam
nba,not_removed,i want the spurs to do well i would love to see them in the finals over gsw tbh even tho with gsw there would be a lot more hype and expectations but i just dont see aldridge being the guy to take them to the promise land his slight inefficiencyinconsistency would be costly also the spurs interior defense post duncan with pau and aldridge is going to be interestingly different
nba,not_removed,i was wrong i was wrong because lin joined the lakers for the season dwight played for them for the season so there was actually a full season between there tenures with the team look it up just like i did
nba,not_removed,yup had a great understanding of gradual tempo between moves which made the hesitationinsideoutscrossovers incredibly unpredictable
nba,not_removed,really aldridge is one of the best posts in the league right now and this last postseason he was godmode guy averaged like points over the first two games and then only dropped after that i have very few reservations about him being a great asset personally the only problems ive had with him on the team is we seem to have adopted a much more typical plan on offense settling for basketball between kawhi and aldridge i think the best we ever played was the seasons where we had the best ball movement ive ever seen if we can get a little more back to that while still having the amazing talent we have it will be great as far as interior defense i am also a little questioning since weve historically had such amazing defense just by having tim down there well see where they lead us but i think they are very spursy acquisitions for what was available
nba,not_removed,right but what you missed was dwight and lin played together in houston in that inbetween season
nba,not_removed,oh man right you are shit i look foolish i do recall him having a brief bromance with nick young during his lakers season
nba,not_removed,but parsons was also on that team and lin and dwight never really had a thing together so idk what this whole thread is about
nba,not_removed,like amare but with defense
nba,not_removed,like amare with defense but without the ability to be a first option on offense so basically the opposite of amare
nba,not_removed,the comparison is about signing a former all star older injury riddled big for way too much not playstyle
nba,not_removed,what was that thing timmy did on the last play it looked like his feet were off of the ground it was very strange
nba,not_removed,i kinda forgot how quick timmy was
nba,not_removed,what a ridiculous front court that was
nba,not_removed,d rob has the physique of myths
nba,not_removed,now i really want to see what david vs tim would be like in an actual game blasphemy i know
nba,not_removed,twitter video to streamable bot not affiliated with previous bot streamable link pm this account for questionscommentsconcerns
nba,not_removed,you can see how the admiral influenced tims style of play
nba,not_removed,ref could be doing his job instead of celebrating that last timmy block
nba,not_removed,be still my beating heart
nba,not_removed,damn timmys reaction after blocking david he was really going for it eh
nba,not_removed,jesus robinsons body was carved from stone dude was maybe the most athletic looking player ever
nba,not_removed,easy to see where the big fundamentals name came from not that i didnt know but its clearly on display here
nba,not_removed,i love the white dude clapping after one of tims basket like he was remotely involved in that play
nba,not_removed,saw timmy use his left hand more there than in his entire career
nba,not_removed,noclip
nba,not_removed,thats illegal right im pretty sure a player cant just hover above the ground like that
nba,not_removed,no wonder he was a in nba live back in the day
nba,not_removed,many people forget how damn good he was thats why when people talk about his prime as not being that strong but he has the longevity people really didnt watch him or forgot
nba,not_removed,preinjury duncan was super athletic
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,its just unfortunate that health kind of took away drob end of career i wish their careers aligned a bit more
nba,not_removed,godly physique
nba,not_removed,id be so conflicted i wouldnt know what to do with my hands during that game
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,yup goin against david every practice must have really made him work
nba,not_removed,between the military and being a pro athlete fat never had a chance
nba,not_removed,its not a travel if you dont touch the ground
nba,not_removed,i hate it when people on here try to say that kgs peak was better no question than duncans prime duncan was every bit the player that prime kg was and in a lot of ways he was better its definitely more of an argument than people say
nba,not_removed,tbf if health hadnt eroded the admiral we would never have had timmy in the first place
nba,not_removed,same thing you do every other night while watching videos of two huge black men go at it
nba,not_removed,im its not even an argument timmy was better in his prime
nba,not_removed,is that true though i thought the admiral passed the torch like after day
nba,not_removed,haha youd know all about that i suspect after all is that not why we are here
nba,not_removed,he did but i was referring to his back injury in that allowed us to tank for duncan in the first place he had a few good years after that but he was never the same as he was in his prime it kind of gets forgotten but drob was a fucking force in the
nba,not_removed,ah gotcha that makes sense
nba,not_removed,smh at chuck citing jerryd bayless presence as a reason theyve improved twice come on man you pretend to watch the sixers hes played games all year
nba,not_removed,why are we surprised shaq is legacy obsessed he doesnt like dominant young bigs especially those who get compared to him and deserve it dwight first and now its embiid
nba,not_removed,how long has it been since shaq said something insightful on that show i dont watch as much as i used to but every time i do tune in shaq basically just sits silently for straight minutes then says something basic in that mumbled monotone its not like he dumb or bad at speaking he just doesnt act like himself on that show he was always so charismatic and interesting in interviews during his playing days but now hes like a statue on the show
nba,not_removed,shaq obviously wanted them to point out he wasnt giving them credit and get in an argument but thankfully everyone ignored him for the most part
nba,not_removed,i can understand skepticism but i dont see how you cant at least be a little impressed
nba,not_removed,i have no problem with people who doubt the thats what being a fan is it wouldnt be fun if everyone bought in what i do have a problem with is dumb arguments and shaq constantly makes dumb arguments when discussing phillyembiid this idea that hes not impressed with embiid and but he is ready to blow boogies caaaack about being the most impressive big in the league the kings record is virtually the same ish basically i just want to know why shaq dislikes the process so much with a decent argument instead of just looking like a salty retired dude who is threatened by a personable big
nba,not_removed,i dont see the problem with this so long as there are doubters itll only add fuel to the sixers fire to prove them wrong
nba,not_removed,chuck asks shaq whose future hed rather have and shaq mumbles i dont care about future i care about right now bruh the sixers and heat are tied at games back that dont make any sense
nba,not_removed,the thing i love most is how chuck always specifies he is as impressed with simmons as he is embiid if he is anywhere near his talent level and they compliment each other lookout
nba,not_removed,the big goof
nba,not_removed,shaq is a fat fuck
nba,not_removed,hes such a fucking insecure baby you can see it in his face when his ego takes a hit and hes salty face gets all scrunched up gets all petty and condescending textbook insecurity
nba,not_removed,shaq also never mentioned embiid in that vid they just asked him if he thought them being was impressive and he emphatically said no thats a losing ass record why would he be impressed because they actually built a team this year you guys seriously exposing yourself as embiid fans
nba,not_removed,shaq ohhhh right that guy on tv
nba,not_removed,can you have a me against the world attitude if you cheered for your team to be as shitty as possible the past couple of years how does that work fuckin lol hating on shaq but he didnt wish anything like that on your team hypocritical fucks
nba,not_removed,kennys dumbass hot take about effort was so much more egregiously wrong as long as chuck keeps backin ben and embiid to these fools and his point about losing winnable games showed me that he actually did watch some sixers games when i would have sworn hes watched none then i can forgive him for thinking bayless has done jack shit this year
nba,not_removed,he does seem to judge other centers more harshly than the rest of the positions but who can blame him setting aside his whole career legacywhen he looks at young bigs im sure hes thinking of his own rookie season which was both more spectacular and made a bigger difference on his teams winloss record than any rookie since he wasnt just eyeopening he was a gamechanger right from the start still in terms of record change shaq had nothing on birds rookie seasonfrom to wins†or david to wins which is why its hard to properly judge tim duncans rookie season in terms of winloss impact their big turnaround was also due to robinson coming back from a year lost to injury †although of course a different rookiewho remains the only rookie to win finals mvpwould lead his team to the title that year
nba,not_removed,while i dont like shaq on tv it must be extremely annoying to know whats coming imagine next years people will ask him everyday how about that embiid guy what do you think about him he is pretty good isnt he is he more dominant than you i know it would piss me off and im not even a former player
nba,not_removed,its been a while such a funny charismatic guy has kind of turned into a dude who cant take a joke and lacks anything interesting or insightful to contribute
nba,not_removed,its not like hes dumb or bad at speaking well he doesnt act like himself on that show double well
nba,not_removed,not obvious and quite frankly none of that happened
nba,not_removed,shaq has an ownership stake in the kings so has good reason to hype up boogie other than that hes a sensitive big goofy bitch
nba,not_removed,the same reason he always hated dwight a new fresh big with a big personality hes an insecure baby who cant stand the thought that someone might take some of the limelight off him as the big funny guy
nba,not_removed,im not gonna pretend to say shaqs not funny cause he is more often than not in my opinion his main problem is not being able to take jokes and hating on someone for no reason
nba,not_removed,textbook insecurity
nba,not_removed,that pissed me off so much anyone that has watched this team the last couple years knows that they gave incredible effort with the exception of a few games
nba,not_removed,lol you couldnt just say something good about the celtics and leave it huh but yes i agree that he judges harshly on centers too but i think it is because of what he had to do against other behemoths in the post in his era i also have no doubt in my mind that if teams would have modern defense against him he would rack up assists he was such a fantastic passer out of the post
nba,not_removed,midlife crisis
nba,not_removed,my buddys mom used to be a smoke show and bagged a doctor in large part because of it now she drinks a lot of white wine and feels the need to pick apart any lady who resembles the way she views her prior self shaqs attempts to prop himself up are as hollow and fragile as those of a menopausal alcoholic trophy wife
nba,not_removed,he has to steal the souls of young centers to survive
nba,not_removed,i never got pissed off before at dudes coming at the process because i can respect an opinion about tanking or whatever that i disagree with but only a fucking moron or liar would say the sixers of the last years didnt leave every drop of blood and sweat on the court save for a few dark nights he shit directly on brett brown and the incredible job hes done keeping these dudes spirits alive to fight despite a basically impossible talent differential fuck kenny smith
nba,not_removed,i think theres something to be said for the extra confidence more than anything we saw a ton of effort from our guys in previous seasons but they always had their heads down tbh now they are putting in the effort and success seems like a drug to them now
nba,not_removed,thats not midlife crisis hes always been like that midlife crisis is desiring your youth again and doing things to compensate for the fact it will never happen again
nba,not_removed,probably past the midpoint foot people dont tend to live very long
nba,not_removed,what about foot guys with million or whatever he has that live in and beyond where medical technology is advancing at an insane rate
nba,not_removed,its not crazy to think he could live to with that income hell did you hear they put a pig heart in a man do you know that means
nba,not_removed,chesapeake and mcclendon are so fucking shady well i guess i should say was for mcclendon
nba,not_removed,so if an nba owner can no longer hold onto a franchise what happens nba buys it up till they can sell it to someone can a new buyer move the team or could the team be moved idk
nba,not_removed,hes in deep shade right now
nba,not_removed,well the mcclendon family owns only of the thunder and yeah if they go bankrupt then they put their stake up for sale anyone can make an offer including the nba and then they find a new buyer its what happened to the thenhornets larry ellison made an offer and wanted to move the team to san jose but then the nba swooped in most likely because they wanted to keep the team in new orleans
nba,not_removed,the team will never be moved to seattle especially since they dont even have a fucking arena
nba,not_removed,ha its not hurt im just legitimately curious what would happen
nba,not_removed,like father like son
nba,not_removed,doc is setting a bad example for his team
nba,not_removed,it was a controversial call though by the official that got hit because on screen it just looked like austin playfully patted him bottom line refs suck
nba,not_removed,like son like father
nba,not_removed,he probably shouldnt have come back in after taking that wrap off
nba,not_removed,crabbe and moe played him extremely well
nba,not_removed,none of the rockets did really they had plenty of chances to tie it or go ahead just bricked em
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i hope one game doesnt swing the vote though my personal vote has been for wb but you cant discount harden because of one game
nba,not_removed,harden needs to rest im not saying this because i want russ to win mvpi do but at this point its clear all harden is playing for is the mvp and it could hurt them in the playoffs just watch the video he takes literally every shot for his team and bricks most of them
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,he literally threw the ball out of bounds with like minutes left
nba,not_removed,he really doesnt want to sit but his wrist is really effecting his ball him sitting will see the rockets get blown out and they havent clinched the seed yet tough position for he and his teampringles im sure if russ werent playing out of his mind he wouldve been able to take a game or two off recency bias is going to be a motherfucker with some of the voters who dont take their vote as seriously
nba,not_removed,westbrook is playing out of his mind while harden is having trouble russ might just snatch the mvp
nba,not_removed,cause of the efficiency harden puts up with his foul drawing it seems to generally go unnoticed that he shoots as many contested pull up threes as westbrook and is not much more accurate
nba,not_removed,that steal crabbe got with his ears alone was great
nba,not_removed,he looks like he plays for the cavs
nba,not_removed,bad wrist though
nba,not_removed,fair or not this injury is gonna lose mvp for harden he obviously wants it very bad and his team needs him but staying out there could really fuck him up come playoff time
nba,not_removed,welp lil b curse caught up to him yomp
nba,not_removed,fantasy owners hate him i cri evrytime
nba,not_removed,my man helping out his old teammate friend and fashionbuddy
nba,not_removed,he looks like a man who could use a few days rest
nba,not_removed,yomp
nba,not_removed,shot them out of the game cant blame him for trying though cant be the star player and play scared ever
nba,not_removed,i love how on the layup attemptstrip he does his classic arms up flail instead of getting back on defence
nba,not_removed,mvp
nba,not_removed,he wanted to do what wb did so badly
nba,not_removed,cant be a stick shift with no clutch
nba,not_removed,that title sounds like it could be posted on rnosleep
nba,not_removed,against us he just fucking shat on our souls god dang it harden
nba,not_removed,lillard got pushed in the back on that first shot
nba,not_removed,live by the die by the
nba,not_removed,theres a guy that brought his team back to win a game in the final minutes
nba,not_removed,this is definitely the brightest timeline
nba,not_removed,holding onto his mvp aspirations holding onto his mvp aspirations and down
nba,not_removed,but hes the three seed everyone expected rockets to finish seed mvp
nba,not_removed,why arent there criteria for mvp voting and all the other voting its so stupid
nba,not_removed,bestbrook for mvp
nba,not_removed,omfg what a god awful performance clearly out of the running for mvp wowowow s
nba,not_removed,thats what she said
nba,not_removed,he did hit his first shot after that though announcers made a huge deal about it
nba,not_removed,crabbe got two fouls and then shot lights out
nba,not_removed,story of half our games for a while now
nba,not_removed,asking for someone to animate harden into a human torch
nba,not_removed,triggered
nba,not_removed,seconded also hoping for westbrook barring a great kawhi streak but harden has been fantastic all season and honestly all the mvp candidates have had off games even off weeks at times
nba,not_removed,he wont be voting is far away the entire season will be considered
nba,not_removed,media is dying to pick someone though theyve struggled with the decision for months and you cant deny the power of a narrative especially at the end of the season
nba,not_removed,true but if his wrist is this bad ideally he should sit and heal up for playoffs but that probably would cost him the mvp so harden wouldnt agree to it
nba,not_removed,ahem let me tell you about this guy named john starks
nba,not_removed,actually i think you can and it probably will the top vote getters are going to be so close that the swing voters will almost certainly let recency bias creep in
nba,not_removed,he was pretty bad against the warriors on tuesday too
nba,not_removed,yep hes definitely playing for mvp and its unfortunate his wrist needs rest before the playoffs i would sit him in oakland
nba,not_removed,hes gonna make it to the playoffs banged up and bruised they need a polishedrested harden to make some noise i literally think they have a chance at competing for the chip but harden seems to only care for mvp and it showed big time last night and didnt pan out so well i hope his wrist heals and playing mins a game wont help it
nba,not_removed,lol what are you doing man i hope they play harden every single game with max minutes in hope of getting mvp which he probably will its almost certain we are getting rockets vs thunder in the playoffs a banged up harden equals advantage okc
nba,not_removed,its affect
nba,not_removed,why in the world would harden sitting automatically result in the rockets getting blow out by rip city the rockets are damn good
nba,not_removed,tomorrow nights game is huge for the mvp race national tv game vs an elite team really the last notable matchup of the season for the thunder if westbrook goes crazy and gets a win hes for sure the frontrunner
nba,not_removed,hes having trouble a fg with ppg rpg apg in the last ten
nba,not_removed,its going to be hard to get votes on a seed
nba,not_removed,harden is not having trouble lmfao his wrist is not even so you really cant fault him
nba,not_removed,okc is in march so clutch much russ
nba,not_removed,westbrook shots less free throws per game hes more efficient because he has better shooting percentages in general
nba,not_removed,shit like this annoys me blazers fans went through it for most of january your star decides to play through injury which hurts his numbers and fans on rnba dont care about the fact hes playing hurt they just look at his box score the fact that hardens toughing it out for his team through injury should be applauded even if his stats struggle a bit shame it ends up hurting him in the public eye
nba,not_removed,you can only run for so long
nba,not_removed,you said this twice fam
nba,not_removed,yup thats that kobe and jordan mentality its great to see the best players play like that even when they dont win too many stars dont have that same mentality anymore and maybe im just an old head but thats what i like damnit lol
nba,not_removed,does harden want to be a stick shift why
nba,not_removed,holy overreaction
nba,not_removed,i know right what do something good games have on a few bad games westbrook and kawhi are literally and have this mvp on lockdown
nba,not_removed,good ol rnba
nba,not_removed,your insecurities do all the talking necessary to know westbrook doesnt have this locked up like the rest of rnba would like to make you think
nba,not_removed,cmon mate
nba,not_removed,dodgeball
nba,not_removed,ayyy lmao
nba,not_removed,httpiimgurcomponangif
nba,not_removed,you guys have won of your last
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,people are gonna argue on how harden has beaten westbrook in all encounters
nba,not_removed,who the fuck said that
nba,not_removed,so youre telling me averaging fg over the entire last two minutes isnt bad
nba,not_removed,lets be completely fair tho they are both playing for mvp now its a very close race and both of them want to win it and i welcome it let the best man win
nba,not_removed,i firmly believe a team that plays defense that terribly and relies so much on shooting has no chance at winning a championship
nba,not_removed,ehh rockets have too many offensive weapons imo theyve played the thunder really well in the regular season the thunder dont really have much of an advantage
nba,not_removed,i dunno if anyone is beating the warriors its a ridiculously hot shooting streak from the rockets in imo
nba,not_removed,i mean im sure he wants it but id hope hed want to be ready for the playoffs even if he believes he cant win
nba,not_removed,i just dont get how people think this team would be good without harden the players we have fit great around harden but take him out and they arent winning games portlands best player would be our best player if we got rid of james
nba,not_removed,notsureifsrs
nba,not_removed,lol ofc its a thunder fan saying this bro have you seen us play without harden besides the occasional drive by gordon someone would just jack up a contested rockets are not a damn good team wo harden maybe theyre a bit better than the thunder but you guys seriously are ridiculous with all this russ is draggin along total garbage just so he can have mvp neither of our teams are great shitting on your own team is absolutely the worst way to have your player win mvp its downright disrespectful
nba,not_removed,just in these last games hes been a lil off
nba,not_removed,watch the actual games he had a triple double against the warriors but didnt really play well
nba,not_removed,in their last games
nba,not_removed,but other than free throws hes not all that efffecient
nba,not_removed,your username and flair is confusing me
nba,not_removed,the fact that hardens toughing it out for his team through injury should be applauded true but only if it helps his team if his injury is bad enough that it hurts his production enough to hurt the team then hes better off sitting and recuperating right especially since the rockets are pretty close to locked into the seed in the west
nba,not_removed,but if you know youre playing poorly due to an injury wouldnt you defer to your teammates in the clutch
nba,not_removed,hmm but to me i still feel like harden is much better taking rest now because it seems like at this rate its gonna affect their playoff run which is arguably way more important not sure if the mvp pressure is getting to him or not
nba,not_removed,hes playing through it for mvp not for his team
nba,not_removed,from the dmv driving a car with a manual transmission—also called a stick shift—requires more skill and understanding than operating a vehicle with an automatic transmission in a stick shift vehicle you will be manually shifting gears to adjust your speed rather than letting the car do it for you
nba,not_removed,because everyone hates him
nba,not_removed,tis rnba
nba,not_removed,yeah it just feels like weve been on and off since january
nba,not_removed,now make a shooting stars video
nba,not_removed,my god this is great
nba,not_removed,no i think the problem is the mvp vote has become partisan people have locked onto one candidate and arent going to shift gears no matter what the other candidates does people dont want to be convinced they just want to be right so the people supporting wb are going to keep supporting wb even if he falls off a cliff to close the season and the people supporting harden are going to do the same its just how it is
nba,not_removed,except we took one game at home
nba,not_removed,nobody
nba,not_removed,what the fuck are u talking about
nba,not_removed,being completely honest though a russ mvp is all the thunder can reasonably hope for rockets are outside title contenders imo
nba,not_removed,russ is also playing for the fourth seed harden isnt moving up or down at this point in the standings
nba,not_removed,yes i agree hence why i believe an injured harden would help okc harden healthy and the rockets is clear over match for okc
nba,not_removed,hey just trying to help bruh
nba,not_removed,were a team or maybe even worse without james imo
nba,not_removed,rockets have a positive net rating when harden sits my friend
nba,not_removed,these last games after he landed on his wrist and has it wrapped up
nba,not_removed,thats such a small sample size though hes looked off in those three games but that shouldnt define his season even with russ having three monster games in a row
nba,not_removed,the last three games after he injured his hand
nba,not_removed,the seven games before that seemed fine though
nba,not_removed,well one of you is clearly wrong they cant be in march and in their last games
nba,not_removed,downvoted for the truth lol this fucking sub
nba,not_removed,other then the part of the game that makes harden efficient hes not efficient k
nba,not_removed,basically im a lifelong blazers fan that also supports the pacers is the short story
nba,not_removed,everyone loves lillard
nba,not_removed,i mean if harden wasnt out there tonight im pretty sure we wouldve won by he may have had a bad last few minutes but where else is his production coming from he still has an mvp impact on his team even with an injury
nba,not_removed,not the best game but he was our main scorer first half
nba,not_removed,fuckin spot on he has an amazing supporting cast especially for clutch comebacks more than a few knock down shooters he tried to prove a point tonight and failed not saying russ hasnt done the same this season but russ doesnt have shooters around him
nba,not_removed,terrible decision making i agree maybe i have no sympathy here for the injury but if youre gonna play then play thats what james said and you have to be smarter about what youre going to do if your wrist is working dont chuck up three bad at the end of a game
nba,not_removed,i dont mean to kiss hardens ass and assign him no wrongdoing im really just frustrated with all the comments along the lines of i thought he was the mvp and other nonsense in recent threads like harden is suddenly trash or something lol the guy is doing all he can
nba,not_removed,if hes doing more harm than good out there then yeah he should sit hard to say whether its come to that point though and you know harden wont be the one to say it even if it were true mdas gonna have to make that call
nba,not_removed,your username makes me sad
nba,not_removed,look at the film nobody else was hitting shit either
nba,not_removed,man that is a labored metaphor nice try though
nba,not_removed,since the new year not the best but far from bad
nba,not_removed,this is the real request
nba,not_removed,my masking got messed up so its a bit shit video editing isnt my forte
nba,not_removed,i hate that but i agree i think there are voters who decided on their mvp pick a while ago and wont switch unless their choice falls off an absolute cliff
nba,not_removed,thats a pretty good theory but that absolutely sucks if true
nba,not_removed,which is a game harden was playing really badly in as well right
nba,not_removed,i highly doubt anyone even on this sub would say something so retarded
nba,not_removed,im mocking how thunder fans always say averaging a triple double over the entire season isnt good apparently people did no get that though
nba,not_removed,im saying even with harden only playing to rockets are still better than the thunder and would win a seven game series
nba,not_removed,a team that relied heavily on lou williams was amongst the worst in the league this season eric gordon cant consistently great for himself and others ryno would thrive off the open looks he gets from his superstar teammates bev is great but cant be relied on as the primary playmaker for more than mins at a time and would break down tryna be a major player on both ends of the court we already have seen what happen when ariza is one of the primary offensive options on a team this team is very clearly currently built around harden so that it maximizes the player stats and harden stats strength and it is also very clearly built to entice another star player as there is no clear cut second option and no one who can take the role of the primary ball handler and playmaker when hardens not in so they know that when they come here they wont need to really worry about getting touches since theres no one outside of harden whos really a reliable go to offensive option every single night
nba,not_removed,one could argue thats because harden only sits when the other teams bench players are in resulting in a bench v bench i have no idea if thats right at all i dont watch any rockets games but one could argue that
nba,not_removed,a net positiveof the differential when harden plays versus doesnt is far greater than wbs
nba,not_removed,i know and agree
nba,not_removed,agree
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i mean thats what i said i didnt say harden wasnt efficienct but if it wasnt for the crazy amount of free throws he takes he wouldnt be efficient
nba,not_removed,lillard is the truth
nba,not_removed,not all star game voters
nba,not_removed,from three
nba,not_removed,he has shooters around him who
nba,not_removed,none of his teammates were hitting shit last night down the stretch
nba,not_removed,lmao thunder fans always tryna pull the harden has better teammates shit out
nba,not_removed,i like to think you alternate between this and with blazer flair
nba,not_removed,thank you my dude
nba,not_removed,thanks for the perspective bud
nba,not_removed,i mean i just look at averages they play a full season they can have bad games sure but the averages put that all together
nba,not_removed,it would be interesting if voters couldnt watch any games until the season was over then they could look at stats and the best and worst games for the mvp candidates
nba,not_removed,see us presidential race
nba,not_removed,westbrook played amazing in game of their season matchup but they still lost bc its a team game westbrook outplayed harden that game too but their team absolutely outplayed our team that one game which is why i personally dont base my opinion on team success but i know why people do i get it i just base my opinion differently
nba,not_removed,lol we are just making fun of the post earlier in the season where a guy literally made a post that said why are we acting like points is good i dont remember the actual post or number but it was over we dont just say that shit just to say it lol its just a meme making fun of that guy
nba,not_removed,yes yes i agree
nba,not_removed,winner
nba,not_removed,half
nba,not_removed,joe
nba,not_removed,looks around nervously
nba,not_removed,yeah i agree we just feel off since that one losing streak even though we had a pretty good march with the exception of that one okc game i cant remember the last time i thought we played really good lakers perhaps
nba,not_removed,god no stats are great for what they are but they never tell the whole story id rather have mvp voters watch lots of basketball and keep notes then when the mvp race heats up they watch every single game by each mvp candidate just one example but remember wilt averaged one season and didnt win mvp many reasons may be but obviously they didnt decide that mvp race based on stats
nba,not_removed,the one thing reddit finally got right
nba,not_removed,id say westbrook played best in game when he dropped in game their stats were tied until garbage time cant ding harden for feeding his teammates when guys like trevor ariza whove been inconsistent af all season were shooting lights out
nba,not_removed,is not are
nba,not_removed,i know lol but yall post that everywhere
nba,not_removed,final score
nba,not_removed,never heard of him wish he couldve knocked down some shots tonight though
nba,not_removed,look at stats and the best and worst games for the mvp candidates my point was mainly that theres a problem with voters deciding early on in the season i didnt say that the stats alone should decide the mvp
nba,not_removed,lol yeah its just a huge meme id say everyone posts it not just us its gotten as big as meme honestly lol
nba,not_removed,the argument was about playing him at all if harden shouldve played fewer minutes or not so much late in the game thats a different story
nba,not_removed,you never heard of joe mama going to go ahead and exit out of here and have a beer have a good night rocketbro
nba,not_removed,thats terrifying good job
nba,not_removed,going to the hornets in

nba,not_removed,looks younger than thon
nba,not_removed,ximo pierto on youtube
nba,not_removed,it doesnt get much better than rnba and dawkins on youtube
nba,not_removed,ximo
nba,not_removed,the nbas youtube channel is fairly decent theres a guy who i have saved on my work laptop who has a dope channel that gives you minutes per game of highlights if he isnt posted by tomorrow ill update my comment when i get to work
nba,not_removed,reddit specifically rnba
nba,not_removed,dawkins
nba,not_removed,hell yea that is awesome i love that they do long full game highlights most other nba highlights youtubers ive seen just do single player highlights
nba,not_removed,where did that channel come from is it sanctioned or is it just some random dude
nba,not_removed,downtobuck too
nba,not_removed,his video descriptions are second to none
nba,not_removed,good thing it didnt matter
nba,not_removed,insert largest shrug emoticon possible
nba,not_removed,im glad we came out with the win even with that
nba,not_removed,hawks in
nba,not_removed,can someone explain hasnt hanging on the rim like that always been a technical and its always that techs ejection
nba,not_removed,what was he ejected for havent really seen anything about why it happened
nba,not_removed,wouldve been so salty if we lost after that
nba,not_removed,he got his second tech for doing a pull upafter a dunk in reality there was a dude standing underneath him and he was waiting for him to move to come down
nba,not_removed,gotcha thanks
nba,not_removed,a lot of people lost money gambling today
nba,not_removed,what you tryna say
nba,not_removed,yeah haha wow how embarrassing for the cavs and the clips i mean jeez that must be humiliating haha everybody look at them
nba,not_removed,we are the best team in the nba how is it an upset
nba,not_removed,the biggest winner was the top team that didnt play tonight
nba,not_removed,we should have played the warriors tonight smh
nba,not_removed,night of the l
nba,not_removed,your username fits my mood right now
nba,not_removed,im so glad we didnt play tonight doesnt look like a good day for top teams
nba,not_removed,detroit missing jackson and drummond picked up a flagrant and had to leave the game in the first half but still blew out charlotte
nba,not_removed,its kind of expected for us taiwanese fans tho theres this basketball column writerreportercolors caster called lys here whats special about him is that almost all of the predictions he made since last years playoffs were wrong basically if he writes an article predicting anything close to being positive about a team you can expect some shit to happen to them vice versa for negative comments he managed to predict all of the heats playoff games wrong and guess what he wrote days ago lakers upandcoming mavs are fucked bulls and knicks look pretty good clippers are gods and the cavs are invincible and i guess this is just the beginning of the prophecies oh and he also wrote an article on nick young saying hows hes revitalized this season last week
nba,not_removed,why didnt you add lakers losing to the pelicans to the title smh
nba,not_removed,detroit upset charlotte pelicans upset lakers and houston about to be upset too every higher seed team losing tonight unless rockets come back
nba,not_removed,magic bucks nets sounds like magical buckets
nba,not_removed,a parlay on the magic nets and bucks games would have won
nba,not_removed,its opposite day in the nba
nba,not_removed,yep i pretty much picked all the wrong games winners in the app zero vc for me
nba,not_removed,three of the leagues top teams the only one that is missing is the warriors warriors blew a lead in the finals
nba,not_removed,to be more specific all teams with worse records coming into tonight won the nba is a strange place sometimes
nba,not_removed,goddamit should have bet on the clipsnets game i saw somewhere
nba,not_removed,dont forget lakers to pelicans
nba,not_removed,sooo uhhh we uhhhh arent the actual contenders were pretenders
nba,not_removed,why couldnt it be us fam
nba,not_removed,we now though
nba,not_removed,warriors are like lol
nba,not_removed,spurs is in opposite land they dont want to win at home
nba,not_removed,lakers also lost to the pelicans
nba,not_removed,teams on the same night check those numbers now fam 😎
nba,not_removed,fucking called it im so smart i totally knew this was going to happen
nba,not_removed,not a coincidence i sacrificed my firstborn to the chaos gods
nba,not_removed,only if the kings nvm wed still lose
nba,not_removed,makes me feel a little better about our loss honestly if only the warriors were in on the action too
nba,not_removed,yall should know by now any time the nets play a good team they either win a close game or get blown out we win few games every year but oddly enough the games we win are against good teams
nba,not_removed,this is why we watch
nba,not_removed,fucking barry allen fucking the time line
nba,not_removed,also not trying to be that guy but looks like the rockets might be joining soon
nba,not_removed,today was not a good day for sports betting lost quite a bit pfft fuck the randomness of the nba endrant
nba,not_removed,now this was totally unexpected
nba,not_removed,its opposite day
nba,not_removed,i literally got zero games right on the pick em tonight
nba,not_removed,how dare you
nba,not_removed,what a time to be alive
nba,not_removed,i suspect docpop lue rigging the mobile pick win to get them sweet sweet vcs
nba,not_removed,tuesday after turkey
nba,not_removed,yeah its really opposite day the lakers lost too
nba,not_removed,not an excuse but just a note but blake sat out for rest tonight
nba,not_removed,good day to have a night off i guess
nba,not_removed,the clippers are now on a game losing streak
nba,not_removed,ill make sure its just you in the crowd doin tricks you never seen and i bet that i can make you believe in bucks and nets and magic so let me drive the lane around you i bet you know what i mean cause you know that i can make you believe in bucks and nets and magic
nba,not_removed,dont try to depreciate us
nba,not_removed,not only did the cavs spurs and clippers lose but in all the games the team with the worse record win
nba,not_removed,holy shit the chaos god can no longer be sated by college football alone
nba,not_removed,it generated more billionaires in the world
nba,not_removed,rigged
nba,not_removed,its not a surprise this is the nba every team has incredibly talented players and last night those three teams played the better game and while i cant speak for the nets or the magic the bucks are no joke these guys have a young talented core and if you fall asleep on them theyll kick the shit out of you
nba,not_removed,were the best team in the world
nba,not_removed,thank goodness opposite day was yesterday
nba,not_removed,houston lost to utah why are they not mentioned
nba,not_removed,you wouldve made grand betting on all
nba,not_removed,welcome to the nba where everything is made up and the points dont matter
nba,not_removed,its not weird its called the bay pray
nba,not_removed,every time i check the scores and see that heavily favorited teams lost all of the other heavily favorited teams seem to lose as well ive started to refer to it as nba opposite day
nba,not_removed,parity
nba,not_removed,bucks are good though
nba,not_removed,dont forget the hornets lost to pistons
nba,not_removed,we know
nba,not_removed,ive maintained upsets are what make the game great seeing a surprise reminds us never to hatch our eggs before counting them
nba,not_removed,yeah the lakers lost to the pelicans as well cant believe it s
nba,not_removed,thank you for the subtle respect
nba,not_removed,a few people probably won big
nba,not_removed,yeah i missed out on vc per win absolutely ragin my rookie point guard is never gonna up his stats with shit predictions like this
nba,not_removed,not me
nba,not_removed,yep was a pretty bad night to start betting again feelsbadman
nba,not_removed,yes
nba,not_removed,not necessarily vegas moves the line so they have a split in betters
nba,not_removed,they trying to act like we aint good pops
nba,not_removed,idk its like they forgot we were really outchea
nba,not_removed,illuminaughty
nba,not_removed,there is a basketball god
nba,not_removed,ummm your flair is victor oldaipo
nba,not_removed,that the east is weak s
nba,not_removed,i dont have anything to say about voat or any other wacky stuff like that i just wanted to clean my comment history have a great day and be excellent
nba,not_removed,damn you guys have lost home games already and were not even games into the season yet
nba,not_removed,bruh we gon be alright fam 😢😢😢
nba,not_removed,my character in got drafted by the bucks we like and lead the east we da best
nba,not_removed,sorry were the best
nba,not_removed,real talk the cavs looked ugly no excuses but the bucks are way better than the other two giannis and jabari are absolutely better than anyone on the nets or magic atm what are the odds you guys can get back this season
nba,not_removed,the hunted became the hunter tonight
nba,not_removed,wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
nba,not_removed,wheeeeee
nba,not_removed,was the year of ls
nba,not_removed,haha yeah man us too casually tries to sit at cool kids table
nba,not_removed,yeah you guys wouldve lost to the washington generals
nba,not_removed,hm dont know about my team at this stage
nba,not_removed,def would have blown a lead tn
nba,not_removed,charlotte was on the back end of a travelling back to back with games in the last days
nba,not_removed,i can just imagine him in that charlotte vs heat series thinking jeremy lins good jeremy lin sucks jeremy lins good
nba,not_removed,the funny thing is that when you get that bad at predictions you start doing weird shit like picking the opposite flipping a coin copying someone else and he still gets it wrong hes got talent
nba,not_removed,aka 毒奶
nba,not_removed,sounds good to me
nba,not_removed,i was do a shitty comment where i predicted all the underdogs was too lazy people woulda had me tagged as nostradamus or some shit like that
nba,not_removed,no dlo p
nba,not_removed,not a huge upset pelicans are games back on la
nba,not_removed,i dont know if its that much of an upset if utah wins though they would only be games behind the rockets if they win tonight
nba,not_removed,idk if pelicans upset lakers tbh
nba,not_removed,how is the pelicans win an upset they have been playing so well the past few games
nba,not_removed,basketball is weird
nba,not_removed,does houston getting beat by the jazz count as an upset tho
nba,not_removed,they should combine forces and become a superteam real talk i wonder how many games they would win
nba,not_removed,im gonna tell myself that when i get given a time machine
nba,not_removed,dia de opuesta
nba,not_removed,i had a feeling the bucks and nets were gonna beat the cavs and clips not the magic beating the spurs tho how the fuck that happened
nba,not_removed,fuck i gave up already
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i feel dirty upvoting a lakers fan
nba,not_removed,just fck my sht up fam
nba,not_removed,warriors blew a lead thon maker is bucks cavs ecf confirmed
nba,not_removed,didnt watch the game but do the spurs often have trouble with big frontcourts that are fairly good offensively just asking because of okc in the playoffs last year being so effective with kanter against you guys
nba,not_removed,wwlwlllarriors are like lol ftfy
nba,not_removed,we eighth seed 😎
nba,not_removed,i wouldnt mess with the chaos gods like that once you start making offers to them you cant stop or else theyll seek revenge
nba,not_removed,wouldnt this have been a good day for it
nba,not_removed,and i heard paul pierce died
nba,not_removed,ayesha that you
nba,not_removed,giannis is a beast
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,not nearly as large of an upset
nba,not_removed,illuminaughty
nba,not_removed,god could you imagine if you parlayed for every favored team to lose
nba,not_removed,no no just lost 😔
nba,not_removed,i got every single pick wrong my pf can barely make it up and down the court for a few minutes at a time papa needs his vc
nba,not_removed,hold mah back hold mah back dam it
nba,not_removed,the mavs werent mentioned
nba,not_removed,illuminotinmyhouse
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,the struggle is real
nba,not_removed,undefeated on the road tho 💪
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,we da best major key alert
nba,not_removed,so did my character i had two quadruple doubles so far
nba,not_removed,but if you werent the first pick and end up on the sixers you didnt do it right perfect career starts with being top of the draft
nba,not_removed,there is a chance we finish or its really hard to tell the bucks tend to play down or up to their competition i wouldnt be surprised if we drop the game against the nets thursday
nba,not_removed,no the for real top
nba,not_removed,i mean it even featured super bowl l
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,hold this delayed l
nba,not_removed,hey who is that
nba,not_removed,get the fuck back to the lil kids table
nba,not_removed,a terrible day for our standings we just moved down two spots
nba,not_removed,high energy night tonight
nba,not_removed,i thought they were due
nba,not_removed,yeah and hopefully were on the back end of missing all our best players
nba,not_removed,it was a joke shouldve added the s
nba,not_removed,jazz are the spooky team du jour now that the clips have hit a rut theyve won their last games by an average of points and their record would be much better if not for injuries
nba,not_removed,yeah but we still the best team in the league tho right
nba,not_removed,it wouldve been a bona fide upset if russell was playing and swag didnt get injured
nba,not_removed,pelicans had a worse record going into the game its still an upset
nba,not_removed,record wise it does
nba,not_removed,without favors yea
nba,not_removed,lin fournier giannis ibaka lopez conservatively id put them at wins on the east
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,who doesnt
nba,not_removed,you tried
nba,not_removed,we just have defensive issues period wingstop can only do so much
nba,not_removed,we have trouble with athletic frontcourts normally dedmon is great for them now but since weve gone to switch everything mode we miscommunicate a lot and that ends up in easy dunks lay ups etc
nba,not_removed,ibaka is our poison you have to give credit where credit is due orlando played a hell of a game they deserved the win
nba,not_removed,spurs generally have problems with athletic frontcourts dedmon was a great pickup to nullify the issues our defence though has clearly fallen off without timmy anchoring it and pautonys defensive problems
nba,not_removed,lwwwwlwwwwwwwwwwwwarriors are like lol ftfy
nba,not_removed,he ded
nba,not_removed,there was a ufc last year where every single underdog won some guy on rmma posted his parlay ticket where he picked every underdog and bet like he won about edit jesus i was wrong he
nba,not_removed,on the three teams mentioned would win you
nba,not_removed,almost
nba,not_removed,woulda been
nba,not_removed,if it makes you feel better before last night i had every pick right and gave me the false confidence to start real life gambling told my mates at the pub id staring betting on the nbanot common in scotland if i was right again with the results on the appnever been a more clearer sign
nba,not_removed,calm down doc
nba,not_removed,when ur team is ass u now root for the monolith of ass teams
nba,not_removed,its almost like im mocking people that say the east is weak after in the west just lost to in the east
nba,not_removed,i imagine he crashes on the conepost and die
nba,not_removed,idk why this gif is so relevant but it is
nba,not_removed,i dont get why people fight inanimate objects its your fault for getting hurt by the object
nba,not_removed,alert alert alert alert alert alert
nba,not_removed,bitch all i do is win
nba,not_removed,damn because it was my first game i ended up with a sharpshooter pg which is great but i kind of wish i had made something a bit bigger
nba,not_removed,was my first game and i sucked in college and through my first games lol
nba,not_removed,yeah heres to hoping yall stay in it bucks are a tough out for anyone giannis is a fucking monster like at this point you live with his turnovers but if he gets that completely under control and parker develops as he seems to be holy shit
nba,not_removed,im excited for that game you guys are great but i think well put up a good fight and hopefully win or at least keep it close maybe well have jeremy back by then
nba,not_removed,once middleton comes back watch out
nba,not_removed,wheeeeeeeee
nba,not_removed,boooo
nba,not_removed,technically i dont think it did the logo was a big dumb
nba,not_removed,forgot about that it really was destined wasnt it
nba,not_removed,twentolsix
nba,not_removed,i think hes from overseas hes got a real weird accent
nba,not_removed,dont let him get too close to your armshoulder
nba,not_removed,at least the boston guy is self aware
nba,not_removed,yall lonely
nba,not_removed,escort him over there arent you the team captain of the kids table
nba,not_removed,how
nba,not_removed,never add the s it ruins jokes dont listen to the haters
nba,not_removed,oh then it wasnt funny
nba,not_removed,gobert is gonna be dpoy
nba,not_removed,clippers just doing clipper things
nba,not_removed,james harden is the man
nba,not_removed,plus the pelicans actually have better players in jrue and ad
nba,not_removed,pretty sure the odds had no favored tonight though
nba,not_removed,worse record has nothing to do with an upset or rather its not everything to do with it different sites had the game listed as no and lal more or less a pick em
nba,not_removed,thats what i thought as well lakers definitely look better than the pelicans to me
nba,not_removed,the thing that makes them a win to me is that their bench would be awesome too being able to have quality rotation guys on the floor no matter what every minute of the regular season counts for a lot in the playoffs though they probably wouldnt be top heavy enough to beat the cavs tldr still would be better than whatever shit show we have below cleveland these days
nba,not_removed,sometimes when you shitpost you gotta take the l
nba,not_removed,got it makes it even more apparent how crazy it was that duncan was able to be so good for most of last year defensively given his age
nba,not_removed,makes sense that sort of thing takes awhile to gel
nba,not_removed,as a magic fan i really enjoyed dedmon playing for us chaotic and raw but energetic and a team player hope he develops well with the spurs
nba,not_removed,maybe one day warriors fans will understand that no one cares about the regular season
nba,not_removed,damn thats nuts i wouldnt be surprised if someone would have won even more money with todays nba games considering how heavily favored the match ups were
nba,not_removed,ive heard that ufc is one of the best sports to bet on because underdogs win all the damn time
nba,not_removed,how does the spread work for ufc
nba,not_removed,did you see the article about the guy who parlayed all and new orleans to win bet and won last night
nba,not_removed,at least it showed you the error of your ways early on
nba,not_removed,boooooo
nba,not_removed,mmmm ill allow it
nba,not_removed,my neck my back
nba,not_removed,ive been laughing in the quiet section of the library for the past minute and i dont know why
nba,not_removed,maybe mike conley has some ideas
nba,not_removed,aint that the truth
nba,not_removed,well see how strong the east is this year when the cavs make the finals with games played
nba,not_removed,i wanted him to hit the one at the one and somehow hit himself
nba,not_removed,i got the key key key i got the key key key
nba,not_removed,this years myplayer isnt that great not a big fan of the way they set it up id just play myleague or some shit
nba,not_removed,point forward with max wingspan is probably quadruple double and city
nba,not_removed,i have the same exact build except im primarily a pg but also get played as a sg its worth noting that quad doubles are a lot easier to get if you play full quarters which i do unfortunately the announcers dont say shit when you make history and get one
nba,not_removed,i forgot the s behind my comment sorry
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,which was of course a l for the nfls marketing department
nba,not_removed,literally the dumbest thing ever
nba,not_removed,i like it lol go win some more please
nba,not_removed,the swagger is very exuberant my man well done
nba,not_removed,hands empty from all those missing picks
nba,not_removed,implying the trail blazers are part of this group
nba,not_removed,ow lol
nba,not_removed,pistons and bucks moved above them with their wins today
nba,not_removed,the magic of tiebreakers
nba,not_removed,isnt the definition of hater a celtics fan
nba,not_removed,oh shit celtic on laker crime oh shit
nba,not_removed,you do not love basketball enough then s
nba,not_removed,i thought it was
nba,not_removed,yeah and since the spurs rox and clips lost tonight its only fair fhe only other top team in fhe west takes an l their next game thursday gon be fun
nba,not_removed,enough to beat the cavs httpsstreamablecombwwu
nba,not_removed,we won because of defense the problem was that offensively we were stagnant because even if timmy was still a great defender his offense disappeared altogethr
nba,not_removed,what stupid logic whats the point of the regular season then whats the point in any games
nba,not_removed,maybe one day cavs fans will stop holding onto the past
nba,not_removed,well the regular season determines whether the team makes it to the playoffs so yeah everyone pretty much does
nba,not_removed,its like for every gs game
nba,not_removed,its true and sometimes the disparities between favorites and underdogs are huge its a very unpredictable sport and even if youre a d fighter taking on a aaa fighter on days notice it only takes well timedlucky punch to shock the world
nba,not_removed,i remember checking and seeing pretty heavy favorites on the prelims and then more even on the undercards with the main event for the last one i think mcgregor was like
nba,not_removed,if you pick a money line for the fighter vegas chooses the odds thats for them to just win the fight or you can get pretty close to even odds every time if you accept what round vegas gives you for that fighter to win in sorry if that doesnt make sense
nba,not_removed,bruh
nba,not_removed,too soon
nba,not_removed,no you root for the cowboys again
nba,not_removed,theres a chance maybe less of that happening
nba,not_removed,there it is
nba,not_removed,god no were in the mentally handicapped table
nba,not_removed,can i join
nba,not_removed,fuckin roasted him
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,considering were defending champs its not really the past
nba,not_removed,chillbro
nba,not_removed,yeah i saw that on the screenshot some underdogs were like but i dont know what the number is i know nothing of ufc
nba,not_removed,is a lot of money but holy shit that dudes butt must have been puckered going into that fight
nba,not_removed,okay it might be games you realize they lost two games last year and if you think the hawks will take a game off them this year because i think youre
nba,not_removed,we know we dont belong these days but we refuse to sit anywhere else
nba,not_removed,its about as much of the past as warriors title
nba,not_removed,most cavs fans seem to be focusing on the past season and their chip instead of this season
nba,not_removed,k
nba,not_removed,it means if you bet and win you get
nba,not_removed,nah you good you guys are the grader that got held back but none of us are brave enough to tell you to move for fear that one day youll beat the shit out of us
nba,not_removed,thats factually incorrect by about a year
nba,not_removed,not at all were celebrating because were the reigning champs thats happening presently
nba,not_removed,what about minus like minus
nba,not_removed,ohh i see thanks
nba,not_removed,this is such an apt analogy golf clap
nba,not_removed,its still in the past its no different as each of the last last two years has zero impact on what will happen this season theres a reason why the amount of teams that repeat are so low fact is cavs and warriors are the past two years in titles won so really its not like cavs fans should be mentioning last year like it means anything this year it was a great performance to win last year but its a new season
nba,not_removed,i guess thats one way to put it but when youre talking about what happened in the nba finals last season more than youre talking about whats happening right now it certainly seems like youre clinging to the past
nba,not_removed,bet to win
nba,not_removed,no spreads just money lines
nba,not_removed,no sadly we traded ashton kutcher
nba,not_removed,welcome back
nba,not_removed,he looked good for the limited minutes he played and it was clear he wanted to get back out there hope he gets the opportunity celtics gonna enter the game against cle with something to prove
nba,not_removed,true
nba,not_removed,frogs gay gay frogs
nba,not_removed,wheres kyle korv i mean ashton kutcher with the camera
nba,not_removed,glad i missed this game
nba,not_removed,splashton kutcher
nba,not_removed,great comment
nba,not_removed,justin threeber
nba,not_removed,how was boot camp
nba,not_removed,anyone got games post game thread or better yet a brief primer on how the fuck to search for things i tried entering all that in the search bar and i get stuff from years ago
nba,not_removed,some people just want to witness chaos
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,its easier to just use google and adding the score gives better results for postgame threads make sure to put the word reddit in your phrase example reddit post game cavaliers
nba,not_removed,ysk you can use google to search just reddit threads by typing siteredditcomrnba game thread finals
nba,not_removed,are you saying you didnt watch game live
nba,not_removed,only threads from the finals are the ones gsw fans hanged themselves from fam
nba,not_removed,kd signed as an fa there was no trade heres the players tribune page httpwwwtheplayerstribunecomkevindurantnbafreeagencyannouncement heres the thread
nba,not_removed,its easier to just use google and adding the score gives better results for postgame threads make sure to put the word reddit in your phrase example reddit post game cavaliers
nba,not_removed,oh right my bad haha and thanks i appreciate it 👍🏻
nba,not_removed,sweet thanks man
nba,not_removed,will play for your team for the rest of his career is a no brained then isnt it
nba,not_removed,does lebron still grow or is lebron at his level forever because if he grows into the same player then is a no brainer you get him for longer
nba,not_removed,well seeing as ill get all if i pick the youngest one
nba,not_removed,id prefer the lebronest version of lebron
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,definitely you want the most lebron you can get
nba,not_removed,if you get the growth you take the youngest one if were stuck with the lebron forever then its to me since that was the best athlete lebron
nba,not_removed,lebron thats peak offense and defense with a great working jumpshot that was one of the most dominant players ive ever seen and he deserved to be the unanimous mvp that year
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,the youngest one
nba,not_removed,i mean obviously since you know more lebron but also because our core is young i dont see how anybody wouldnt pick lebron if it was a year rental even if youre a contender right now is the best one since you still have a dude who can play a really high level while also having a great future
nba,not_removed,lebron was the best lebron athleticism mixed with skill
nba,not_removed,any lebron
nba,not_removed,lebron so he is still young enough to be coachable and under pop he would evolve faster
nba,not_removed,id take lebron age syncs up with kyrie love and tt very well would have a solid years left of them playing great ball together
nba,not_removed,i will not comply with your selection wise lebron all httpsiytimgcomviwfqpsdcyoaqhqdefaultjpg
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,lebron on the clips dynasty
nba,not_removed,would you rather have more extra years of lebron or not wow this is such an interesting question man thanks for posting
nba,not_removed,the retired one i cant stand him
nba,not_removed,um the james one
nba,not_removed,definitely a no brained
nba,not_removed,no brain used
nba,not_removed,i would have argued him at his peak for us because we have all our players in their primes and having lebron as well would guarantee us rings for the next years guaranteed but if he does grow best to get his youngest and maybe lose out on a ring or two for like more down the line as lebron grows
nba,not_removed,lebron will still grow
nba,not_removed,doesnt really make sense even i would want his youngest version on the warriors even though all of our players are in their primes and championship window for us is these next years this hypothetical means you get years of one of the goats
nba,not_removed,dont worry once he retires his son will come to continue the eastern conference dominance
nba,not_removed,booooo
nba,not_removed,it really dosnt take a no brained scientist to figure this one out
nba,not_removed,sure just like jordans son im still waiting for one of kemps kids to start dominating the boards
nba,not_removed,yeahim just realizing now that this was a stupid question
nba,not_removed,bron has sons so atleast of them should make it and thus rule the east for many years to come
nba,not_removed,jordan has two sons too but neither of them made it to the nba
nba,not_removed,damnit
nba,not_removed,i love the fact you just gave but never interrupt a cleveland fan servicing his leboner in midstroke
nba,not_removed,the w from game cancels out this l tho
nba,not_removed,for sure gonna be interesting seeing how it goes next year realistically tho well be seeing each other for awhile so might as well do a best of or championships
nba,not_removed,wow its like rain on your wedding day
nba,not_removed,mo is gone bruv
nba,not_removed,brad miller
nba,not_removed,more coincidental than ironic imo
nba,not_removed,rnbamildlyinteresting
nba,not_removed,and clevelands drought lasted years
nba,not_removed,mcrae to score pts in a game this season confirmed
nba,not_removed,maybe mo is passing the with his retiring
nba,not_removed,a free ride but you already paid
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,its singing ironic when there are no ironies
nba,not_removed,its like spoons when all you needed was a knife
nba,not_removed,you heard it here first folks cavs have a chance of winning
nba,not_removed,so what you are saying is that it could go either way
nba,not_removed,we gonna be shampionship
nba,not_removed,yeah but if anybodys gonna beat a statistic like this its the warriors i mean they were the first team since to comeback from a deficit in the cf theyve already beaten a stat like this theyve proved enough to make this not worry me at all about them winning
nba,not_removed,looks like sweep is due again to even it up
nba,not_removed,mixed feelings about both nba and nhl finals this year id love for gs to win because itd be great for them to cap their incredible season with a title but also the city of cleveland deserves a championship of any kind in the nhl the sharks have never made it to the finals let alone won a championship so itd be great to see that city and organization win but the penguins hold a bit of my heart as i was a huge crosby fan growing up cant really pick a team to cheer for in either league which takes away from the excitement a bit
nba,not_removed,oooh more statistics for the next two days
nba,not_removed,if the warriors season has taught me anything its that history doesnt mean crap to this team
nba,not_removed,whats the point of posting this if its literally almost dead even
nba,not_removed,big if true amirite
nba,not_removed,big if true
nba,not_removed,personally i wouldnt consider this anything to beat by either team the historical record being pretty much even doesnt seem to suggest much for this series
nba,not_removed,no city deserves a championship you build a team and you compete simple as that at the end of the day its a business
nba,not_removed,cleveland deserves to have its nose rubbed in its own faeces
nba,not_removed,the only time nearly as insufferable as the offseason is this gap
nba,not_removed,its pretty much the losing team gets revenge unless you have russell on your team or jordan or mikan
nba,not_removed,by city i mean the fans those fans deserve a championship the last time a cleveland team won a major professional sports championship was the browns in there are year old sports fans that have never witnessed a home team of theirs win a championship that sucks
nba,not_removed,as someone who was born in a small market indianapolis and lives in la i can say with authority that you have no idea what you are talking about when you deem deserve especially if you exist as a lakers fan deserve is subjective but to say it from a position of a winning team completely misses the point with championships and finals appearances in the last years the lakers are the outlier of outliers in kobes career he made finals in full seasons not counting the injured ones that doesnt happen times they went to the playoffs only twice did they not get out of the first round and times kobe made the postseason they competed for the championship kobe is an all timer who worked his ass off but did he work harder than lbj malone either wade bird magic nash etc i doubt the level he worked as in he earned the right was so significantly higher than his peers that it vaulted him in there you also have to realize the mindset of cold weather fans i have friends from indy who get legitimately depressed with the pacers and colts season ends not the sad lets get a few drinks depressed its the i dont want to go to work because im going through a divorce type of depression even beyond that there is the odds teams in most leagues that means that teams have a chance all things being equal of winning a title lets then say that at least of the teams make the playoffs its as low at in mlb and as high as in the nbanhl each time one of those happens without a championship it becomes a bit harder to swallow do cleveland buffalo or minnesota fans deserve to suffer from bad slot draws because thats essentially what determines championships heres a list for you lakers probably lose in the finals in if not for the perkins injury boards are the reason celts lost they might lose the wcf if artest is in a different location after kobe airballs the in game lakers probably should have lost in with sacramento david sterns finest hour sacramento built a great team did they deserve to be cheated by the refs lakers didnt deserve shaq anymore than another team he just happened to want to move to la because of movies lakers didnt deserve to get pau gasol in one of the most lopsided trades in history especially after kobe spent the entire offseason trying to get traded to chicago if bird calls a play for anyone other than travis best in who decided to shoot over shaq the game doesnt go into ot and the series is not building a team has nothing to do with winning one year after year it comes down to luck the draw and matchups my favorite example is in the nfl in the packers won the super bowl after going on a magical underdog run through the playoffs the road team in each game they wouldnt be in there however if for the simple fact that the new york giants kicked a punt to the philadelphia eagles with no time on the clock the eagles returned it for a touchdown and won the game this game was in week if not for this kick return the giants not the packers make the playoffs there is no business no building based on the odds based on the fact that the teams in almost every city have been putting out competitive teams even philly id say they deserve a championship if only based on the raw odds of it all for cleveland to be in the major sports since their last title id say their fans who support the team and the organizations which create teams to win deserve one just as equally as ny boston la miami or chicago
nba,not_removed,offseason is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay worse than any other time of the season
nba,not_removed,or curry
nba,not_removed,burning jerseys and leaving arena early before the game ends really deserve a championship i reckon
nba,not_removed,again fans dont deserve anything either we dress up in weird jerseys and wear face paint i just dont understand this argument cubs fans dont deserve anything if they win this year it is because they are the best
nba,not_removed,lakers fan this comment now makes sense
nba,not_removed,maybe deserve isnt the right word i think i just sympathize with them as im from edmonton the oilers havent won a championship in my lifetime and have been about as shitty as you can be for the last ten years it sucks having a shitty team especially when it drags on for so long so maybe they dont deserve a championship in the literal sense of the word but itd make me happy to see them enjoy that experience as i understand how shitty it is to never get to see your team win a championship and im only i cant imagine being and still never getting to enjoy that
nba,not_removed,yes because logical comments are dependent on what team you root for great logic there
nba,not_removed,why does he deserve it
nba,not_removed,wellits not cleveland or its fans its the players and staff who have worked hard to get where they are lebron is still an amazing player and leader who has helped develop his team so if its anyone for cleveland its him unfortunately for them gs is a better team so one could argue they deserve it more
nba,not_removed,thats not what i asked i simply asked why does one player ever deserve a championship over another most work incredibly hard
nba,not_removed,lol fucking idiot
nba,not_removed,just to tell the lakers fans that they at least got a meeting
nba,not_removed,the dont have the money to sign anyone at all if kd says yes ill come then they move blake or dj and bring on kd theyre not wasting their time because theres nothing else to do with their time
nba,not_removed,theyre offering him to sign for a reduced cost so they can make a team of cp jj kd bg dj either way even if the clips were offering him a full salary at the expense of losing blake or dj they dont have much of a shot at kd if he says no youve failed to sign a guy that probably wouldnt be that interested anyway and lost nothing in the highly unlikely case that he says yes you have a killer lineup basically gambling with nothing to lose
nba,not_removed,i really dont think were losing sleep over this i think both parties know that its almost impossible to give kd what he wants if its money but if kds saying yeah ill sit down with you then youre going to put together something to pitch him also consider a situation where kd signs the year option with okc and then hits fa again the following year who knows whatll happen to the big after this next year apparently has an early termination option in if were to leave wed then have the money to actually pitch kd and if im kd id be more open to listening to offers from a team that attempted to pitch me something the year before than just saying fuck it
nba,not_removed,hey we are playing with house money and you dont say no to a meeting with kd plus they know if they figure out a way to get kd we will get a bunch of rig chasers on the cheap everything to gain nothing to lose
nba,not_removed,no deandre drama this summer gotta do something with all that time
nba,not_removed,why not at the very least its a good look for them to get a meeting with a top player who isnt taking that many meetings at all
nba,not_removed,because they are the premier franchise in la right now why would durant go to some bottom feeding shitshow promising movies and tv deals
nba,not_removed,they night as well try
nba,not_removed,they have mil
nba,not_removed,op is suggesting youre gambling your time with nothing to win
nba,not_removed,lol bottom feeding shit show at least we have a future what do the clips have the only bright thing i see in their future is bg
nba,not_removed,probably wont be able to get you anything in this market
nba,not_removed,how is that assuming they dont resign jamal austin aldrich and jeff green you arent going to get any one guy for mil who will replace them not even close
nba,not_removed,dont think a couple of hours will hurt
nba,not_removed,well clippers only have mle and vet deals to offer fa if they are going to resign their own fa
nba,not_removed,probably someone like solomon hill which would be an upgrade for lac if he plays the way that he did in the playoffs
nba,not_removed,they have austin and greens bird rights pierce may retire freeing up mil also all of those guys are replaceable
nba,not_removed,i agree
nba,not_removed,hopefully durant immediately lets teams know when theyre out of the running
nba,not_removed,flying out to new york and then back to la is more than hours bro
nba,not_removed,not when you look at reported offers every fa is about to get this summer
nba,not_removed,ah well that changes everything
nba,not_removed,thats not what im saying i like that we are meeting with him im just saying that your statement was incorrect
nba,not_removed,use some basic ratios google tells me shaq is the rim is you are your minishaq sized rim would be around feet this wont give you the optimal shaxperience since your wingspan is properly considerably shorter than shaq similarly compare the size of a ball to shaqs hand size youll find that theyre about the same so youre looking a volleyball sized ball
nba,not_removed,i tried it out my own way taking athleticism into the math shaq standing reach with a vertical of at pre draft combine so i use this to say shaq could probably catch a ball with its center at in the air ordinary citizen using average standing reach data for pre draft players that are i donno about you guys but i doubt my max vertical is more than this means at most i could catch a ball with its midpoint about standard rims are in the air that means shaq could reach a full above the rim thats of the rim height for our ordinary fellow to reach that level of proportional dominance the rim would have to be at about above the ground with a ball reaching ability this would probably allow the person to achieve monster hand dunks maybe even hang with enough force to break the backboard im about any carpenters in the area wanna help me feel like shaq
nba,not_removed,not entirely relevant but i remember reading something in a sports illustrated for kids that may interest you it said to find the height of a goal you should be able to dunk on get your height in inches and multiply it by according to their scaling system you should be able to dunk on a rim it makes sense is about nba average and that would scale just under
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,if he was scaled down to normal human height assuming he still keeps his frame hed be in professional american football
nba,not_removed,post game you would go home and make love to a midget thats the most disturbing yet accurate description of shaqs post game ever
nba,not_removed,midgets wow i dont wanna be a minishaq
nba,not_removed,i have oft wondered no need for your fancy english this aint ap lit
nba,not_removed,normal stature kek whatever you say manlet
nba,not_removed,wow youre short
nba,not_removed,and other appendages wife wants to know
nba,not_removed,rtheydidthemath
nba,not_removed,rims not pal
nba,not_removed,sounds about right i had one of those adjustable hoops growing up and i would drop it down to and play against my brother and his friends who were grades below sometimes we would play with a youth size basketball that was the closest i got to the shaq experience it was also super easy to hit outside shots but im sure that would be different story if the rim was scaled down
nba,not_removed,just get one of those fisher price basketball hoops
nba,not_removed,i think most people have above vert
nba,not_removed,thats only accounting the height difference between him and shaq though if you do a percentage difference the hoop would only be inches aka slightly higher than feet
nba,not_removed,thats not how you do proportions feet inch tall rim
nba,not_removed,clearly i should have focused on more maths and less lit
nba,not_removed,well i dont fuck pumpkins by choice
nba,not_removed,when will they learn
nba,not_removed,i feel like im reading the mail in my ok cupid account
nba,not_removed,im on a good day lol wish i was
nba,not_removed,average male height is like lol
nba,not_removed,not sure what the question is exactly either we have to shrink your penis or your wife has to shrink to to match shaqs sos size
nba,not_removed,its known that shaq is not packing
nba,not_removed,sorry i lost your edit im not your pal buddy
nba,not_removed,found you
nba,not_removed,playing against little kids is our nba
nba,not_removed,i want one i could hang on
nba,not_removed,does this take into account his wingspan his long arms should play a part in this
nba,not_removed,maybe more graphics and some of those catchy sound effects that radio talk show hosts use thats what gets the people going
nba,not_removed,what are the names of your other accounts
nba,not_removed,they will never learn
nba,not_removed,you have a wife and okc account lucky
nba,not_removed,we all wish we were a little bit taller
nba,not_removed,its
nba,not_removed,were talking midget territory then apparently midgets max out a relatively speaking shaq would have to fuck someone taller that to get out of his approximate midget territory
nba,not_removed,im not your buddy friend
nba,not_removed,squashhunter gourdout thegreatblumpkin
nba,not_removed,til one of my best friends is in midget territory brb schoolyard bully genes kicking in
nba,not_removed,im not your friend guy
nba,not_removed,you arent a dwarf unless you own a battle axe
nba,not_removed,thats right i forgot about that wait i thought they preferred to be called little people and is dwarf really that much better i start thinking of hobbits and shit when i hear dwarf anyway enough about soccer
nba,not_removed,i thought dwarfs and midgets were two different categories and the proper term for midgets was little people ive always heard that one of them has proportional limbs and features and the other has limbs and features more proportional to the average person than to one of their stature
nba,not_removed,i dont say midget but i absolutely refuse to call someone a dwarf ive read lord of the rings too many times i guess
nba,not_removed,which is hilarious because dwarf sounds so much for offensive honestly though if you not you specifically think midget is offensive you need to change some priorities up
nba,not_removed,the plight of midgets
nba,not_removed,im not your guy bro
nba,not_removed,this is the real answer
nba,not_removed,yeah youre right theyre different categories midget is a small person with equal proportions dwarf is the guy from game of thrones normal head and torso small arms and legs
nba,not_removed,or perhaps you need to respect other peoples sensitivities a little more
nba,not_removed,i mean what if youre a midget and you think midget is offensive though i agree that dwarf sounds worse to me but im willing to use it if another term offends someone
nba,not_removed,when you dont get the reference
nba,not_removed,i cant help if someone is offended by a word it is not offensive to call a midget a midget unless they are offended by it its a choice to be offended not a universal law im not saying an inherently bad thing its not like i go up to them and say yo whats up ya fuckin worthless midget ill gladly not say something around people if i know they dont like it doesnt mean i dont think its dumb and i dont say some things around people im not familiar with i say retarded a lot but i dont go around saying it around random people
nba,not_removed,i just wouldnt say it around them anyway im not gonna introduce or meet a midget and say hey this is my midget friend do you do shit like that if i ever say midget its just referring to someone who may be a midget or just really short not directly to them if a midget is offended by it then thats their problem and ill respect it but if i say it around someone who gets offended by it and i dont know it i dont wanna be fuckin lectured about it
nba,not_removed,im not your reference fam
nba,not_removed,right i feel largely the same way but the post i responded to was dismissive hence my reply
nba,not_removed,yeah i just over explain a lot lol its a problem
nba,not_removed,hate on some of these guys all you want but at the end of the day curry lebron durant these are all really good dudes they give back to their community spend time with fans they do everything not saying mj or chuck or many old ballers were bad people but were lucky to have the superstars in the nba we have today they all really care and give back more than old nba superstars or stars in other sports
nba,not_removed,hes gonna die from cancer but at least he didnt blow a lead in the finals
nba,not_removed,kd still goes to seattle every now and then to do some stuff for them iirc
nba,not_removed,not durant its a joke holy shit scum people
nba,not_removed,wow what a piece of shit comment dude totally uncalled for
nba,not_removed,woah youre kind of a dick
nba,not_removed,i know we like to joke but judas did a lot for okc
nba,not_removed,if you really believe that youre just a hater durant gave millions of dollars after okc was wrecked by a hurricane has recently been in the media for going to san quentin and spending time with the inmates and has always been good with fans
nba,not_removed,thats boston in a nutshell
nba,not_removed,kd is a good guy at heart and did a lot of good things for okc but the millions of dollars werent his that he gave not trying to discredit him just want to credit the people that donated to that cause
nba,not_removed,yea he did edit excuse me though a million not millions
nba,not_removed,this is really sad dude cant get justice because the system cant or wont do anything about the thugs who are threatening his life
nba,not_removed,well that sucks bobby simmons was my favorite clipper back when he won mip
nba,not_removed,when he finally walked out the door he broke into a sprint and giggled as he ran away
nba,not_removed,his first problem was wearing a gold chain out in public celebs dont even wear that stuff without company around them
nba,not_removed,i thought it said ben simmons and was wondering why meeks crew jumped him
nba,not_removed,cant remember the name of the nba player crittenton i think who shot someone over his chain in the nba
nba,not_removed,and then the bucks paid him a shit ton of money and then nothing
nba,not_removed,scariest part of the article
nba,not_removed,that or the fact that the getaway driver in the incident sued simmons
nba,not_removed,honey nut lebron james
nba,not_removed,would be nice if kg gets a position with the wolves coaching front office scouting whatever they could use him to mold kat into the ultimate superstar
nba,not_removed,httpawesomegifscomwpcontentuploadsnogif
nba,not_removed,back off lue he is practicing with the clippers already
nba,not_removed,as much as i would love coach kg theres two issues im fairly certain he already said he didnt want to coach after retirement it seems that might be changing what with him being out in la right now but he seemed pretty emphatic about it last season when people were hoping that hed become a coach or partowner in the next few years im not sure how well he would do with thibs being around or how well thibs would do with him around theyre both pretty strong personalities with definite ideas about how to play basketball it could be something amazing but it could also result in some sort of staffing implosion if they dont see eye to eye
nba,not_removed,banned fake news rip
nba,not_removed,why would you want to get banned before the finals
nba,not_removed,missed the free throw tho
nba,not_removed,oh man am i going to root for houston this playoffs im going to root for houston this playoffs
nba,not_removed,baby come back you can blame it all on me
nba,not_removed,wingardium louviosa
nba,not_removed,as a man whos watched jamal crawford for several years i cant believe the refs still fall for this
nba,not_removed,watch lou pull this kind of magic shit in the wcf against the warriors
nba,not_removed,this shit was so clutch too bad we fucking suck tonight and couldnt pull it off only lou will was shooting well tonight
nba,not_removed,trade of the century
nba,not_removed,good stuff lou get in the playoffs soon son
nba,not_removed,ball dont lie that call was shit
nba,not_removed,weve got a pretty fun team to watch first time since high paced high scoring lots of tough shots and watching harden pass is fun
nba,not_removed,i was wroooong
nba,not_removed,any kind of fool could see
nba,not_removed,maybe a team rebuilding whos timeline doesnt match up with lou being on the team if only they got a draft pick with brewer or something who the fuck would let this guy go in fa for a year though fucking idiots
nba,not_removed,tank commander
nba,not_removed,a team that needs a tank commander
nba,not_removed,seriously didnt they say there stop calling those kick calls such a blatant kick to create contact
nba,not_removed,i know its also fun to see dantoni matched again with a team built for his style rather than like probably the worst players ever for his style kobe and dwight
nba,not_removed,where the rodrigue beaubois hype train at edit while this comment is popular ill never forget we couldve traded him for the pick that became who our front office liked 🐴🔫
nba,not_removed,beasley
nba,not_removed,mcw
nba,not_removed,iman shumpert
nba,not_removed,tyreke evans
nba,not_removed,heres a random one eric maynor was starting to look like he was going to develop into a starter worthy pg in the league when he was with okc didnt think he was going to be out of the league by
nba,not_removed,derrick williams
nba,not_removed,i thought terrence ross was gonna grow into what derozan is today
nba,not_removed,i didnt think adreian payne would be great but i thought hed be a solid rotational player hes got great size for a is super athletic and has an ok shooting stroke the dude just has no basketball iq you always see him missing rotations on defense being in the wrong place on offence etc
nba,not_removed,jimmer fredette
nba,not_removed,lamb
nba,not_removed,dion waiters but just as i lost hope he blossomed
nba,not_removed,i was really high on mkg and thomas robinson before the draft i wanted them both over beal at different points i thought mkg was going to become what kawhi is now and thomas robinson was going to be an amare like big man and tenacious on the glass
nba,not_removed,list of people i believed would finally be our answer to our sf problem danny granger lance stephenson jeff green jared dudley
nba,not_removed,not to be a dick to you but paul george dont get me wrong paul george is a bonified allstar and a top defender but ive really come to expect more out of him he has an incredible nba body and all the physical tools to be an alltime player hes a good shooter and i really thought he could have gotten up to a durantlebron lvl this season after a fully healthy one last season dont get me wrong hes great but i always thought he could have been alltime
nba,not_removed,oj mayo also sebastian telfair
nba,not_removed,pg ricky rubio sg oj mayo sf michael beasley pf perry jones c thomas robinson hms iman shumpert i thought mkg would be better mcw knight shannon brown edit i also forgot jeff green
nba,not_removed,i thought mike beasley was gonna be better than durant and derrick favors would be better than bosh i guess the latter is technically true
nba,not_removed,tyreke evans looked like the next d wade to me as a rookie but he has slowly gotten worse every season
nba,not_removed,demar decarrolle
nba,not_removed,kyle anderson hes not bad but i thought of him as the next boris diaw instead of whatever he is now
nba,not_removed,felipe lópez
nba,not_removed,jan vesely hype train anyone his draft stock looked so insane super athlete and now hes overseas
nba,not_removed,jeff green but thats probably gonna be said by like every cs fan here shumpert is def someone i was pretty high on he was one of the few knicks ive liked over the past years and since i live in nyc i got to watch him pretty often he was and still is a great defender super athletic and has a nice looking jumper and had that fresh ass fadeall the tools there to develop into a great player but he never took off after that knee injury
nba,not_removed,mario hezonja not looking good for him so far
nba,not_removed,greatness i dont think that about too many players except for kat and porzingis recently a player who i thought was going to be good like franchise pg level was trey burke i know hes undersized but that was the only main red flag for him however in his yearhe looked so overwhelmed he still has a lot of time to turn it aroundlook at kemba however he just looks like a decent backup pg and nothing more
nba,not_removed,marquis daniels devin harris josh howard think they were all coming off the bench at one point thought the mavs were all set for the future
nba,not_removed,corey brewer he took over games in college in every way defense and scoring he was with a lot of room to fill out i thought he was going to be the best player from that back to back championship florida team and become a star in the league
nba,not_removed,landry fields he had an amazing rookie year on the knicks and then turned into pure garbage
nba,not_removed,wrote this earlier today but ill just say it again bill walker he was an absolute physical specimen iirc he was a recruit coming out of hs and some draft pundits believed hed have been a lottery pick if not for constant knee injuries i thought it was an absolute steal when the cs took him in the second round it wasnt injuries that got in his way it was just a lack of focus and ultimately a lack of talent well still always have this wonderful however
nba,not_removed,beasley
nba,not_removed,weeks ago i would have said dion waiters
nba,not_removed,jimmer
nba,not_removed,brandon jennings exum too terrence jones
nba,not_removed,sundiata gaines after he hit this shot yeahthat didnt really pan out
nba,not_removed,beasley was supposed to domnate ha
nba,not_removed,im not ready to give up on dante yet
nba,not_removed,lamar odom dont get me wrong the guy wasnt a bust by any means nba titles man of the year award but his skill set and versatility had me believed he had the potential to be an alltime great hope the guy is doing okay nowadays
nba,not_removed,evan turner and victor oladipo edit and shved
nba,not_removed,well i got a little caught up in linsanity i though he could have been a mike conley level star its a little early on okafor but i was hoping for more i was a big tyreke evans fan his rookie year thought hed be an all star same for oj mayo i thought jennings was gonna be really good after good after his rookie year jabari was going to be a stud but injuries got to him early on but hes starting to look really nice i was hoping for more from elfrid payton
nba,not_removed,im ready to admit itjah
nba,not_removed,i thought that oj mayo was going to be an allstar and that minnesota were fools for flipping him for kevin love
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,monta ellis when he was on the warriors i remember being so angry he was traded away
nba,not_removed,i thought brandon roy would be the best player at his position for years to come the injuries were too much to overcome but he was extremely fun to watch
nba,not_removed,i thought brandon roy would be the best player at his position for years to come the injuries were too much to overcome but he was extremely fun to watch
nba,not_removed,emeka okafor dude was a beast at uconn nba ready body high basketball iq athleticism had the complete package dont get me wrong he had a very respectable nba career but i thought he was going to be a hall of famer one day
nba,not_removed,anthony randolph
nba,not_removed,antonio mcdyess he was almost great but just never quite got there he could be so explosive and powerful he seemed sean kempesque at times but he never really took it to the next level
nba,not_removed,adam morrison lol
nba,not_removed,brandon jennings after he dropped two weeks into his rookie season
nba,not_removed,i thought devin ebanks would become a trevor ariza like and d guy also jay williams
nba,not_removed,dangelo russell i thought he would be the best player coming out of his draft class i was disappointed that sixers couldnt nab him he had the size and he played great at ohio so far he hasnt developed like i hoped he would
nba,not_removed,penny hardaway or grant hill
nba,not_removed,deron williams
nba,not_removed,never forget the kid who dropped on the dubs in his rookie year
nba,not_removed,you guys would have have drafted giannis too but cuban wanted to save money for a big free agent signing for those who dont know according to cuban donnie nelson really wanted to draft giannis going so far as to say that nelson would have risked everything everything apparently meaning the much maligned plan powder on the belief that giannis was going to be really good so donnie was all in on antetokounmpo wow and what was cubans response but still what if all of the sudden we find out that soandso is dying to come to the mavs and now you dont have the cap room thats why we put together a plan and our consolation wasnt too bad
nba,not_removed,and was so quick that frames in the video cant keep up
nba,not_removed,at least hes not oj mayo
nba,not_removed,i thought he was about to destroy the league
nba,not_removed,beasley just cant put it together this man has shown some flashes
nba,not_removed,that buzzer beater against the heat after returning from heart surgery
nba,not_removed,that awkward moment when you peak in your first game
nba,not_removed,i mean he was a key contributor to a championship team cant ask for much more than that
nba,not_removed,i thought tyreke was going to become basically was going to develop in the mold of lebron and dwyane wade excellent slasher and athlete with great playmaking abilities he had all the tools to do it but for whatever reason his development just came to a halt after his rookiesoph year
nba,not_removed,after his rookie season he got me thinking he would be an all star one day
nba,not_removed,hes just got low iq always second guessing himself despite having one of the smoothest jumpshots in the league
nba,not_removed,maynor is out of the league did he have a serious injury or something ill always remember him shitting on duke in the tournament
nba,not_removed,after he waved kd off and took a last shot he has disappeared he got hurt also but yea i thought he wud be a good player
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i loved him at michigan st he put up against delaware in the ncaa tournament i didnt ever think hed be a star but i thought hed be an elite role player
nba,not_removed,hes so bad im suprised hes managed to stay in the league this long
nba,not_removed,steph is everything i thought jimmer would be
nba,not_removed,check out his highlights this year playing in china hes dropping every night and playing like everyone hoped he would in the nba
nba,not_removed,definitely wasnt a goat
nba,not_removed,on shooting last games hes gonna go on a tear post asg and then show up in the playoffs big like he always does
nba,not_removed,lol it took favors until his year to breakout into a starting player the guy took a long timebut hes a good player now
nba,not_removed,i thought anderson would be a man of the year caliber player give a team ppg and like assists off the bench dude was a great playmaker at ucla
nba,not_removed,i thought he was going to be a good player too create his own mold of freakishly tall pgs i know this isnt true but it doesnt feel like hes developed his game much since college he was really promising from the line at ucla but from the games ive watched he doesnt really shoot it i thought the spurs would be a perfect place for him to develop not all draft picks work out though
nba,not_removed,bynum for a short period was great and wouldve been for a good time if his knees didnt give out on him
nba,not_removed,who could forget
nba,not_removed,i remember when lacob was showered in boos at the arena for trading away monta and chris mullin had to settle them down
nba,not_removed,its been one season
nba,not_removed,he was great
nba,not_removed,he was great at one point i mean i remember for a couple years the top pg discussion was dwill and rondo
nba,not_removed,he was considered the best pg in the league for a few years
nba,not_removed,you were the biggest disappointment of the them all
nba,not_removed,are you not trusting the damn process
nba,not_removed,i thought he would be a stud or at very least a solid player after that game then again literally every one got career nights against us back then
nba,not_removed,they werent the same dubs though
nba,not_removed,its surreal watching roddy b drop treys on steph curry in a grainy video
nba,not_removed,also oj mayo bearded grizzly mayo had potential
nba,not_removed,those first few triple doubles i thought he was legit
nba,not_removed,a couple years ago he was a promising wing along with kawhi butler and paul george he was clearly the worst of the group but the rest improved significantly while he stayed the same
nba,not_removed,as someone who watched him his rookie year and throughout his tenure with the knicks there was a point in time where a lot of people in nyc me included thought hed turn into at least a borderline star
nba,not_removed,kings really halted his development its sucky and each time i think about it it gets me kinda upset the kings basically turned him from a pg into a sf then sg they thought oh hey hes with a near wingspan why not he has played the best ball of his career as a pg or primary ball handler i feel like he almost came into the wrong era a shitload of people crapped on the fact that his playmaking wasnt good enough for a pg whens the last time you saw anyone complain about conleys reke was at and kings seriously fucked up his development he didnt help with the fact that he couldnt shoot but there was almost nothing else he couldnt do look at how much quickness he lost due to them asking him to bulk up too
nba,not_removed,as a rookie i still kinda wonder if he wouldve developed differently if the kings hadnt lucked into boogie
nba,not_removed,i thought the complete opposite it was probably partly because i was being a cynical asshole to my kingsfan buddy but i was always convinced that evans rookie numbers were a product of a shitty team i remember my buddy always citing the fact that tyreke joined mj lebron oscar robertson and charlie scott as the only rookies to average and i remember always pointing out that his two best teammates were kevin martin and carl landry ultimately they ended up being inflated numbers it was the same thing with brandon jennings
nba,not_removed,i still cant believe we got a first round pick for him protected but still
nba,not_removed,ehh hes completely out of the rotation and still on his rookie contract theres no reason for us to waive him unless we wanted that roster spot which we dont
nba,not_removed,im really not big on these in the last x games stats every player has good stretches great players have consistency i would love to see go on a tear post all star break and tear up the playoffs like last year but havent seen it yet that said his game against the rockets the other night was unbelievable
nba,not_removed,players who are going to be great usually make the jump by the end of their third season
nba,not_removed,op likened exum to kobe bryant deron williams best season isnt all that great
nba,not_removed,no he sucked all he did in utah was drive off a hall of fame coach who had been with the organization for over years and then whine himself into a trade after which his career has been nothing but downhill and disappointment the only jersey i ever regret purchasing stupid williams
nba,not_removed,true a discussion that ended fairly quickly with the obvious answer being yeah dwill definitely lost that battle
nba,not_removed,why is this he just didnt want it as bad as those guys
nba,not_removed,most good rookies are usually on bad teams though
nba,not_removed,true consistency has been pauls biggest challenge his entire career
nba,not_removed,its hard to judge the kid based off one season playing under a coach with no real system that was trying to lose as many games as possible and half a season where hes been hurt constantly
nba,not_removed,you sound like a guy that never watched him for a good period of time it was him v in the conversation for best pg in the league
nba,not_removed,if i remember correctly hes been injured a lot
nba,not_removed,tore his acl iirc it was the same day that rose tore his
nba,not_removed,as others said injury but he also played for the knicks
nba,not_removed,thats not untrue but that still doesnt dispute the fact that the numbers could be inflated which was eventually proven to be true
nba,not_removed,with moves like that this kid could score one day
nba,not_removed,is this kid really the new kobe
nba,not_removed,scored against blake griffin deandre jordan and somewhat chris paul all in one fell swoop incredible
nba,not_removed,thats a pretty move
nba,not_removed,so crafty
nba,not_removed,so pretty but also foul on whomever pushed dj so he couldnt contest the shot
nba,not_removed,no kobe was one of the best athletes in the nba on top of his skill booker isnt unathletic by any means but kobe was a for a lot of his career
nba,not_removed,if you aint cheating you aint trying just look at bookers off hand
nba,not_removed,cool
nba,not_removed,all dem mvps
nba,not_removed,devidsternwoderinwhytheleaguelosingmunnypeeplepaytogudmomeytoseeaftheltesplayanstheytrytotakeoverthe fucking game
nba,not_removed,you can tell the reporter immediately regretted telling shaq its live by that instantaneous i know
nba,not_removed,no matter how many times ive seen it this clip never fails to make me laugh
nba,not_removed,shaq always got mauled probably shouldve averaged ft a game
nba,not_removed,i miss the lakers being on kcal
nba,not_removed,i fucking love this clip so much every time its just crazy considering how pissed he is in this moment and yet he was on the other side of what i have heard is unanimously considered a complete officiating decision of the western conference finals in
nba,not_removed,shaq looking straight into the camera is my favorite part of it shows he really didnt give a flying fuck about the live broadcast
nba,not_removed,i know
nba,not_removed,my name is shaquille oneal and paul pierce is the motherfucking truth quote me on that and dont take nothing out
nba,not_removed,boy he was pissed as hell
nba,not_removed,shaq is the best
nba,not_removed,the reporters sad i know is the best part
nba,not_removed,shaq were on live what do you expect him to say after that
nba,not_removed,when was this
nba,not_removed,man id love to see what shaq could have done to the league in fuck you mode those physical gifts with mjs fire
nba,not_removed,that may be one my favorite shaq moment
nba,not_removed,my boy john ireland
nba,not_removed,even just reading the transcript makes me fall over laughing every time
nba,not_removed,holy crap i remember this like it was yesterday i was watching this game with my dad as a kid and i remember being shocked shaq said a bad word haha
nba,not_removed,its funny cuz its true even today
nba,not_removed,i love how he looks into the camera everytime he swears
nba,not_removed,how much did he get fined of a weeks worth salary
nba,not_removed,hardaway better
nba,not_removed,anyone have the exact context of this game why he was so pissed
nba,not_removed,one day john ireland the i know reporter will be our playbyplay voice hes been with the team for years and no one deserves it more the radio commentary is far superior to the twcsn commentary
nba,not_removed,he knows
nba,not_removed,i feel that moment when shaq stares into the camera cross eyed when saying he doesnt give a shit is an accurate representation of the exaggerated aries spears shaq impersonation
nba,not_removed,was this after game of the wcf
nba,not_removed,the sad part is that i understood and read this comment just fine but i am still confused on what shaq said
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,fkn game man
nba,not_removed,this needs more upvotes downvote brigade edit still needs more upvotes
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,yeah well we dont give a shit
nba,not_removed,the big aristotle
nba,not_removed,its why he left lsu when he did because his coach thought he would get a career ending injury with what the refs were allowing against him
nba,not_removed,for his own sake hes probably glad he didnt
nba,not_removed,shaq in todays league might have seen a lot more calls than he did in the past he got held or shoved on damn near every other possession without calls they call a lot more ticky tack foul calls today than they did years ago
nba,not_removed,the tape delay for eastern conference road games sucked though
nba,not_removed,and he rubs it in cwebbs face on an episode of inside the nba i think it was during this years playoffs that was hard to watch cwebb looked like he was going to cry at any moment i will be downvoted for this again but as someone who is neither a laker nor a kings fan that series or at least game was rigged as hell why did the kings not win game you say well if you were playing and realized that no matter what the officials were not going to let you win wouldnt you feel defeated even before the game began i respect the heck outta shaq but he did not deserve that ring
nba,not_removed,unanimously by sore losers and cry babies who didnt watch the series oh and political hacks like ralph nader
nba,not_removed,not sure the year but its a game vs the raptors if you look at the top left at you can see the edit it was
nba,not_removed,haha the term bad word still makes me laugh funny how taboo cussing was as a kid and as an adult its nothing
nba,not_removed,he was getting a lot of uncalled fouls
nba,not_removed,we need someone who speaks shaq to translate
nba,not_removed,nah man it was after game
nba,not_removed,this needs more downvotes
nba,not_removed,i liked it
nba,not_removed,wtf is this
nba,not_removed,i know
nba,not_removed,getting opposing players in foul trouble doesnt sound too bad
nba,not_removed,i dont know points sounds good to me
nba,not_removed,not so much on the bigger stronger bigs players like dwight howard get only the most blatant hacks
nba,not_removed,i dont know big guys like blake dwight and bron get hacked every single time but only get calls some of the time
nba,not_removed,no they dont
nba,not_removed,tell that to boogie
nba,not_removed,shaq in todays league might have seen a lot more calls than he did in the past would he see demarcus cousins
nba,not_removed,wait they did this even in the last seasons leading up to to switching to twc sportsnet
nba,not_removed,wouldnt you feel defecated even before the game began yes i probably would feel really shitty
nba,not_removed,look at the ft stats for game each team won a game they didnt deserve
nba,not_removed,i will be downvoted for this again lmfao
nba,not_removed,your reason for game makes absolutely no sense the kings were mentallly defeated lol it was a point game in overtime and they shot from the free throw line the kings gave it away simple as that the officiating was controversial in games and but hey if you want to act like the entire series was rigged when nothing has been substantialized go for it
nba,not_removed,they didnt choke because they knew the refs would rig it game obviously something crazy happened but the kings still had opportunities to win and had nobody who could step up you think peja airballed because of the refs
nba,not_removed,i dont think the nba was against sac winning the series at all san antonio beat la the very next year and the same logic for why theyd wanna rig the series bigger market more charismatic starsbig names very weak opponent awaiting in the finals applied there i do think they wanted the wcf to go as long as possible which is why game saw a ton of fts the other way which is fucked up but kings fans gotta stop acting like the nba werent gonna let em win the series
nba,not_removed,oh jesus not another supposedly independent voice of reason with his fuckin two cents fuck cwebb fuck ralph nader fuck the queens and no you obviously didnt watch the series
nba,not_removed,they didnt win game because they choked and they choked fucking hard they could have easily taken that game in the finals moments and flubbed it leading to ot where the lakers took control
nba,not_removed,stop it with your lies
nba,not_removed,very much so lol
nba,not_removed,goldilocks found that this comment vote ratio was juuuuuuuuuuuuust right
nba,not_removed,wait this or that
nba,not_removed,apparently for the record it had upvotes when i commentedthen with my vote
nba,not_removed,why does it need downvotes edit give me more downvotes
nba,not_removed,sexy slut harry styles crying
nba,not_removed,oo
nba,not_removed,who could actually guard him though just bringing in a new guy with more fouls to give
nba,not_removed,a foul on shaq is like a flagrant on most nba players even most centers
nba,not_removed,not when you can get more points per possession in the paint
nba,not_removed,yeah back when pekovic was healthy he didnt get any calls because he was so big
nba,not_removed,yeah they still call it differently for big men
nba,not_removed,insert video of cousins dunking over three guys who all foul him
nba,not_removed,ive never seen people on here downvote game was rigged maybe hes talking about on our sub
nba,not_removed,i dont have a horse in this race but if you want to use shooting from the ft line as an argument against being mentally defeated i dont know if you understand thats probably an example of how the kings were mentally defeated
nba,not_removed,i think its hilarious youre getting downvoted for this apparently rnba users that never watched the series know something that the da and fbi dont they should bring forward their evidence amd finally clear this up lmfao
nba,not_removed,shut up dumb bitch
nba,not_removed,smooth move
nba,not_removed,can i give u a downvote
nba,not_removed,also puts your team in the bonus earlier so somebody like kobe could abuse the defense for free throws
nba,not_removed,the crazy thing is it takes a pretty big guy to foul shaq hard enough so he wouldnt get an im and i doubt i would even affect shaqs layup form
nba,not_removed,why not both
nba,not_removed,pekovic is probably the most similar to shaq in build that we have seen he got calls and hit free throws at a high but he is very similar in body type and play style
nba,not_removed,im pretty sure if i went through the whole game complied every bad call in favor of the kings making a minute video and got a mentally unstable referee who was sentenced for his gambling addiction to claim it was rigged people would believe it yeah game had a few more worse calls down the stretch but are we really going to act like the officiating wasnt horrendous in game when the game winning bucket was set up by an illegal screen and when the lakers even filed a protest for bad officiating
nba,not_removed,game would be urban folklore if video didnt exist it was literally unbelievable
nba,not_removed,damn chill fam
nba,not_removed,hell yeah bro
nba,not_removed,lol relax guy
nba,not_removed,flair up pussy
nba,not_removed,yea everyone can
nba,not_removed,you from akron by any chance
nba,not_removed,the only thing similar about them is that they are both big and have a drop step shaq was far more physical then pek on any given day
nba,not_removed,lol i dont know if i would call donaghy mentally unstable sounds like a spin job and no game and arent even close to how badly officiated they were an illegal screen are you serious thats all you can point to
nba,not_removed,yeah cant we cele a good downvote shitstorm in peace
nba,not_removed,haha took my words
nba,not_removed,team instinct
nba,not_removed,haha my body composition is just slightly different from that individuals
nba,not_removed,i didnt mean to say that pek plays like shaq or had as many moves it was meant more like each bullied down low and would just go through people that tried to stop them
nba,not_removed,oh ok so im supposed to list every single call that happened in game there were multiple bad calls in the final period even the free throw disparity argument would work in favor of the lakers in that game shaq shot only free throw and players on the lakers had or more fouls so an illegal screen which was pretty blatant and set up the game winning shot is no where near as important as many missed foul calls most of them which could have went either way except for the cwebb block on kobe and an offensive foul edit also even if you claim that game had way worse officiating at the end of the day both teams still lost a crucial game in the series because of poor officiating dosent matter
nba,not_removed,shaq had free throw in that game ever watched shaq before barely went freaking possession without being fouled let alone an entire playoff game
nba,not_removed,holy shit its glen davis
nba,not_removed,no way man glen davis fingers are too fat for a keyboard
nba,not_removed,maybe he obtained a special typing wand
nba,not_removed,i think it depends if it is a community stadium and will be used a lot outside the nba games they the taxpayers should pay for atleast a good part of it if it is solely for nba games and will be empty when the team leaves anyways then the team should pay for most of it regardless the team should atleast pay a little bit
nba,not_removed,jiannis hardentokounpo
nba,not_removed,the kyle wiltjer imitation is the best part of every harden eurostep
nba,not_removed,he looked like a ballerina a beautiful majestic ballerina
nba,not_removed,its like he has skates on
nba,not_removed,triple jump af
nba,not_removed,man that was so majestic jesus christ
nba,not_removed,greekfreaklike just didnt dunk it
nba,not_removed,so when is it considered a jump
nba,not_removed,been watching giannis film
nba,not_removed,this one is a travel because he doesnt have enough hang time to keep that right foot up but all them other travel complaints are just wrong people always trying to nitpick his play
nba,not_removed,shit took me like ten replays to see it he does step twice with the right foot in the paint initially i only saw the first right step at the ft line and the left step at restricted circle but the right foot kinda drags in the air but makes contact on the floor between the two circles as he hits with down with left foot happens so fast
nba,not_removed,skip skip skip to my lou
nba,not_removed,wesley johnsons defense is just like yea im just going to run back
nba,not_removed,he keeps evolving he walks on water black jesus
nba,not_removed,euroglide
nba,not_removed,a new move prancing drive
nba,not_removed,can someone explain why thats not a travel
nba,not_removed,video starts inside the three
nba,not_removed,harden been gettin away with a lotta bullshit travel wise but that was a great move textbook
nba,not_removed,what a delicious looking gyro step
nba,not_removed,gesundheit
nba,not_removed,lol does he do that every time
nba,not_removed,damn havent heard that name since he was on the oakland soldiers
nba,not_removed,like a graceful deer
nba,not_removed,reminds me of a triple jumper not that im saying was a travel
nba,not_removed,he totally had both feet off the ground during the step portions i guess it would be hard for the ref to see in real time though
nba,not_removed,giannis isnt even fair when he pulls it off that dude goes from feet out and starts it
nba,not_removed,its very clearly not a travel
nba,not_removed,every single eurostep thread
nba,not_removed,hes still gathering the ball as his left foot is on the floor and picks up just at the point line he then takes a very long stop with his right that takes him to about the foul line then back to his left on the low block before laying it in
nba,not_removed,you start calling steps after he gathers from the dribble so his first step hes still gathering from dribble and next two steps are still counted in the two step rule
nba,not_removed,two steps
nba,not_removed,why are you getting downvoted
nba,not_removed,because pro basketball is fucking ridiculous with its traveling rules
nba,not_removed,it would be if this was basketball this is not tho it is nba in nba you start counting the steps when they play has full possession of the ball what harden does is that he let the ball going above his head before catching it so he get a full extra step
nba,not_removed,no
nba,not_removed,gyroooo
nba,not_removed,kyle wiltgod does do that every time and he is in running for best bench celebrator in the nba
nba,not_removed,nah thats giannis
nba,not_removed,considering the distance he covered wouldnt it be impossible to keep one foot on the ground
nba,not_removed,like
nba,not_removed,he cant put his right foot pivot foot down once its up he picks it up and then drags it when he crosses the paint this is a traveling violation edit its strangely satisfying to know that im one of the few people that know the traveling rule
nba,not_removed,after the gather his right foot hits the ground twice and his left once that is steps
nba,not_removed,no its clearly a travel on his first step both of his feet are off the ground and this is coming from a rockets fan
nba,not_removed,that would be fine and dandy if he didnt drag his right foot pivot foot after he picked it up this is a traveling violation edit this is the rule whether or not you agree with it
nba,not_removed,once you raise your pivot foot you have to release the ball before it touches the ground in this case harden gathers establishes his right foot as his pivot foot raises that pivot foot then puts it back on the ground before releasing the ball this is a traveling violation
nba,not_removed,idk i was just asking a sincere question
nba,not_removed,yeah travels make the game unwatchable screw dunks the only thing that brings me joy is when gather step truthers all burn in hell
nba,not_removed,idk what this running for shit is id say hes running away with it
nba,not_removed,probably
nba,not_removed,exactly its really not hard to tell when both feet are off the ground if the person with the ball covers more ground than the length of both feet combined it should be considered a travel the one rule that kinda breaks it is the hop step which is a travesty in its own right theres no reason to count feet land at the same time as step
nba,not_removed,hahahaha hell naw the gyro step
nba,not_removed,that was over years ago wow
nba,not_removed,its the same travel that allen iverson used to do they just never call this in the nba
nba,not_removed,two steps after the gather
nba,not_removed,oh i can see that but i thought he jumped off his left clean
nba,not_removed,look when he gathers the ball its only thats why the ball gather was so exaggerated
nba,not_removed,dont know why youre getting downvoted his right foot clearly comes back down while hes coming across before the layin
nba,not_removed,youre right but had he not done that it would still look like a travel so almost wasnt a travel
nba,not_removed,you are technically right but its such a miniscule mistake in that whole sequence i dont blame the ref for not seeing it in real time honestly probably wouldnt even call it even if he did
nba,not_removed,nay two steps after the gather
nba,not_removed,thats what ill forever call gianniss euro
nba,not_removed,referee here can confirm im not working nba but in training camps they consistently say that putting too many travels in the game hurts ticket sales because the game slows down penalize the obvious but otherwise let athletes do athletic things
nba,not_removed,yes he only has two stepping motions but on the first one both of his feet are off the ground at one time thats a travel
nba,not_removed,watch his right foot it hits the floor again after his first step
nba,not_removed,i do it fits
nba,not_removed,so you are saying he was technically jumping or had left his feet
nba,not_removed,good eye theyre never ever gonna call a travel on him or derozan ive given up analyzing their suspicious layup attempts
nba,not_removed,they never gonna call that he never took a real step with it at most it dragged on the court for a fraction of a second
nba,not_removed,yeah his first step he actually jumps
nba,not_removed,while im not sure personally hes never getting called for that and im not entirely sure he should be in this case
nba,not_removed,i know joakim has been great in the past and i am a biased hater but does this seem like a bit much for where he currently is in his career
nba,not_removed,how are they getting these numbers already i thought they arent allowed to negotiate until july
nba,not_removed,isnt this considered tampering that the info on noahs contract has already leaked just another reason why the moratorium makes little sense well unless your deandre
nba,not_removed,fuck this fucking team i guess anytime you have the opportunity to pay million dollars a year to a year old center coming off shoulder surgery who just averaged ppg and looks like an estonian cockroachs infected dick you just have to do it nothing like the onetwo combo of sasha vujacic and joakim noah the ideal late dynamic duo of fuck this massive douche and give him a muchneeded haircut nothing like having two of the most easilyhateable players of the past decade both on your team well after their primes way to spend that cap space knicks im sure this milkshake will bring all the free agents to your yard go fuck yourself with lalas dildo in the shape of the empire state building except porzingis and langston and lance thomas i guess hornacek seems cool but other than that fuck everything else about this piece of shit team
nba,not_removed,i see his value at around over years with the third year as a team option but im not a fucking gm im just a fan so wtf would i know
nba,not_removed,holy overpay
nba,not_removed,did phil forget a decimal when he made that offer
nba,not_removed,hilarious
nba,not_removed,knicks gonna knick
nba,not_removed,knicks miss playoffs again confirmed
nba,not_removed,i can see why u want noah especially because he could teach porzingis a lot defensively but i think mil was overpay
nba,not_removed,what on earth
nba,not_removed,too much
nba,not_removed,hmm not what i woulda paidby many millions
nba,not_removed,so the bulls came to new york imagine if they sign pau too
nba,not_removed,thats a lot of money for a guy who isnt as good as the guy you just traded away
nba,not_removed,did anyone else have a chance to talk to noah i remember he said hed listen to everyone
nba,not_removed,if these are the contracts that are going to be given away this summer im perfectly content on sitting fa out one year and let all these teams screw themselves over with these contracts
nba,not_removed,i just want noah to be relevant again so he and lebron can go at it
nba,not_removed,why
nba,not_removed,over paying or not it will still be interesting to watch the knicks next season
nba,not_removed,heres comes the classic holy shit what an overpay until people realize the cap is higher and every contract seems like an overpay
nba,not_removed,if joakim is getting theres no way howards only getting
nba,not_removed,watch jimmy buckets somehow find a way to win more games than the knicks next year
nba,not_removed,at this point knicks need to sign deng screw the thereturn its time for reunion
nba,not_removed,dwights getting huh
nba,not_removed,definitely noah is on the wrong side of and a long history of injuries which is why i didnt want the bulls to resign him because to be safe youre going to need a good backup who can step into the starting role if noah is hurt and the bulls dont have the cap space to do something like that
nba,not_removed,i dont know if this is an overpay or if im just not adjusted to the rising cap last summer i was surprised by how much we payed rolo and that ended up being considered a great contract for the team
nba,not_removed,because its probably not true the media has never gotten anything right until arent the fact since phil got here id very surprised if noah gets million per year guaranteed
nba,not_removed,it may not be tampering because the number may not be completely true after last weeks rumor that noah could make million a year with the wiz which isnt possible under the cba its hard to know if this is in fact the real number
nba,not_removed,dont underestimate joakims passing and defensive ability he was defensive player of the year just seasons ago
nba,not_removed,holy overreaction dude the million a year for noah is probably bs because teams cant negotiate before july without it being tampering
nba,not_removed,youll probably get some short term good basketball out of this and hey hornacek isnt rambis so you got that going
nba,not_removed,chill this is probably bs
nba,not_removed,dont try so hard pls
nba,not_removed,but bro look at his per numberss
nba,not_removed,what about langston does he have to get some of lalas dildo too insert dleague pun
nba,not_removed,well said have an upvote
nba,not_removed,yeah noah tops out at mil a year to me anything in eight figures is too much risk seeing as he hasnt played at that level in two years
nba,not_removed,not really considering the new cba
nba,not_removed,just happy its not dwight tbh
nba,not_removed,when did noah sign his mil contract
nba,not_removed,wtf lebron has owned him his whole career they never went at it
nba,not_removed,dwight will definitely get over million even if he doesnt get his desired
nba,not_removed,theyre gonna be in the red if they keep giving out mil contracts
nba,not_removed,but then we traded him away i really dont like the rose deal long term
nba,not_removed,its a bit similar to the nfl free agency period when ndamukong suh signed to the dolphins and his contract got leaked a bunch of days before the official first day when you can officially start signing free agents and the nfl had to step in to see if they tampered but the dolphins got cleared of it though usually you would think this news would leak tomorrow during midnight but somehow already has been leaked more than a day before july
nba,not_removed,the year that noah won dpoy the nets were the seed in the playoffs andrew bynum started games and jordan crawford won a player of the week award hes done nets are done bynums done jordan crawford probably died like months ago and the knicks need to follow suit this teams only redeeming quality is the one and only first round draft pick of their team that they have on the roster fuck the knicks
nba,not_removed,thats assuming that the knicks wouldnt be stupid enough to offer noah million a year i dont have that much faith in them
nba,not_removed,yeah good short term basketball is perfect for the knicks right now nothing like being good enough to not get a good draft pick in one of the few seasons that we didnt trade our first round pick for the future rights to bryce dejeanjones or something like that but still being bad enough that we have little to no chance of advancing past the first round and if we advance past the second round it means that at least one eastern conference team lost most if not all of their players in a tragic boating accident and the world is too sad about that to care about the knicks making it to the conference finals where we will be swept in games by whatever team is still alive then and agreed with that last point because i quite love hornacek but to paraphrase chris rock do the knicks want a cookie if youre dumb enough to hire kurt rambis as your head coach in then you should just get relegated to the dleague and restart the seattle sonics or some shit idk
nba,not_removed,you give that same advice to the knicks front office in regards to putting together a respectable team
nba,not_removed,none whatsoever langston is the man i guess i forget about him because hes a respectable player and seems like a decent human being so its hard to associate him with the knicks
nba,not_removed,too true he is no where near the level he was at a few years ago when he was dpoy the injuries have taken its toll
nba,not_removed,i dont know the specifics but isnt this like of the salary cap id put down that money for joakim years ago but at this point id be tempted to try and throw the max at dwight rather than even offer mil for noah
nba,not_removed,altercations went at it
nba,not_removed,if it makes you feel any better noahs contract will take up the same portion of this years cap as rolos contract did last year
nba,not_removed,i dont doubt that bontemps of the washington post is a reputable source but the whole thing seems uncharacteristic of the fo to me the interest was probably handled through back channeling but to have an amount released a day before free agency officially begins just seems a bit fishy the knicks have often done the opposite of what they have insinuated withtold the media unless its woj beck or even begley the news has to be taken with a grain of salt
nba,not_removed,fuck the knicks geez are you a knicks fan or arent you joakim is definitely not done he played fine in before his shoulder injury his role became less significant when mirotic joined them d rose afflalo melo porzingis and noah doesnt sound too bad on paper
nba,not_removed,dude i love you this is too funny have an upvote
nba,not_removed,i dont agree but i upvoted cause youre pretty funny
nba,not_removed,the knicks dont make those stupid isiahesque moves anymore
nba,not_removed,not all hope is lost yet because we dont know the details of noahs contract cross your fingers that it will be year deal roses contract is an expiring so its just year for him dont get too worked up about their salary because youre not writing their checks
nba,not_removed,and the cap will rise again next summer
nba,not_removed,yes and no i am a fan of the new york knicks team i absolutely hate the ownership front office and of the coaching staff and roster and a large portion of the fanbase irl btw knicks fans on here are awesome yall are the opposite of raptor fans keep doing your collective thing so i guess i just like orange and blue triangles with a basketball in the middle or whatever and thats not a bad or awful team but thats assuming all players will be healthy and even then that team is a team that might make the second round of the playoffs in theyre lucky thats their ceiling and to waste million a year on a old joakim noah when your team has won about combined games over the past seventeen years is isiah thomas level moronic
nba,not_removed,d rose afflalo melo porzingis and noah doesnt sound too bad on paper a few years ago sure minus porzingis have we already forgotten what happened the last time a new york nba franchise assembled a superteam of guys on the downswing of their careers
nba,not_removed,well thank you your kindness is appreciated been a rough couple of days which when coupled with almost no sleep leads to absolutely zero filter or refinement from my thoughts to what i type
nba,not_removed,maybe not in the last months but history just tells me that means were due for a major one
nba,not_removed,lol i can understand the frustration its crazy the knicks can be so bad even with melo on the team maybe im biased because im a fan of noah and his passing and defensive ability but for him sounds much better than for rolo
nba,not_removed,i know this team is good im just being entertained by this guy ease up
nba,not_removed,buuttt at least youll make the playoffs youll get the taste of playoff basketball again which is sweet even in defeat
nba,not_removed,phil hasnt made a dumb signing yet go to sleep friday this will all be fine
nba,not_removed,rather sign mahinmi for half of that hell id rather kick the tires on hibbert for less than half that price and thats really not that crazy when you consider that melo has only made it past the first round twice in his career yeah hes talented and great and blah blah fucking blah but hes not good enough to be the best player on a real contender he never has been the one time that he made it past the first round as a denver nugget chauncey billups led the team in minutes per game regular season and playoffs not melo that probably doesnt mean shit but i dont have a lot of high hopes for any team where melo is clearly the best player
nba,not_removed,d rose is just hitting his prime i think the consensus opinion is that rose hit his peak in his mvp season and hasnt been the same player since his injuries and do you mean the team that had the most injury prone player ever because amare and noah are nothing alike im not suggesting the knicks are a finals contender but theyll do alright i was referring to the nets for the record i actually think the knicks could be decent this year porzingis is awesome
nba,not_removed,cmon man i know the knicks suck and everything but you dont have to treat us like kings fans
nba,not_removed,the knicks gave a contract to sasha vujacic who started games this game even if he wasnt paid jerome james money thats still a hilariously awful move that would make scott layden proud
nba,not_removed,isnt it pretty much guaranteed mahinmi is staying on the pacers they have bird rights and need a center as someone who has seen a ton of lakers games you do not want hibbert instead of noah
nba,not_removed,dont be so butt hurt
nba,not_removed,i meanhe wasnt horrible for us down the stretch there he was just a fill in guy we didnt sign him long term for a lot of money
nba,not_removed,not really the consensus is that hes been dealing with injuries since his mvp season and that those injuries have permanently robbed him of the ceiling we saw in his mvp season
nba,not_removed,he hit his peak because hes never ever going to win another mvp award that simple enough
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,very impressive timing embiid read him like a book
nba,not_removed,nurk got stuffed nothing i can say will change that
nba,not_removed,why isnt nurkic talking shit after that
nba,not_removed,bro thats nurkic if he tried that on jokic itd be an and
nba,not_removed,jokic has outplayed embiid this game anyway
nba,not_removed,cuz embiid doesnt speak serbian
nba,not_removed,read my comment above
nba,not_removed,he has a boner for nurkic too
nba,not_removed,jokic has needed double teams to handle embiid like the whole game lmfao
nba,not_removed,he was banned for saying nurkicembiid
nba,not_removed,maybe in the first quarter
nba,not_removed,nurkic is bosnian if youre to talk shit do your research
nba,not_removed,he got unbanned
nba,not_removed,thats a retarded thing to be banned for
nba,not_removed,to be fair about of bosnians speak serbian its one of essentially official languages in the country
nba,not_removed,and wiggins is canadian bogut australian adams a new zealander far as i know they all speak english
nba,not_removed,i know
nba,not_removed,he was banned because novelty accounts arent allowed on this sub and he is pretty much a jokicbased novelty account most of the time
nba,not_removed,he said something like nurkicembiid i know im a troll but fuck you definitely not banworthy but he was annoying af
nba,not_removed,hes back
nba,not_removed,while true still seems weird for op to say serbian instead of bosnian over of the bosnians consider bosnian to be their mother tongue as opposed to serbian i can wiki too
nba,not_removed,because the official language is english idiot
nba,not_removed,i have to be honest i have no idea what your point is
nba,not_removed,but that post wasnt even about jokic
nba,not_removed,because you have another serbian center and bosnia and serbia really arent that different at all you cant expect people to care enough about nurkic to find out which balkan ethnic group he comes from lol he wasnt even talking shit too
nba,not_removed,not in canada idiot
nba,not_removed,do your research
nba,not_removed,actually it is along with french
nba,not_removed,ok whats your point
nba,not_removed,what a jokic
nba,not_removed,melo see theyre all the same
nba,not_removed,natural shooting motion
nba,not_removed,i dont think its that bad a flop
nba,not_removed,thats a pretty clear foul though bumps into him nudges him with the elbowarm right before the slowmo starts of course he embellishes it what is he supposed to do
nba,not_removed,why are people hating for this lots of players try to sell bullshit contact especially on end of game shots
nba,not_removed,lol that really isnt that bad its possible he could have tripped or slipped blame the refs for calling it
nba,not_removed,theres contact made above the waist before this video does the slow motion zoom in shot honestly this is a joke
nba,not_removed,obviously flopping
nba,not_removed,that was quite the late whistle
nba,not_removed,zooms in on the feet but the realtime shows embiids hip hitting jokic on the backside or is it just me
nba,not_removed,fooled me
nba,not_removed,how dare he make a good successful attempt at the only play that gives his team a chance to win
nba,not_removed,fuck me the jokic hate is real
nba,not_removed,if this were harden or smart this thread would be filled with jokes but its jokic so its not that bad tbh
nba,not_removed,what ever works to win i guess
nba,not_removed,looked like he was going for a three but embiid was right behind him so he lost balance either that or he was just flopping lol
nba,not_removed,i mean almost everyone in the league flops on their when theyre down plus there was a bit of a bump before the slowmo
nba,not_removed,i was pissed but since we won im ok with this that was a smart play by jokic good for him
nba,not_removed,down with seconds left point play is the only way to have a chance i dont fault him for it fault the refs for actually calling that
nba,not_removed,the part at the end actually does make it look like embiid kicked his left foot
nba,not_removed,hmm i think jokic didnt give up on the play unlike kd on xmas day
nba,not_removed,thats a fuckin smart flop they down
nba,not_removed,melo nodded
nba,not_removed,not sure what you want from him down e i like how the zoomin starts right after the contact between embiid and jokic by the way
nba,not_removed,i dont think thats close to a bad flop
nba,not_removed,you gotta be jocing
nba,not_removed,the reggie miller rule states offensive players may not extend any part of their body into a legal defender in an effort to draw a defensive foul on this play the offensive player kicks his leg out toward the airbore defensive player who is clearly going to miss him to draw the contact while it is the defender who makes contact with the offensive players leg this is an offensive foul embiid was clearly not going to make contact with him but jokic kicks his feet backwards so while there was contact jokic initiated it by kicking his feet out which shouldve been an offensive foul on him
nba,not_removed,hell get a warning its all good
nba,not_removed,lost his balance then went for safely falling down
nba,not_removed,fuck no hes trying to win he stole the ball then embiid bummed him and jokić shot it the slow reply is after embiid bummed him
nba,not_removed,hes not flopping here his team is down by hes at the point line with a defender on his back if any of you have ever played basketball you would do the same thing that being said he did flop all game and on multiple occasions it was cuz he had gotten beat either on offense or defense i can respect someone who does it in this situation i cant for when it happens throughout the game on some bullshit
nba,not_removed,i cant really complain about the flop given the situation the ref that called that shit can go suck a fat one though
nba,not_removed,he got his foot kicked a teeny bit
nba,not_removed,when youre down with seconds its about the only choice ya got
nba,not_removed,what makes it bad for me is hes clearly already fallingflopping before any contact is made look at the forward lean he has before his foot gets maybe touched
nba,not_removed,it is worse in context because he was doing this all game
nba,not_removed,its not a flop its an offensive foul he shot a shot at an angle specifically to kick that foot out and draw contact offensive players cannot kick out of their space to make contact with a defender if hes leaning the other way its an offensive foul should be here
nba,not_removed,you ever seen a marcus smart thread
nba,not_removed,its because he got the call if refs hadnt given that im sure half the bashing wouldnt be done
nba,not_removed,i think the issue here is that there was no contact besides the one he created by kicked his feet backward you cant kick your feet out for a foul
nba,not_removed,part of it was that jokic had like pervious flops this game i dont blame him or the refs watching it live i thought he got pushed the league needs to enforce the penalties for intentionally deceiving the refs and if the players still keep doing it they the penalties should become more severe
nba,not_removed,because people dont like that hes playing really well right now
nba,not_removed,i hate all of them for doing that just being consistent
nba,not_removed,its not like if it had went in they wouldve given him the foul so its not a big deal let the kid stat pad
nba,not_removed,oh wait guys remember we cant throw refs under the bus now lebron and kd said so
nba,not_removed,he was doing this all game it was really embarrassing
nba,not_removed,looked like that from what im seeing too looks like embidd rested his elbow on jokics back for a second
nba,not_removed,nobody said that its a flop either way
nba,not_removed,tbh this might be a flagrant on embiid
nba,not_removed,actually jokic is the one who kicks he kicks his foot behind him into embiids shin
nba,not_removed,delete your account
nba,not_removed,i dont like how you misspelled joking with a c when his name is spelled with a k im actually sitting here getting really worked up over this why would you do this to me
nba,not_removed,ok but so what i mean havent you ever seen a player flop especialy when the game is on the line why is this such a big deal you won anyway
nba,not_removed,so you guys are upset at jokic because the refs made the wrong call
nba,not_removed,ayy hes back
nba,not_removed,i dont have anything to say about voat or any other wacky stuff like that i just wanted to clean my comment history have a great day and be excellent
nba,not_removed,there were several slow replays that show jokic basically jumping out on his own
nba,not_removed,mods can you please permanently ban this guy for some reason you periodically unban him and all he does when he gets back is turn every thread into a stupid joke every other comment is paging his presence hurts discussion and detracts from the sub by making things repetitive and predictable i get you dont want to be too harsh but theres plenty of evidence that hes a drain on things also as this comment thread and many others show hes a huge troll and shitposter
nba,not_removed,he actually did flop there the specific situation doesnt magically make it any less of a flop also nobody was on his back so im not sure what you were watching
nba,not_removed,what a bad mentality your ok with the players actively trying to trick the ref but the problem is when it works
nba,not_removed,he definitely sold it a bit
nba,not_removed,was that what it was i thought it was an arm grazing he kind of stuck his foot back into embiid
nba,not_removed,more importantly he kicked the foot out and specifically shot a shot that let him kick his foot into a defender who was not in his space its not only a flop thats an offensive foul
nba,not_removed,to be fair marcus smarts on a whole other level
nba,not_removed,smart actually cost his team a game with his flopping this year instead of playing the ball and fighting for a rebound he threw himself to the floor and gave up the game winning offensive rebound on a missed shot
nba,not_removed,so fans are hating jokic because the ref blew the whistle on the only logical thing jokic could attempt shouldnt you be hating the refs instead every single player would and should do the same as jokic did when down with seconds remaining
nba,not_removed,also because its against the precious embiid
nba,not_removed,lol oh come on
nba,not_removed,nobody said that
nba,not_removed,flair doesnt check out
nba,not_removed,at this point in the game embiid had times as many ft attempts i think he realized the refs werr whistle happy and decided on the when in rome route
nba,not_removed,dont be so mean i think a temp ban will do him fine worked for me
nba,not_removed,i dont think its that hard to understand people dont like floppers look at the shit guys like harden and get despite being great players and the shit smart gets every time he flops winning doesnt negate the fact that jokic was flopping all game and as with harden and its worse when a star player does it constantly moreso than if it was a role player like jameer nelson flopping
nba,not_removed,im pretty sure more people are annoyed at his flopping but are legitimately mad at the refs for calling this a foul flopping is sadly part of the game so i cant blame him for it the refs still fucked up and clearly didnt take into account that he kicked his feet back to try and draw a foul it shouldnt have been called for that reason not because he flopped edit fwiw no one is going to deny that the refs were terrible on both sides so i dont get why people are so pissed at us for complaining about them
nba,not_removed,no people are upset because he was flopping all game i was just explaining to people who thought there might have been a foul because of the small contact
nba,not_removed,pause at tell me hes not touching jokić
nba,not_removed,hell be banned again soon enough mods hate him about as much as we do lol
nba,not_removed,turn every thread into a stupid joke every jokic thread at most and how is he trollingshitposting most of his comments are either stats or his opinion let the man have a damn opinion people complaining about him are even more detracting from the sub by making things repetitive and predictable it looks to me like you are looking for reasons to be offended because the only chance youd see eg in full action is when you are looking at nuggets game threads or jokic posts stop whining
nba,not_removed,im a troll by giving my opinion
nba,not_removed,you do what you go to do to win obviously within limits like harming other people etc i also sort of blame the ref for falling for it too
nba,not_removed,theres no other option if he wants to win down four points with that much time left if the ref doesnt make such a shit call we dont have an issue
nba,not_removed,no youre putting words in my mouth im okay with it because it was the only realistic option he had to try and win the game whether it works or not has no influence on my opinion
nba,not_removed,an embarrassing level
nba,not_removed,no because this was only his last flop in a series of gamelong flops
nba,not_removed,no because i havent forgot about emannuel mudiays buzzer beater to sink the sixers last season
nba,not_removed,lots of people root against him because theyre annoyed with
nba,not_removed,ok so a select few morons said that but you get what hes sayingmostly everyone here agrees that it was the smart thing to do
nba,not_removed,when in rome force yourself to face plant on an airball
nba,not_removed,so know he was floping whole game how about you notice any of the bullshit calls your team got in this game or refs in general there were fouls in this game but i guess its easier to pick on a player like jokic even when your team won for every flop of jokic you can find in this gsme i can find a bullshit call that went your way or a non call that went your way or guess what a flop your players made you homer
nba,not_removed,then how about you sixer fans focus on that the whistle was tight on both ends we had fouls ourselves but come into our threads and see there aint nobody blaming it on embiid or ilyasova
nba,not_removed,when exactly did he flop when embiid shoved him after the whistle was blown when he did the only basketball play that made sense and attempted to draw contact when down four with three seconds left its not jokics fault that the refs called it i agree that it was weak but every single player in the league would have done the same its not up to them if the refs actually call it which is what i think you and your fellow fans should be upset at not jokic
nba,not_removed,are you talking about when jokic kicks his foot back into embiids leg or when embiids hand grazes his jersey im surprised jokic can even walk after that embiid like clobbered him
nba,not_removed,it doesnt matter if hes touching him or not jokic initiates the contact by kicking his feet out backwards it actually shouldve been an offensive foul on him your feet cant make contact with a defender in an unnatural moition or its an offensive foul its called the reggie miller rule
nba,not_removed,i dont have anything to say about voat or any other wacky stuff like that i just wanted to clean my comment history have a great day and be excellent
nba,not_removed,na youre annoying
nba,not_removed,its a smart play basketball is not simply a physical game
nba,not_removed,obviously youre ok with it half of hardens points come from this garbage
nba,not_removed,so its okay for players to try and trick refs but if the refs fall for it then they are the problem
nba,not_removed,flop is a very strong word there is an enormous difference between flopping and selling the contact this is the same thing that gets thrown around with harden alot even though he lou williams and many others are just good at selling contact i cant remember any examples of flops jokic did this game where there werent something that classifies as a foul involved id like you to prove me wrong because i havent seen anything other than the last play which is the only logical thing he could do
nba,not_removed,he flopped multiple times throughout the game and embiid fouled out thats why we complained
nba,not_removed,i dont know who the hell is i hadnt even seen jokic play yet this year just didnt have time ive wanted to and i was greatly disappointed that he was the flopping european instead of the tough european he played like he knew he had nothing for embiid so he just flopped the whole time trying to foul him out
nba,not_removed,dont be dull intentionally if the refs are whistle happy of course youre going to make an effort to sell fouls
nba,not_removed,we are focusing on the shit refs were complaining about jokic but were legit pissed at the refs i dont get how its this hard for you to understand lol it shouldnt be news to any nba fan that their refs are the worst of any major sport however i would consider nfl refs slightly worse if it were their fulltime job
nba,not_removed,jokić never kicked his feet out take off your homer glasses and appreciate a player that was doing everything in his power to win a basketball game
nba,not_removed,bull shit
nba,not_removed,i like jokić hes my favorite player i talk about him nothing wrong with that i talk about other stuff too
nba,not_removed,half of wades in the finals came from that garbage if you want to play it that way lol get out of here people are still beating the same dead horse about harden and fts jeez man
nba,not_removed,yes the players job is to win the refs job is to make sure the game is played fair taking the high road doesnt produce ws if the nba wanted to they could institute fines or some shit
nba,not_removed,yes if its in the rules its on the refs to call the game appropriately flopping is annoying but you cant fault jokic for trying to get a call and hit a when its his only play gotta be fair
nba,not_removed,if he wasnt flopping he was crying to the refs every time he fouled embiid he had a good game otherwise but he was so afraid of embiid and he carried on in such an unbecoming manner it was hard to respect him
nba,not_removed,he was flopping like a fish out of water all game its stupid because he is super talented but he was at it all game
nba,not_removed,he scored in minutes man
nba,not_removed,well i didnt see on your subreddit in super bolded letters shit refs i saw jokic flops and at the top super bolded i dont get how its this hard for you to understand lol
nba,not_removed,take off your homer glasses lmfao the irony i guess jokics natural shooting motion includes a foot flail in the opposite direction of the basket who knew
nba,not_removed,thats a fair viewpoint although i dont necessarily agree with the idea of calling the refs shit for falling for a trick if they make bad calls sure but faulting the ref for mistaking flailing for a foul seems like victim blaming i blame the league for flopping not the players or refs btw
nba,not_removed,ive asked this countless of times now bur can you show me an instance of jokic flopping other than the last play
nba,not_removed,would you care to show me examples i dont remember any i remember some nocalls on him where he reacts the way one is when being fouled the refs were horrible on both sides so not saying that one of us had a big advantage but there is a huge difference between an intentional fall by a player after little or no physical contact by an opposing player in order to draw a personal foul call by an official against the opponent and to sell contact that actually qualifies as a foul
nba,not_removed,i was disappointed in the flopping not his play
nba,not_removed,theres a difference between being annoyed and directing blame jokic causes frustration while the refs cause legitimate anger just because people are more vocal about how annoying jokics flops were does not mean they think that they were more impactful than the refs the refs were absolute shit with calls towards both sides again how the fuck dont you understand that
nba,not_removed,he got bumped
nba,not_removed,the refs arent the victims we are its the refs job not to be fooled thats what they get paid for to know the rules and to ensure they are followed correctly during the game the league definitely has some fault here but the refs dont get a pass especially not when it is such a prominent issue everybody and their grandma knows flopping is a problem it has to be one of the things theyre on watch for
nba,not_removed,i dont streamable but to your exact definition he tried to draw a charge earlier in the game that the refs did not call because it was a clear flop i dont dislike jokic the dude balls but i watched the whole game and came away with the impression that hes a flopper once again i cant show you specific examples but i watch a lot of sixers games and he stood out like i said still a baller though
nba,not_removed,i guess the salt in your words is making you sound uninteligeble
nba,not_removed,bumped when embiids arm grazes his jersey wow that was such a hard foul how can you call that a bump embiid basically tackled him
nba,not_removed,i think people are ignoring that the entire idea of flopping is to fool the ref each ref is watching people it simply isnt possible to keep eyes on everyone at once if the ref catches the tail end of an act and cant necessarily discern that it was a flop or an actual foul if they blow the whistle on a flop they are crucified if they dont blow and it was a foul then they are crucified its an impossible job and you dont make it easier by calling them the lowest form of human life for each and every single mistake
nba,not_removed,salt in my wounds we won dude im happy i just fucking hate seeing poorly officiated games there were fucking fouls in a game thats legitimately a terribly officiated game
nba,not_removed,nah thats just all the salt flowing from all of your orfaces particularly your ears
nba,not_removed,its embiids hip that bumped jokić
nba,not_removed,i never said we should crucify them for not catching flopping but the fault still remains on them yes its a tough job and yes a lot of times theres no easy solution in the heat of the moment but that said it is still their job should they get death threats for not catching flopping no should they undergo better training to identify flopping and make it a point of emphasis moreso than they already have absolutely
nba,not_removed,i like how the name of this thread is refs fuck up the final possesion oh wait
nba,not_removed,nice come back bro you must be a sixer fan
nba,not_removed,jesus dude give up embiid didnt foul him your boy just flopped and failed it happens do you think its weird that you seem to be the only one saying it wasnt a flop do you not notice that
nba,not_removed,i saw this
nba,not_removed,flopping is supposed to look like a legitimate foul how would you go about training them on how to recognize flops versus actual fouls its really easy to be able to ascertain what isnt a flop with an isometric view and instant replay something the refs dont get i feel like a lot of people are missing that these refs normally have the worst view on the court being that they are the shortest and only have sets of eyes to watch ten people
nba,not_removed,refs arent perfect and some flops are gonna get through but there are certainly ones that should have been called on the floor if a flopper exaggerates contact to draw a whistle it can certainly be hard to tell but how many times have we seen phantom fouls committed with no contact at all those are catchable even from the refs point of view if its a matter of eyes per player assign bigger crews to games and make more use of the reviewing process i realize these may not be super ideal situations but they would go a long way towards curbing flopping and once players stop getting away with it so frequently itll stop happening
nba,not_removed,the fact that is only in the league is insane this entire season is wacky
nba,not_removed,who is this it you speak of i know only of a goat that plays on the celtics
nba,not_removed,goatlet
nba,not_removed,this year is ridiculous for scoring
nba,not_removed,i didnt even know he was averaging close to a game damn its been scorching
nba,not_removed,hes like rudy but ya know actually good
nba,not_removed,fuck
nba,not_removed,i wonder what he could do with a few more inches
nba,not_removed,isaiah thomas would be the best point guard in the nba thats six fucking inches
nba,not_removed,this entire season might be a little wacky but man is it awesome there are so many different storylines to follow best season for a while
nba,not_removed,pace is up as well which helps but still amazing talent right now
nba,not_removed,dont worry demar will drop in the next game
nba,not_removed,get drafted top
nba,not_removed,rnocontext
nba,not_removed,while theres definitely some great individual play happening all around the league i cant help but feel like the only real storyline is warriorscavs the trilogy whos injured this time edition
nba,not_removed,and in the offseason people were saying this season would be boring
nba,not_removed,exactly this i love the nba
nba,not_removed,best season for storylines maybe but its a terrible season for actual basketball its a team race the whole way
nba,not_removed,harden
nba,not_removed,or maybe we get a injury free finals this year
nba,not_removed,the only other option is everyone is injured and the finals is a on battle between kay felder and pat mccaw
nba,not_removed,nah were gonna go full and have anderson varajao one on one with jr smith on a cold streak
nba,not_removed,damn it keeps getting more impressive
nba,not_removed,half his size and only two points away
nba,not_removed,the white arch with the words seattle is too damn low and the green feels too dark i prefer much more
nba,not_removed,nostalgia a lot of people hated them and thought the colors sucked
nba,not_removed,theyre kinda ugly
nba,not_removed,not bashing the thunder by any means just admiring these old jerseys
nba,not_removed,dude with no mercy on these seattle fans
nba,not_removed,wherehow are you watching old games
nba,not_removed,bruh save this for the thunder roast
nba,not_removed,got exactly this jersey a few weeks ago right before durant became not nice l
nba,not_removed,love these jerseys
nba,not_removed,i love these and the alternative ones yellow
nba,not_removed,those uniforms are horrible
nba,not_removed,have an authentic kemp jersey in my closet just wish i could wear it to a game
nba,not_removed,it probably is nostalgia but they do look really nice in this picture in all honesty though i cant remember how i felt about them as i was reasonably young at the time
nba,not_removed,wasnt meant to be offensive
nba,not_removed,well now oklahoma doesnt have him either and im happy about that
nba,not_removed,i started as just watching old melo games on youtube and then the supersonics v celtics game was on the playlist
nba,not_removed,httpsgooglidygdw
nba,not_removed,conley with on ts career high points
nba,not_removed,allstar in our hearts
nba,not_removed,chriss looked really good tonight very versatile player
nba,not_removed,never thought id have that much fun watching a grizzlies game zebos sportsmanship is admirable as well
nba,not_removed,for those of you wanting to make the playoffs it would be games in a row just like this
nba,not_removed,conley only played minutes too absolute beast the grizzlies might have actually been able to be a threat to the warriors in the playoffs if they spent the on pretty much anyone other than parsons
nba,not_removed,the only negative i can think of for this game is that mike blew a wide open layup that would have got him to points i mean zbo made dunks tonight it was amazing
nba,not_removed,i can taste that sweet sweet second pick already
nba,not_removed,grizzlies fell only short of tying their franchise record shouldve let troy daniels play more smh
nba,not_removed,still love you grizz good win for you guys the suns make me poop
nba,not_removed,whos ready to get destroyed on inside the nba
nba,not_removed,brandan wright stole the spotlight
nba,not_removed,i didnt watch the game but i see brandan wright got minutes in the box score so someone may want to fix that typo
nba,not_removed,mike fuck you im the real steph curry conley i had to clap for him at one point in the when he was making every heat check shot he threw at the rim what a beast
nba,not_removed,chill with the title man
nba,not_removed,conley taking a page from lillard and playing pissed
nba,not_removed,good game by our big players need to keep this attitude up and come for thy seed phoenix you guys were great gg
nba,not_removed,i cant fathom how tj only got shots
nba,not_removed,couldnt even win by scrubs
nba,not_removed,im so conflicted
nba,not_removed,chuck have mercy
nba,not_removed,dont worry well probably lose to the nets or something stupid
nba,not_removed,anyone have an inside the nba stream
nba,not_removed,uh
nba,not_removed,that suns stadium looked a little empty but i guess its monday on a regular season game
nba,not_removed,conley out of nowhere with those offensive numbers
nba,not_removed,things arent all bad we got the l booker gets his points and chriss plays well
nba,not_removed,conley just torched them dam
nba,not_removed,how can you not like conley
nba,not_removed,and thats after he started chucking trying for lol
nba,not_removed,the efficiency is what gets me thats a ridiculous ts even after he missed a few shots when he was trying to get a bigger career high in the quarter
nba,not_removed,he was probably well above ts before he started gunning for
nba,not_removed,athletic as hell and has pt range as a big man thats a high ceiling right there from the limited amount ive seen him play i think his main issues are really from fouling probably more earlier in the season and not a great bbiq yet
nba,not_removed,this was probably his best offensive game this year i wince every time he jumps feet in the air on an obvious pump fake though hell learn i guess
nba,not_removed,do u think he gets extended minutes here on out
nba,not_removed,yeah that goes out the window when hes matched up against blake griffin
nba,not_removed,exactly you hear that teams that might match up with grizzlies youve been warned i kid of course i know you meant your own team i will say from experience that sweeps arent so bad if you go in with zero expectations and your guys play their hearts out
nba,not_removed,nah man youd be playing the warriors so it would probably be worse
nba,not_removed,if parsons stays healthy and can give us ill die happy
nba,not_removed,eric gordon was down to us and the rockets that would have been dope
nba,not_removed,they should have went after barnes maybe he wanted the option role but theyre making the same money and hed have been amazing with memphis
nba,not_removed,says they still are granted well struggle against other teams but we happen to be a perfect matchup nightmare for the ws
nba,not_removed,commentators called it the oldest fast break in nba history 😂
nba,not_removed,shouldve let troy daniels play more smh the motto of our season
nba,not_removed,he got like six minutes at the end but the backups refused to pass to him
nba,not_removed,additionally excessive amounts of vitamin d can have adverse effects on your bowel movements
nba,not_removed,shaqtin a fool is just going to be our defensive highlights
nba,not_removed,i finished
nba,not_removed,i wish the mods would make a rule where the post game threads are just winning team record beats losing team record by a score of whatever
nba,not_removed,a career night deserves some recognition put some respec on his name
nba,not_removed,people keep saying tj doesnt look the same but honestly a big part of it is that hes just getting so many fewer chances than he did early in the year not sure why that is but it bums me out
nba,not_removed,lol we were up by nearly when the backups started playing minutes of garbage time
nba,not_removed,im not that fucking sucked if youre gonna tank lose by points not at least our losses as of late have been close but they chose the national tv game to play like shit
nba,not_removed,it was also a late game start time were not used to staying up late for sports like you east coasters
nba,not_removed,hes years old relax haha have you never been frustrated before hes perfectly fine
nba,not_removed,he missed three shots in a row chucking at the end
nba,not_removed,pretty much this hes still new to the game so he has to learn stuff that is second nature to others
nba,not_removed,he has been getting extended minutes for a rookie whos not that good for practically the entire season
nba,not_removed,wouldnt blame him
nba,not_removed,i remember a playoff series like that
nba,not_removed,agreed not writing off the contract just yet its a long term investment well just have to wait and see how he is after his minute restriction is lifted its disappointing but really and a well rounded game would be a godsend during the playoffs which could still absolutely happen
nba,not_removed,hindsight tho gordon has already played more games this season than he did last season
nba,not_removed,lets not pretend like the last piece of our contender puzzle wasnt resigning toney douglas parsons and wright be damned so long as we have toney with toney on roster we are with wins against the cavs and the warriors and dont try to tell me that the win against the cavs had something to do with them resting james kyrie and love it was douglas
nba,not_removed,you played against them
nba,not_removed,but then you dont get great titles like
nba,not_removed,they usually are but i think if theres a really noteworthy performance it should be listed this title was definitely overboard tho
nba,not_removed,nah i think the rcollegebasketball rule is boring
nba,not_removed,do you want another rnfl because thats how you get another rnfl
nba,not_removed,considering how raw a prospect he was hes been impressing me i thought he be playing similar to what thons been doing but hes showed some real potential ceiling is crazy high
nba,not_removed,something something spoons to a gunfight
nba,not_removed,absolutely isnt it also weird that the heat have gone to shit since they lost toney im recognizing a trend with that said troy daniels needs to play mpg minimum
nba,not_removed,mike conley with a career high points tacked on at the end would be fine but this is overkill lol
nba,not_removed,that still makes me so sad such an awesome coach hell i loved when hollins was there too every time you guys change i think the grit n grind will leavebut it always stays it always stays
nba,not_removed,preach brother
nba,not_removed,what hs did you play for thats dope
nba,not_removed,yeah i totally agree but ill happily take the outlier title gore if it means this sub retains its personality
nba,not_removed,ha cool no worries
nba,not_removed,wonder whose shoe people in australia gravitate towards delly or simmons
nba,not_removed,what does the shoe look like
nba,not_removed,so bizarre that delly has become a star mainly because hes on a good team
nba,not_removed,wear these to your local outback and get a free bloomin onion
nba,not_removed,lol the little kid near the end in the full cavaliers uniform with the leg sleeves as well
nba,not_removed,curry doesnt believe his eyes
nba,not_removed,holy swagger
nba,not_removed,cavaliers to seattle confirmed
nba,not_removed,whered they do this kickz
nba,not_removed,do people in china buy crazy pairs of peak lining and anta many marque players sign to these chinese brands and you hear or see marketing in the us plus theyre not even sold in the us i just wonder where the money comes from to sign players away from nike and adidas
nba,not_removed,yo i know those kids at
nba,not_removed,for now delly cause hes a champ in the future years probably simmons if he plays to his projection
nba,not_removed,simmons no one here likes or has heard of peak and their shoes dont look that good either its a really really obscure brand and a lot more people are gonna buy simmons shoes just for the fact that its nike
nba,not_removed,people dont go for names here its all about the nike and
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,they look like what a year old sonics fan and father of four would wear
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,delly became a star because he backs up a very fragile point guard on a top tier team finals first half of this year a lot of exposure w him as a starter
nba,not_removed,yeah man i went there today
nba,not_removed,yes and theyre relatively cheap you also see random dudes popping up in ads for the oddest shit sign a contract fly over to china for a week shoot some promos pick some colors get a giant red envelope and head back
nba,not_removed,personally i think delly the dude is just more relatable to us regular folk
nba,not_removed,didnt consider this factor nike does win the brand recognition factor here
nba,not_removed,just realized that ben simmons shoes would be called lol
nba,not_removed,is this the year
nba,not_removed,no one is wearing and lol there are a few getting around in the under armour but its mostly nike
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,delly curry shoe
nba,not_removed,calling him a star in college is a bit of a stretch he was really good but patty mills was a lot better than he was when he was in college and is a better pro its just weird to me that delly seems so much more popular than patty or even bogut
nba,not_removed,regulah cahnts
nba,not_removed,dude were talking about basketball shoes being sold in australia were lucky were not all wearing converse
nba,not_removed,i wear and
nba,not_removed,woof those are hideous
nba,not_removed,f he resigns with the cavs im buying them
nba,not_removed,haha i wasnt being serious obviously not a star yeh i was just thinking that patty is earning about mil while delly will sign anywhere from mil a year after his finals appearance last year his good season this year he has become more popular patty had a down year had played average in the postseason bogut is still quite popular and to me they feel almost equal simmons will gradually take over jingles is my favourite aussie player tbh
nba,not_removed,converse are still relevant is not
nba,not_removed,haha man you gotta get a real pair of ball shoes and were bad even when they were good
nba,not_removed,its the color way but peak definitely borrowed some of kobe or design elements here and there
nba,not_removed,theyre just kobe with peak branding colour way is average
nba,not_removed,thats just likeyoure opinion man
nba,not_removed,give these a swoosh and a kobe symbol and people pay for them
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,yea patty and delly seem pretty comparable but the main difference is probably delly being associated with lebron while patty is on the spurs and the kinda personal anonymity that comes with their team culture
nba,not_removed,you get my point im talking about out of date brands more or less
nba,not_removed,i dont know about all that these just look cheap as hell like the kinda shoes you mow the lawn in
nba,not_removed,the colour way is based around our national colours green and gold but yeah looks average
nba,not_removed,hey i know this meme
nba,not_removed,design cues not materials lol they mesh and foams does look cheap
nba,not_removed,im aussie also haha just doesnt look right though
nba,not_removed,mark titus was my favorite college basketball writer back with grantland biggest takeaway from the article for me is since the release of the curry lows on june steph currys world has been rocked to the core the basketball gods are punishing him for releasing the lamest shoes an nba mvp has ever put his name on and they show no signs of letting up soon
nba,not_removed,this will seem like just a butthurt warriors homer talking but playoff curry has also been very good at times i mean the writer doesnt seem to want to portray curry as a choke artist but its still a bit of a backhanded compliment playoffs stats shooting ts bpm its not like hes that much worse those are better numbers than his regular season
nba,not_removed,i really want to see him transfer that regular season play into the finals
nba,not_removed,watching steph play last season was spectacular criticism from last years finalsplayoff performance may hinder the success from the regular season but despite the criticism for being named the first unanimous mvp he was still the consensus front runner from the start he led the league in scoring at shot in the process and accomplished this in a efficient manner averaging fga in minutes of play he had the highest per at for a guard since with jordans regular seasoned curry is the most entertaining athlete in sports from not only how productive he is statistically but by how accessible he makes it look of course there is intense training and a strict regime behind the course of his success but like the article stated i want him to be so amazing that we all pretend like hes some perennial underdog and not a college all american who was a top draft pick and is the son of a former nba player stephen curry plays a style of basketball attainable to the common individual with his small frame and lack of athleticism he inspires us to shoot no matter how far or the difficult the distance may be and makes the most impossible shots a reality this was a great article and im curious to see how the warriors will move forward this season with the acquisition of durant will the offense still be centered around currys gravitational pull or will we see an offense tailored to durants strengths
nba,not_removed,great article
nba,not_removed,one of the best regular season performers of all time he needs to elevate his game in the playoffs consistently
nba,not_removed,i find it hilarious how you have to say regular season now
nba,not_removed,well thats all hes good for the regular season
nba,not_removed,they shouldnt be allowed to exist in greyonwhite and a few other color schemes but they really that said under armour will always be less cool than nike adidas is cooler too but nike is tops and dont see anyone changing that
nba,not_removed,steph curry regular season goat
nba,not_removed,the rule change around jordanruling curry is going to help im not sure anyone can legit defend him for a whole offensive possession without grabbing and before anyone says illegal screens that isnt near the benefit that the grabbing provides to defenders
nba,not_removed,same here his first one wasnt too bad his second one ill give him a pass on
nba,not_removed,you didnt read the article
nba,not_removed,they throw even more defenders on him in the playoffs and the refs allow more physicality which hurts players like curry more than the bigger guys imo and curry generally doesnt play as well too lol
nba,not_removed,and that one postseason that ended in him getting a championship ring
nba,not_removed,nah theyre bad
nba,not_removed,what rule change
nba,not_removed,lol hahahaha this is too amusing you pussies crying about grabbing when that shit happens to every player oh and your team kicks people in the balls and yes illegal screens are more advantageous than barely touching your sweet princess
nba,not_removed,aint nothing new this shit happens to everyone in the playoffs he should be happy he doesnt get hit with hard flagrants like lebron has gotten in almost every playoffs curry is barely getting touched and you guys acting like someone murdered him
nba,not_removed,anyone can beat an injured team to win a ring just ask the cavs
nba,not_removed,its not a rule change theyre just making it a point of reference to focus on offball foul calls
nba,not_removed,you have a weak definition of legit defense that defense was extremely situationalnot ideal defense for of a normal game yes love did a great job when he was giving curry a massive lane to the basket in a late game situation where he knew all curry could do was shoot a youre asking to get torched defending curry like that normally
nba,not_removed,do you only comment on currywarrior threads if you dislike them so much why bother
nba,not_removed,its not healthy to carry this much hate towards a player and organization
nba,not_removed,youre in for a long season brah
nba,not_removed,seriously arent we done with this we lost and its been like months can we move on
nba,not_removed,i dont down vote stupid
nba,not_removed,youre right lets just discount both teams rings and then every other ring that stemmed from some semblance of luck you know what lets just end competitive sports
nba,not_removed,i feel like they always have some new point of focus before the season and then you dont really see that much on it
nba,not_removed,lol literally of his post history is talking shit on curry and the warriors just looking at the first page he has a post saying curry isnt a top overall player in the nba si just ranked deandre jordan in the league deandre curry confirmed
nba,not_removed,dude has to suffer for the whole season hes actually crying inside
nba,not_removed,he said all time if you actually look at the context of his post
nba,not_removed,you dont think the best shooter ever played in nba is not top
nba,not_removed,funny but wrong sub
nba,not_removed,wrong sub
nba,not_removed,i upvoted you this is better than the steady stream of shitposts
nba,not_removed,haha thanks its been removed already anyway
nba,not_removed,these guys are millionaires and cant be bothered to drop bucks for an uber
nba,not_removed,i have so many questions about this
nba,not_removed,so will this help us sign him
nba,not_removed,the mugshot
nba,not_removed,freekcp
nba,not_removed,what the hell didnt this dude just play in a basketball game two hours ago and hes already drunk an hour later
nba,not_removed,is literally like one beer haha
nba,not_removed,id understand if he lost to the nets ok not really but they won tho
nba,not_removed,is he losing the max
nba,not_removed,shouldve stayed humble
nba,not_removed,hell be freed in less than hours whether he deserves to be or not
nba,not_removed,they buy really nice cars and they like to drive them
nba,not_removed,na keep him locked up dd is serious
nba,not_removed,he was arrested early wednesday morning
nba,not_removed,wednesday morning
nba,not_removed,barely
nba,not_removed,hes already free
nba,not_removed,why doesnt he deserve to be free he hasnt been convicted yet there is a reason why we dont arrest people up and allow the copspolice station act as the judge and jury as well
nba,not_removed,seriously there should be just straight up zero tolerance for it first offense your license is gone and youll have to wait years to reapply sounds harsh but people who have bad enough judgement to operate what are essentially pound death machines when drunk or high should not be able to be in that opportunity for a long ass time selfish pricks cant even bother getting an uber or taxi its drunk drivers and just terrible drivers altogether that give me an insane level of anxiety with driving especially since im aware how fucking horrible of a driver i am and i dont wanna negatively impact someone elses life due to it
nba,not_removed,i mean he was literally right at a its not like he was blackout herestill not good but this should be treated differently than michael floyd or something
nba,not_removed,that makes alot more sense
nba,not_removed,o well fuck me right
nba,not_removed,its a catch though i got a dui for having nanograms of thc in my system thats nothing a standard piss test only tests and up is just left over traces from a multiple week period of not smoking should i have all that for having the tiniest bit in my system when i hadnt smoked in weeks i was completely sober for my dui i agree we need to work it but we also need to judge it case by case especially after the ridiculous mandatory minimums on drug offenses in the mandatory minimums are not the answer each case is different and should be treated as such especially when smoking a plant three weeks prior can get you a dui while sober
nba,not_removed,that is crazy sorry man why were they even able to drug test you
nba,not_removed,exactly is the lowest percentage and its basically one drink so i dont think thats a big dealespecially after that loss they had at the buzzer that basically ended their season
nba,not_removed,they said i failed field sobriety test i blew a and they failed me because it was degrees at and i was still in shorts from when it was warm during day i struggled on the one legged stand from shivering they tested me min later at hospital and i passed the field sobriety with flying colors inside but they still took my blood and gave me a dui cause i smoked weeks ago first is just a ticket in wi and i know ill never get another cause i dont drink and drive but it still took numerous job options away from me they need to develop a saliva test that has a hour window to show positive its insane to get a dui for tiny amounts of weed on your system for weeks or make a reasonable cut off for nanograms so you cant get a dui if you clearly have not smoked in a while
nba,not_removed,yeah fuck you rnba
nba,not_removed,superstar nba player does what he does best and team wins what incredible news
nba,not_removed,wow thats actually incredibly impressive
nba,not_removed,thats the only efficiency stat i need
nba,not_removed,it sucks not being able to get the benefit of the doubt sometimes
nba,not_removed,kinda of believe him if you look at the clip austin never saw the ref he was looking to see if his layup was going to fall
nba,not_removed,eh really weak tech league should rescind it atleast clippers werent winning this game anyways
nba,not_removed,i thought he was turning around just missed him and gave him a little whoops didnt see you tap like my bad type of thing thats how it originally looked to me
nba,not_removed,the refs and the rockets colours were pretty similar too i thought that was interesting
nba,not_removed,if that is true it is unfortunate but still absolutely necessary that the league remains consistent on this looking at the clip austin nudging the ref with his entire forearm seemed a bit egregious if you were the ref
nba,not_removed,did he get immediate ejection from touching the ref
nba,not_removed,but theres always a referee in that corner
nba,not_removed,thats horseshit you saw him you touched him you got ejected you were mad that the rockets were taking you apart and you did a stupid thing stop acting like a year old and own it
nba,not_removed,he stopped looking right at the ref then shoved the ref off as he started up the other way sorry austin but watching doc all your life has basically programmed a hatred for refs deep into your soul
nba,not_removed,thats a joke he was looking and talking to the ref when he put his arm on the ref
nba,not_removed,yeah like doc ever gives a ref the benefit of the doubt
nba,not_removed,i dont know it kind of looks like austin looks directly at the ref then gives him a small shove
nba,not_removed,the ref is pretty much always standing in that spot though
nba,not_removed,yes
nba,not_removed,just like phoenix take you apart yesterday
nba,not_removed,yeah because in china there arent any bad consequences for breaking rules
nba,not_removed,what video did you watch because rivers wasnt looking at the ref and he certainly wasnt talking to him when he made contact
nba,not_removed,if theyre targeting austin just because of doc then thats really shitty of them ive never seen him do anything that warrants a bad reputation
nba,not_removed,thats not doc though
nba,not_removed,yeah its definitely intentional weak but intentional
nba,not_removed,oh damn then yeah that sucks knee jerk move as much as i hate the clips i could understand if he got a technical foul for it and it was his tech of the game but instaejection seems too much did the ref sneak up to him or something dont they usually have a ref stand at the baseline right on that spot
nba,not_removed,it looked like rivers could have very well been looking at the ref before the shove but yeah he definitely didnt say anything to him
nba,not_removed,he definitely was looking at him i assumed he said something because he thought he got fouled
nba,not_removed,they arent targeting docs son its more that docs son probably has a deeplyingrained disrespect for refs from docs actions
nba,not_removed,ref was there the whole time austin did trip slightly but then he stopped looked right at the ref and then brushed the ref aside with his arm as he started running back up the court
nba,not_removed,the replay that was floating around was also in slow mo in real time he turns and almost simultaneously puts his arm at with a small bump against a gray short sleeve jersey aka the same one the rockets are wearing
nba,not_removed,admittedly i dont know if i can be completely objective but its very believable that he didnt know it was the ref he was in the corner of his eye and the rockets jerseys were the same color as the refs
nba,not_removed,you know what happens when you assume
nba,not_removed,if you look at the clip again it looks like he was ready to apologize before getting hit with the tech
nba,not_removed,thats a very good point
nba,not_removed,you could be right although i do think he saw him he did that turn around after he pushed off from him so it want like he didnt see him
nba,not_removed,refs literally didnt trust the process
nba,not_removed,because he dribbled
nba,not_removed,he has a subtle dribble after getting the ball the second time on the replay you can see he only takes two steps before dunking
nba,not_removed,i dunno nick medrud
nba,not_removed,you cant really see it but he bounced the ball once
nba,not_removed,i think i see it now at first it looked like he just ran with it
nba,not_removed,oh no ive been exposed do i know you
nba,not_removed,you linked to your personal youtube account id delete the post
nba,not_removed,i feel like people drastically overestimate how hard it is to get into the basketball hof
nba,not_removed,was scottie pippen a hofer after the second championship
nba,not_removed,everybody gets into the hall of fame dont stress it
nba,not_removed,dude looks like squidwards house of course he is
nba,not_removed,thompson might be the best shooter in nba history and is really really fucking good on defense yeah id say hes gonna do it
nba,not_removed,hes
nba,not_removed,id gamble on all three of the warriors stars getting into the hall someday constant exposure success accolades allnba honors will go a long way in getting votes
nba,not_removed,quick somebody cue the curb your enthusiam theme song i really enjoyed reading this stream of consciousness post i feel like you would be a fun guy to be around
nba,not_removed,way too soon to say
nba,not_removed,tbh didnt read but imo yes curry is breaking all these records for shooting but klay is right behind him at this pace hell be the best shooter of all time hes clutch plays excellent defense and is the ideal teammate even if its if he retired after the finalsstill broke records went back to back wins saved their season and imo will win finals mvp if he keeps it up worse players are in it i dont really like the warriors mainly just dray but i can see how special curry has been dont let it overshadow what klay is doing though
nba,not_removed,no but he will be a hall of famer no player is a lock after just seasons simply because its only been season
nba,not_removed,the james worthy hall of fame
nba,not_removed,people are calling hof wayy too early you need tp do damage in the league for years in the league to be a hof
nba,not_removed,given his accomplishments to date and assuming he wins this year again id say no hes had basically great years set a few point records along the way and had some unbelievable offense i wouldnt think hes a lock for the hall of fame after this year if he kept up his level of play for another then his chances rise a lot but as he stands no
nba,not_removed,no maybe if he continues on this pace for like more years and the warriors win another ring
nba,not_removed,the fact that is a legit conversation just proves how fucking shit the basketball hof is so weak
nba,not_removed,i mean its essentially a lock at this point if klay plays even three or four more years like this hell be in the top ten amongst three point shooters of all time without a doubt
nba,not_removed,even if they get swept and lose each game by klay is in the hof
nba,not_removed,hell be a hall of famer by the start of next season if we win championships barring disaster an olympic gold some totally insane moments people will talk about for years i mean if we were handicapping finals mvp assuming ws win its not that unreasonable to think klay might get super hot in two games and get it id say we are curry klay lebron still doubt anyone wants to give the loser the fmvp because having west as the only one kind of means something historically iggy even if he repeats his performance last year might be resistance to give back to back fmvps green would need at least triple doubles
nba,not_removed,seriously if your a potential candidate just dont fuck it up
nba,not_removed,they seriously do they think that a player needs to win an mvp win a few championships as the best player on the team and make at least ten allnba teams to even be considered if thompson stays on this current pace even if he doesnt improve at all hes making it no question hell by august he might have two nba championships and an olympic gold that right there puts him close edit like people seriously question whether or not vince carter deserves to be in the hall of fame dude will end his career top in points allstar allnba with an olympic gold and prime averages of as well as the cultural impact that he made on the game with his dunking
nba,not_removed,i mean he had an argument not a very good one but he had one
nba,not_removed,he was technically due to the olympic squad
nba,not_removed,and klay is no scottie pippenyet
nba,not_removed,apparently on reddit it doesnt take much maybe i can make it
nba,not_removed,peoples opinions of klay are biased because of curry without curry klay is breaking all of the three point records hes a large part of the reason the game is changing that combined with good defence and two rings yeah probably hof worthy
nba,not_removed,and in his nba season
nba,not_removed,harrison barnes would be happy to know hes thought of so highly
nba,not_removed,drazen petrovic didnt
nba,not_removed,stop posting this shit in every thread
nba,not_removed,lebron
nba,not_removed,you mean just dont pete rose it
nba,not_removed,bosh has about or more all star seasons than pippen did in
nba,not_removed,im already in
nba,not_removed,hes a euro legend tho they take that into consideration theres hall of famers that never played in the nba
nba,not_removed,youre not wrong memes didnt die for this
nba,not_removed,big if true has to be the beaten down joke in a while im sorry i couldnt take it anymore
nba,not_removed,yeah alltime leading scorer for the raptors as well gold medal in olympics as well
nba,not_removed,🎷🎷🎷🎷
nba,not_removed,what on earth is going on
nba,not_removed,i want hayward
nba,not_removed,sweet sweet music to my ears good to see lyles getting his mojo back
nba,not_removed,george hill has a quiet night but still has the best gobert is a god damn monster
nba,not_removed,did the team with the better record lose every game tonight
nba,not_removed,a simple graph showing the most number of fgs made by a single player in the nba from the year they introduced the point line the season through the previous season for the two lockout shortened seasons i normalized the fg shots per an game season whats interesting here is that you can see the pt fg shot has become more used over time you can see the spike in the when they shortened the arc you can see the curry effect in the past couple of years yowza
nba,not_removed,dennis scott effect
nba,not_removed,fuckin george mccloud
nba,not_removed,itll get removed anyway edit maybe not
nba,not_removed,dont worry guys the league will give him a flop warning
nba,not_removed,try to look away from my flair when you read this do you guys expect him not to attempt to draw the contact when down four he didnt deserve the call but to rage over him attempting to draw the foul is odd to me as every single player in the league would and should do the same what else is a player supposed to do down that late every player throws up a shot and makes it look like they were fouled its not his fault that the refs called it who btw made some horrible calls both ways both in form of nocalls and other calls
nba,not_removed,it didnt look like he flopped to me
nba,not_removed,you mean the one that gave us the only chance to tie the game
nba,not_removed,i get what youre saying but its just kind of a weak way to try and draw contact he wasnt getting jumped into he just brushed his leg against someone behind him and flopped like crazy
nba,not_removed,its just the anticirclejerk in effect people flop like this all the time to try and draw fouls not that i condone it but you dont see after every one quite frankly im quite proud that we have a player good enough to have an anticirclejerk
nba,not_removed,he flopped harder than a jello spill
nba,not_removed,yea the flop
nba,not_removed,yes that flop there were several in the game so its nice to narrow down which one were specifically talking about
nba,not_removed,wut
nba,not_removed,well first of all embiid did in fact move towards him i agree that it was a weak call but are philly fans hating him right now because he didnt draw it good enough or that he drew it poorly but the refs called it you know very well that if down and with three second left every single player on your team and the league would do the same if the refs calls it or not arent up to them but its the only good basketball play
nba,not_removed,the anticirclejerk isnt because hes good lmao chill with that its because a singular person has been obnoxiously inserting this player into any conversation about young players for the last year and a half and people are sick of it
nba,not_removed,embiid moved toward him in such a small way though but youre right its not on him that the refs called it and tons of other players would try something similar in that situation like it or not its just part of the game so yeah i guess why not do it doesnt mean we cant call it a flop though
nba,not_removed,how is he not good what are you smoking he was banned for the last six months and hes not even posting as much as he used to stop whining
nba,not_removed,nah last few games jokic has been getting a lot of complimentary comments around here eg hasnt even really been that active lately i mean whatever helps you sleep at night but just search jokic and sort by new check out the threads especially after the two almost triple double games that jokic had
nba,not_removed,the thing i think its wrong here is that instead of the jokes that would be made if it was lebron kyrie or any other star in the league jokic is ridiculed and hated by fans even though it is the only play that allowed us to have any chance of winning
nba,not_removed,i mean you cant get caught up in what one particular fan base thinks if lebron or kyrie pulled this you bet your ass warriors fans would be shitting all over it youve swayed me on it though in that situation and given how many players do this and get the call this is absolutely the right move dont worry about what sixers fans think
nba,not_removed,i wont its probably just some anger poured at the wrong guy
nba,not_removed,dont do that to yourself bro just move on
nba,not_removed,swaggy p with the swaggy plea
nba,not_removed,his manner of speaking is swaggy personified
nba,not_removed,squat teams lmao
nba,not_removed,i feel like nobody here knows whats happening to chris brown lol
nba,not_removed,i love swaggy p
nba,not_removed,i wish i could understand what he was saying
nba,not_removed,i wish he were better at basketball he seems pretty fun and nice thats why our fan base loved him that first year
nba,not_removed,really cant stand him hope lakers buy out his contract so he can go have fun on social media elsewhere
nba,not_removed,nick young acting like his crib the bando boy sit down lol
nba,not_removed,yeah ive only seen old people who talk like that
nba,not_removed,not a clue lol just saw hella memes on twitter thats bout it
nba,not_removed,well trade you our swag for your beard
nba,not_removed,hes saying chris brown get your shit together this rich neighborhood we live in barely wants black dudes here and you making us all look bad so move please
nba,not_removed,woman runs out of chris browns house calling the cops saying that he threatened her with a gun cops show up asking to search cbs house cb says not without a warrant cops wait in front of cbs house until swat shows up or warrant or something they look for gun dont know what happened after that source google
nba,not_removed,who says no
nba,not_removed,although youre right he was joking lol
nba,not_removed,he threw a duffel bag with drugs and a gun out his window im not kidding
nba,not_removed,a judge legit signed a warrant based on some she said shit
nba,not_removed,arent you allowed to have guns in the us though they cant prove that he threatened the woman unless there was security footage or something the worst that happens is he gets some drug charges and is bailed out and put in rehab or something
nba,not_removed,well when the accused person is already convicted felon
nba,not_removed,you cant own a gun if youre a domestic abuser
nba,not_removed,damn hes in some deep shit now
nba,not_removed,okc got a few calls on that mini comeback at the end
nba,not_removed,bogut style
nba,not_removed,doesnt matter anymore
nba,not_removed,tweet video streamable mirror sending a pm for conversion is temporarily unavailable its been bugged and im just getting around to fixing it should be back up within a few days bugsfeedbacksuggestions send me a pm
nba,not_removed,coach did you have any sugar during halftime
nba,not_removed,easy there horny
nba,not_removed,so thats what he meant by super team
nba,not_removed,hell fit right in here in new york
nba,not_removed,rose was just incorporating the knicks offensive principles into everyday life he understands the triangle needs three points actually though i have no idea why this three some thing is significant
nba,not_removed,this is such a bullshit title it has nothing to do with the night at hand just yeah i wanted to have a threesome on a random night and she refused nothing violent or forceful happened that night totally separate nights if anything it helps him because it shows he can handle being told no
nba,not_removed,wow the post completely misrepresents the testimony
nba,not_removed,aint no fun if the homies cant have none
nba,not_removed,here come the trolls i can already taste the sharks attacking rose at any chance even if the post is completely misconstrued
nba,not_removed,he was learnig the triangle offense before joining the knicks such a student of the game
nba,not_removed,thats less salacious than it is boring
nba,not_removed,must be hard out there if you have to share
nba,not_removed,cause hes been accused of essentially gang raping the girl
nba,not_removed,that doesnt fit this context
nba,not_removed,nurk has become one of the most loved blazers in like games
nba,not_removed,summer time broken watches hot girlfriends double doubles dreamy beards damn nurks got a pretty cool life
nba,not_removed,nurkic just completely turned back the season for the blazers

nba,not_removed,god i fucking wish raps got nurkic
nba,not_removed,nurkic was what jv was suppose to be

nba,not_removed,so what was his issue in denver again he seems to like it over in portland or something
nba,not_removed,i was at the game tonight and the crowd including myself went crazy any time he touched the ball great team effort tonight refs were ass though
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,is like games wot
nba,not_removed,i hate this guy dude he destroyed us twice but tbh u guys have a really great center now hope ur can fuck kd in the playoffs
nba,not_removed,summer time is for nuggets not for him
nba,not_removed,i thought he was getting at that it was lillard time
nba,not_removed,big change from locker room supposedly having issues like calling out ezeli
nba,not_removed,more life
nba,not_removed,our dance girls are thick tho leading the league in muffin tops per game
nba,not_removed,just the one
nba,not_removed,oh yeah i forgot it tried to take that while lillard was pretending to be human
nba,not_removed,but if you traded for nurk then you would have also needed toaccept dens round pick lol
nba,not_removed,and alex len
nba,not_removed,he wasnt fine with coming off the bench to jokic fair enough hes a very good player
nba,not_removed,holy shit nice username

nba,not_removed,whos their gm he needs a raise
nba,not_removed,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍
nba,not_removed,oh ok thanks i thought he was the starter
nba,not_removed,i like girls who will sleep with me
nba,not_removed,nah
nba,not_removed,lillard did it first though it is still amazing but cmon he cant take lillards thing
nba,not_removed,he was to start the year off but jokic simply out played him and earned the spot the problem was having two starter caliber centers who cant play very well together
nba,not_removed,so you dont like any girls
nba,not_removed,bah gawd
nba,not_removed,wew
nba,not_removed,hits too close to home
nba,not_removed,mostly just because of less players per team for the big nhl just doesnt have the revenue that the others do mls is mls
nba,not_removed,basketball everything else edit i mean the game itself haha
nba,not_removed,was just discussing this in another thread and thought it was an interesting topic
nba,not_removed,less players more
nba,not_removed,mls so close to on the graph lmao
nba,not_removed,of course mls is last
nba,not_removed,damn nhl players getting skeeved mil for the highest paid player
nba,not_removed,thats interesting that the highest paid mlb player isnt that much more than lebrons salary in a sport without a salary cap
nba,not_removed,encourage your kids to play basketball ladies and gentlemen
nba,not_removed,mls is a major sports league now
nba,not_removed,i wish everyone wouldnt assume this is the reason it has more to do with the cba compared to other leagues than anything else the nfl could afford to pay their players more but they dont because they didnt bargain as well
nba,not_removed,average is only so high because nba teams on average have less players than an mlb or an nfl team
nba,not_removed,yeah i was actually surprised when i first heard this in fact the salaries for each league were nearly the opposite of my general assumptions
nba,not_removed,the phrase you are looking for is ball is life
nba,not_removed,only in america
nba,not_removed,were you expecting something different
nba,not_removed,hard cap more players and while still raking in billion in revenue a year its still not as popular as the other big
nba,not_removed,for a man roster using nba player averages with current caps its because of the number of players that is the reason with the setup
nba,not_removed,nah it actually has more to do with the limits on superstar contracts and better collective bargaining than other leagues teams end up overpaying mediocre players because the cba requires they payout to player salaries check out this article
nba,not_removed,its not very surprising there are way few players to pay in the nba compared to other leagues
nba,not_removed,yep
nba,not_removed,nope just pointing it out really im a big soccer fan so i wish it were big here
nba,not_removed,there are still only about more players per team guys like crosby are the king are making more than half as less as guys like lebron or harden its insane nhl players need a better union theyre getting ripped isnt it only not that popular in the us still massively popular in canada
nba,not_removed,yes but where did the come from its the cba not the number of players causing this statistic the nfl bring in way more revenue and could easily pay its players more if the nflpa had bargained better they would be end of story
nba,not_removed,even if you didnt limit the upward bound on the player salaries for stars the average per player salary would remain unchanged because the player pool is the same size and so is the revenue if you increased roster size to per team and the revenue remained the same average salaries would go down the amount of players drawing from the pot is crucial
nba,not_removed,soft cap and all the rules that allow teams to go over it is the actual reason why
nba,not_removed,proof httpimgurcomahhuwj reference amacher r pate j microeconomics principles and policies retrieved from httpscontentashfordedu
nba,not_removed,this isnt why it has more to do with better collective bargaining by the players union than other leagues
nba,not_removed,nhl players are not really getting ripped off hockey in the us has the least viewers of the big least revenue and more players than the nba
nba,not_removed,nfl only makes the revenue that the nba does per franchise they would have to pay their players on average more to match the nba its definitely because of the roster size when each franchise in the nfl takes in in revenue they cant afford in salaries per year lol
nba,not_removed,nba players as a whole only get a couple more of total revenue than nfl players roster size plays a huge factor
nba,not_removed,proof httpimgurcomahhuwj reference amacher r pate j microeconomics principles and policies retrieved from httpscontentashfordedu
nba,not_removed,not true at all mlb teams dont have a cap
nba,not_removed,with a hard cap theyre definitely getting ripped they have a mil cap and no one in the league makes even close to mil guys like crosby and king are definitely getting skeeved the average revenue from an nhl team is about million dollars yet most teams only spend about mil on the players compared to the nba whos average team revenue is mil dollars and the average nba team payroll is about million dollars
nba,not_removed,you are missing the point no other league has a cba that requires a whopping to be spent on player salaries so it doesnt matter that they only make the revenue because they currently only use a much smaller percentage of that revenue on player salaries if they increased it to like the nba and you take into account the fact that they make double the revenue they could easily pay a higher average than the nba just because people think im wrong and downvote me doesnt mean its false we literally had to learn this scenario in a recent college class i took this was the real world example they used and just like everyone here when we first started learning it the assumption by everyone was that it had to do with roster size but it isnt its collective bargaining edit proof httpimgurcomahhuwj reference amacher r pate j microeconomics principles and policies retrieved from httpscontentashfordedu
nba,not_removed,proof httpimgurcomahhuwj reference amacher r pate j microeconomics principles and policies retrieved from httpscontentashfordedu
nba,not_removed,nothing in that had anything to do with what i said bargaining obviously plays a role in what percentage of bri the players get but the limits on superstar contracts dont change the overall mean salary of players in the league and the players also bargain over how many players are allowed on team rosters more players on the payroll would lower the average pay nothing you say changes that
nba,not_removed,they also have quite a lot more players on each roster some players also have mil contracts
nba,not_removed,do you consider much smaller than
nba,not_removed,obviously more players lowers the average but the point remains that the average exists in its current form because of the cba and it is evident that the nfl could afford to pay their players more on average even with the larger rosters if they had a more playerfriendly cba so in the end the reason the nba has the highest salaries isnt due to roster size its due to the cba end of story
nba,not_removed,they also have quite a lot more players on each roster yeah that is my point
nba,not_removed,its due to both edit nfl players take a cut of total revenues if you think that is dramatically different than and is the biggest reason why nfl players make as much on average as nba players i dont think you can be helped
nba,not_removed,your point doesnt explain why players can still earn mil though its soft cap rules that allow for teams to go over it
nba,not_removed,because more games more money
nba,not_removed,gg boston the marathon is not over though yall better get some cushion before mozgod hit his prime
nba,not_removed,isaiah thomas
nba,not_removed,rip
nba,not_removed,darkest times
nba,not_removed,end of an era honestly im surprised it took them this long with how long the lakers have tanked year head start idk
nba,not_removed,we have forsaken our ancestors
nba,not_removed,took you guys long enough stay good for another years so we can meet in the finals lebron should be retired by then
nba,not_removed,lakers can bounce back in years
nba,not_removed,thats insane how the celtics have to play the team that hold the record in order to break the record you cant write that shit edit nvm theres games in between now and then lol
nba,not_removed,is
nba,not_removed,brightest times
nba,not_removed,celtics were stuck in mediocrity for years after the bird era
nba,not_removed,what makes you think that celtics are competing and rebuilding at the same damn time
nba,not_removed,the
nba,not_removed,im with you on this one and im a laker fan it still boggles my mind that the celtics are in the east and theyre going to get the top pick in this stacked draft insane job by their fo im just hoping our core will develop
nba,not_removed,tits

nba,not_removed,question for demar was this one of the more satisfying nights for you kyle lowry in background no its not i wasnt out there with him best part of this interview lol 😂

nba,not_removed,i just hope demar gets his jersey retired before vc i really want to be the first jersey retired by the raptors
nba,not_removed,jersey just going to be big jersey with both their numbers
nba,not_removed,what about shaq and kobe s

nba,not_removed,should watch the open gym series on youtube pretty hype
nba,not_removed,interviewer is that the little man on your shoulder demar yea the bad one too
nba,not_removed,i bet it would be the dopest feeling ever to be highand then remember you just iced a game for your team in madison square garden in front of people with a super clutch shot over a former mvp and that you play in the nba and youre a millionaire
nba,not_removed,yeah im hoping demar was either doing it jokingly or was being conscious that its lowrys bad wrist
nba,not_removed,sick man which team are you in now

nba,not_removed,i do hey listen you guys will be better in the years to come ok it will be alright
nba,not_removed,man youre really the goat raptors hater my dude i mustve downvoted you like times by now for your hater ass comments lol
nba,not_removed,vc was disrespectful to the raps doesnt deserve his jersey to be retired how you going to retire someones jersey who half the fan base hates
nba,not_removed,the admiral looks like hes filming the hottest rb music video of
nba,not_removed,♫i can show you the world♫
nba,not_removed,it would be nice even if you werent high
nba,not_removed,people msg hold like max
nba,not_removed,probably both tbh
nba,not_removed,your mom
nba,not_removed,kobe and pau is still one of the best bromances ever
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,source saying he has lupus im pretty certain that its only his mom
nba,not_removed,dolan just accepted your challenge
nba,not_removed,you have to be relevant before you can have haters
nba,not_removed,vc put toronto on the map sure it wasnt the most graceful exit but most people have moved on and thank him for what he did if it wasnt for him we woulda been gone along with the grizzlies i didnt understand his frustration back then cause i was young but vc wanted toronto to build a contending team around him and they didnt i dont blame him for wanting to leave
nba,not_removed,you speak the truth too many young fans on here have no idea how vc treated his own teammates that piece of garbage doesnt belong anywhere near our rafters
nba,not_removed,bro if the lakers can retire shaqs jersey and give him a freaking statue even with his awkward exit the raps will retire vince
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i am an adult
nba,not_removed,he was referencing both in stadium crowds and in tc viewership
nba,not_removed,hows lowry bro did you scold him for his hand
nba,not_removed,i heard kobe would sometimes let pau hold his umbrella for him is it true
nba,not_removed,nope not you ive already been defiled
nba,not_removed,must be salty over todays loss huh our sub has more subscribers than yours and raps get more attendance than you do youre pulling shit out of your ass enjoy being seed
nba,not_removed,you havent been relevant in years but plenty of people still hate you and the knicks 😂
nba,not_removed,well thats not even true also they are both allstars not sure how more relevant u can be in terms of basketball
nba,not_removed,lol knicks flair your relevancy this year has been entirely off the court lmao
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i might have to start upvoting you for your commitment to the salt i think youve come full circle to being kind of endearing
nba,not_removed,wanting to leave and quietly requesting a trade while you continue to play hard is fine no one wouldve really been too mad at him however wanting to leave and loudly demanding a trade whining about not wanting to dunk anymore blatantly playing lazy and godawful to sabotage your value having your mom be an annoying little shit in the media if you thought lavar ball was bad vcs mom is a thousand times worse and tipping off the opposing teams bench to a play you are running out of a timeout just to spite your team thats pretty much the exact way you dont go about it ive moved on and am okay with his number being retired because of his cultural impact and the fact that feelings from how it ended will fade over time but i still think we should wait on doing so till after lowry and dd i mean for example the leafs havent retired curtis josephs number yet after he pulled an msl and left the team just via free agency instead of trade because he was salty about being relegated to backup status on team canada with the coach of team canada also being the coach of the leafs rip pat quinn and thats even though they brought him in for a stint years later so he can finish his career here and yes given this franchise had arguably its most successful period since the during those years and the fact that he was a far greater reason for our prosperity then than felix was in the early i do believe he should have his number retired
nba,not_removed,wonder if this is how okc fans are gonna feel about durant years later
nba,not_removed,ive forgiven vc and im thankful for all that hes given the raptors however id still rather see dds jersey up there than vcs
nba,not_removed,we would not have been gone the fan base is too big ya he did good things but i dont think he deserves his jersey retired he admitted to not trying and sat out games on purpose ask any fans who were actually old enough to remember he shat all over the team and the fan base
nba,not_removed,i dont know why you two are getting down voted retiring a number should be the easiest most ubiquitous decision a team can make the fact that you can make an easy argument why he shouldnt have a banner is an easy threshold not to do it
nba,not_removed,their going off of youtube videos all these throw back dunk contests and how he acts now plus the media dont really go into detail about how he acted they just brush it off as he had ups and downs so basically they dont know shit and we get down voted because of that
nba,not_removed,to be fair shaqs exit was a decision made by the lakers with the kobe shaq feud they had choose between them and they chose kobe sure it was an awkward exit but the lakers had no reason to have hard feelings against shaq the way toronto did against vc but i do agree its been long enough and vc has done enough for the raptors to be celebrated
nba,not_removed,shaq brought them rings vc didnt people only remember championships at the end of the day thats all that matters
nba,not_removed,im a man im
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,bruh we out here roasting the knicks saying they aint got more then people watching there games
nba,not_removed,only way to get that triangle chemistry
nba,not_removed,dont bother with this guy he does the same crap on rbaseball with the blue jays too just hates canada for whatever reason
nba,not_removed,i know youre taking shots at the entire fan base for whatever reason but attendance wise the raptors are only about fans above us and its probably because our tickets are just so fucking expensive being in the financial headquarter of the world lets not get so cocky and take shots at the entire fucking fan base he doesnt represent us
nba,not_removed,this is exactly it if youre not gonna retire his jersey for how he left retire it for the impact he left huge canadian uprising in basketball due to the guy
nba,not_removed,its very possible only time will tell but for now fuck kd
nba,not_removed,durant is worse running to a team that won games the previous season and you blew a lead to
nba,not_removed,have not of
nba,not_removed,a big issue was the strength of the canadian dollar all the players are paid in usd and the money made in toronto was cad around the time the canadian dollar was hovering around usd vince carter brought attention to the raps and that brought people into the arena and fans over the country as for him shitting all over the team i guess its more of a time heals all wounds analogy
nba,not_removed,yeah i dont think that people realize the only cities in the nba bigger than toronto literally have teams if you factor in how that splits the fan base toronto might be the largest market in the league
nba,not_removed,im not a kid
nba,not_removed,thats true why expense an entire fan base over one dumbass knicks fan much love your city is great love your stadium fuck that ujakethejoker
nba,not_removed,the vince carter generation of canadian basketball is enough to have his jersey retired imo
nba,not_removed,i think its a very different situation although vince meant a lot to toronto their team wasnt in championship contention over the years before he left kd and brodie were up and were a game away from the finals many many people thought that had a huge mismatch favoring okc against the cavs i mean add more fucking piece or none at all and they were still contending but what did kd do he left a championship contending team for an ever better championship contending team and for that i doubt okc will ever forgive him and they shouldnt hes the biggest bitch ive ever seen and he should never show his face in okc besides his games again
nba,not_removed,seriously this might be reddits biggest grammar issue between this and effectaffect
nba,not_removed,raptors players get paid in usd a weak cad is better for them because their american dollar is now worth more unless youre talking about the owners
nba,not_removed,sorry just hurt that i love the raptors fan base only to get shit on by them 😞 much love for the love your poutine
nba,not_removed,yeah rough for the owners having vc in the city certainly helped bring tons of cashflow into the team though
nba,not_removed,you tell me which fans shit on you ill scold em
nba,not_removed,the thunder are legitimate title contenders for the next to years durant would be a fool in terms of championship success likelihood if he didnt stay
nba,not_removed,hold on ill ask him
nba,not_removed,yes year deal imo
nba,not_removed,edit
nba,not_removed,resign
nba,not_removed,no
nba,not_removed,i never thought he would actually leave
nba,not_removed,hes making a farting noise with his mouth there
nba,not_removed,the thunder are legitimate title contenders for the next to years i heard this in too then we got injured for the postseason years in a row and lost durant for the season
nba,not_removed,although i agree with you theres one exception to what youre saying durant to gsw
nba,not_removed,i mean hes got options what if he goes to boston or miami easier chance to get to the finals though if he went gsw or spurs that would be insane it would drastically increase his chance to win a championship he would be a fool if went to washington
nba,not_removed,oh so he did do better on jumpshots later in the game
nba,not_removed,future of the franchise
nba,not_removed,winslow looks good but that announcer said spurs got the best frontcourt in the nba blake dj dwight milsap maybe even gobert favors pau is averaging on and terrible dhes not that good anymore he had a good game tonight but before this he had turnovers and fgm on the season
nba,not_removed,yeah he started the game something like but finished
nba,not_removed,sf is a front court position too
nba,not_removed,he had last night looked fine to me i wouldnt judge based on the first couple games of the season especially on a team like the spurs that doesnt ask him to do much
nba,not_removed,pau offensively will be fine he will not average ppg for the season and he will not shoot he needs to find his place in the sa offense and that will only come with time plus sa can throw dedmon out there when they need a defensive boost
nba,not_removed,iirc he actially made all of his field goals in a row started went to and ended
nba,not_removed,that takes us out of being one of the best front courts though
nba,not_removed,luc moute is just one of the most unselfish players i know hes currently averaging but we all know he could easily do a night
nba,not_removed,oh trust me i agree i love the work that luc does dont know about the a night part though lol
nba,not_removed,these are fun for sure but that last chick had on the infamous baron davis cavs jersey she definitely gets a pass btw thanks again for that trade clippers
nba,not_removed,bucks troll game is on point
nba,not_removed,wants to know who kevin love is smh dude gets no respekt
nba,not_removed,hahaha
nba,not_removed,does anyone else remember when gsw was in milwaukee there was some awesome captions there too
nba,not_removed,as soon as i saw that jersey it made me smile good for her what was that trade officially mo williams for the salary dump of baron davis and an unprotected first
nba,not_removed,we also sent them jamario moon
nba,not_removed,go away
nba,not_removed,its not the nbas place to denounce a presidential candidate no matter how shitty it is perfectly within their limits to move certain events due to certain human rights violations occurring in the area if thats the point youre attempting to make what is the league supposed to do boycott america for the next years if trump becomes president you didnt really think this through
nba,not_removed,you have legal protection to keep your vote private why would anyone want to alienate paying fans by disclosing their political beliefs unless they are so adamantly on one side of the road
nba,not_removed,because they have the right to their own privacy
nba,not_removed,wow this is a special kind of shitpost
nba,not_removed,not everyone wants to broadcast their every belief at any given time
nba,not_removed,im not sure you know what hypocrisy is they are allowed to speak on one issue without commenting on every single thing that happens in the world also you shouldnt look to nba players for political insight they comment on things like race relations because it directly effects them and they likely have related personal experiences
nba,not_removed,what has trump said that needs denouncing people act like the dude is literally hitler lol and calling for genocide and whatnot and from a business standpoint at least half the country supports trump so it really wouldnt be smart to call all of those people pieces of shit and still expect them to use your product
nba,not_removed,your username is how i feel about this topic
nba,not_removed,id bet money that there isnt a lot of overlap between nba fans and trump voters
nba,not_removed,calm down david duke
nba,not_removed,what would you consider a lot id say that at least onequarter to onethird of people who identify as republicanconservative watch the nba
nba,not_removed,a lot if of them boycotted the nba the league would be in trouble who identify as republicanconservative thats not the same thing as voting for trump though
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i expect nothing and somehow ill still be letdown
nba,not_removed,can anyone explain to me why kd would do this if we honestly had no shot
nba,not_removed,here i was hoping durant would have decided by sometime on july
nba,not_removed,thats gonna spark some fireworks
nba,not_removed,if it wasnt for durants name in it this would be one of the whitest free agency reports of all time
nba,not_removed,he wants a cakewalk to the ecf
nba,not_removed,hope he brings back some hampton tomatoes
nba,not_removed,i love kd i wish him nothing but success wherever he goes it will be absolutely difficult to part from westbrook and the thunder organization though
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,theres no way he goes to boston that roster doesnt have real offensive threats to match up with cavs or even raptors hell never make it out of east semifinals hes going to the warriors but he will be getting healthy dose of crab legs this
nba,not_removed,i came
nba,not_removed,wow thats a great shop
nba,not_removed,good relation with ainge ainge was deadset on drafting him in when we were in the lottery but fell to im sure he built a good enough rapport with kd and his family that kd is atleast showing him some respect honestly it makes us look legit so if hes just honeydickin us im cool baby
nba,not_removed,he gets to keep the ipad they give him that they load with pictures of him in celtics jerseys and whatever
nba,not_removed,id feel a lot better about your chances if you had made a trade for butler
nba,not_removed,as a courtesy to roc nation sports
nba,not_removed,data gathering and letting teams know what they need to do if he is going to sign with them after he goes back to okc for a year
nba,not_removed,idk why you thought that hes not meeting with the warriors til saturday
nba,not_removed,triggered
nba,not_removed,just wait until gordon hayward is a free agent and he wants meetings in aspen
nba,not_removed,im cool with that
nba,not_removed,😀😁☺😐😑😒
nba,not_removed,yeah most players in the league would rather not play for lottery teams
nba,not_removed,the lakers said they can pick i can win the powerball
nba,not_removed,hes going back to okc
nba,not_removed,well hes not going to the wolves i can tell you that
nba,not_removed,lol the raptors get real with durant almost any team in the east is immediately the seed
nba,not_removed,i conquered
nba,not_removed,i cried
nba,not_removed,hes actually from the future
nba,not_removed,my delusional theory weve had offers about multiple players that we werent willing to sell house for unless it landed kd at the meeting danny puts out pictures of said players with a little red button in front of each and says if you join us you can press one of these buttons and have whoever you want then kd politely says im taking my talents to the bay and everyone is pissed
nba,not_removed,does jay z have some sort of connections up in boston or something
nba,not_removed,hockey ruined me hockey free agency all happens on july and its insane sometimes especially being in toronto
nba,not_removed,you didnt see first
nba,not_removed,lebron did the same for lac a few years back it helps with reputations and is a good look for agents and whatnot
nba,not_removed,no but i am sure they want to build some good connections between them and boston granting a meeting with durant can go a long way to that
nba,not_removed,im legally blind i just come and conquer
nba,not_removed,makes sense sorry about that
nba,not_removed,kawhi leonard is blowing me away with his facilitating this year pau gasol with his breakout game for us patty mills is an incredible offensive spark whiteside is a monster
nba,not_removed,kawhis game got me so hard right now small sample size and a lot can happen but knowing the spurs consistency we could be looking at the mvp right here
nba,not_removed,kawhi would have my vote for most well rounded player of the year tbh whiteside and dragic both compliment each others games so much i love it
nba,not_removed,lavar ball lmao my son can easily dunk what a scrub
nba,not_removed,dr ubootum this game is too good not to make a lowlight video for
nba,not_removed,lmao i love curry but he cannot dunke
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,if only he was big like klay
nba,not_removed,cringe
nba,not_removed,delete this
nba,not_removed,reminds me of him and westbrook micd up at the asg last year or the year before curry tells wb something like hey youre going to laugh but i can only catch a lob from the left side
nba,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkpoxwzvfusg of course he can probably very few nba players that cant dunk in the right circumstances
nba,not_removed,might be to currys benefit though if he could jump higher or just blow through people like a westbrook he might not have ever been as forced to develop that beautiful outside jumper when he was growing up just food for thought i dont know if thats true or not but i aint gonna hate on curry for not being able to dunk his ball skills and shooting skills are out of this world maybe not being as physically dominant helped him develop some of those skills that said curry is still one hell of an athlete so dont minscontrue that
nba,not_removed,resign or resign
nba,not_removed,dont give up basketball yet dion
nba,not_removed,mad respect to dion lost his brother mid season and played his heart out in the playoffs he deserves it
nba,not_removed,the most important slash
nba,not_removed,kd loves him really loves him i think hell probably be here next year
nba,not_removed,i think hes worth more to okc than almost any other team hard to seem him getting a big enough offer sheet to scare okc from matching
nba,not_removed,tweet video streamable mirror sending a pm for conversion is temporarily unavailable its been bugged and im just getting around to fixing it should be back up within a few days bugsfeedbacksuggestions send me a pm
nba,not_removed,can anyone explain how he went from kucklehead scorer to mr right decision in such short notice and how westbrook didnt pick up on that not throwing shade at rw but he could have used some shooting iq to avoid with weird kamkaze lay in
nba,not_removed,what kind of contract is he expected to get
nba,not_removed,happy to have him
nba,not_removed,if his playoff discipline and play on both ends of the floor is a sign of growth then he could really be the starting sg for this thunder team at the beginning of next season he played with what seemed like more poise then westbrook tonight despite not hitting his open jumpers if his growth is for real the thunder may have gotten a steal in their trade for him
nba,not_removed,rest easy thunder fans
nba,not_removed,i thought he said he wanted to go to philly but its smart for him to stay
nba,not_removed,i was really impressed with dion waiters his drive and dish game was killing us and he should get a post defense rating on
nba,not_removed,damni know they lost but they doesnt mean he has to quit basketball
nba,not_removed,yeah he can take too
nba,not_removed,resign spelling is slacking because of the loss
nba,not_removed,yeah i was so glad he balled out the dude deserved it after that tragedy and how much crap people talked about him
nba,not_removed,cue the sarcastic pass the fucking ball to me
nba,not_removed,id be a bit worried about philly banking on his potential philly connection but besides that theres no huge threat to wrangle him away
nba,not_removed,that depends when you look at who else okc needs to sign this year and the next i dont think hes as high on the okc priority list if he gets a solid offer elsewhere roberson is also coming off his rookie contract as is adams and then you have durant westbrook ibaka you want to keep but also have to replace foye morrow and collison
nba,not_removed,he had like assists
nba,not_removed,he played great during playoffs and really controlled his shot selection well until tonight at least but still huge improvement plus his already solid defense westbrook did for a short while and then magically reverted but i guess it helps that dion isnt leading the team so its easier to criticize him
nba,not_removed,billy has done great work with him
nba,not_removed,coach d is a college coach at heart his specialty is developing players like waiters
nba,not_removed,i think mil
nba,not_removed,lmao why is this dude getting downvoted
nba,not_removed,balled out he was useless the last three games
nba,not_removed,he has said he wants to play for philly
nba,not_removed,but also have to replace foye morrow and collison in theory weve already done that weve got payne huestis and mcgary in the pipeline all of whom should i hope have expanded roles next season
nba,not_removed,wade has a competent agent ftfy
nba,not_removed,wade is drunk on a boat with his best friends
nba,not_removed,i am open to seeing fewer reposts
nba,not_removed,harden right now pg was way too inconsistent this past season he had a great series against the raptors but id take harden times right now
nba,not_removed,harden for now his elite scoring and playmaking is on another level from george pgs defense makes it closer than it would be otherwise but i still put harden ahead
nba,not_removed,mvb
nba,not_removed,biased take james harden unbiased take see biased take
nba,not_removed,im not a big fan but dude was robbed how does harden not make the or allnba team this year in ppg in assists led league in free throws attempted and made most pointers after the splash bros in win shares in per in vorp sure he led the league in turnovers but leading the league in minutes and playing all factors in to that tldr his team shit the bed but it was not his fault dude had a remarkable season and the sportswriters who dole out postseason awards should be ashamed of themselves
nba,not_removed,james harden carries a team like no other and is a top offensive player i never see george ahead of harden
nba,not_removed,harden
nba,not_removed,harden he carries the rockets so hard
nba,not_removed,pg cause we already got a top sg
nba,not_removed,easy harden have him in my top
nba,not_removed,if were consistent id pick him but he always have lulls in the season where hes shooting terribly
nba,not_removed,always pg such a clutch dude
nba,not_removed,pg is the better two way player but he cant carry a team offensively like harden can id take pg because hes a great defender on top of being a really good offensive player but i understand why people would rather have harden
nba,not_removed,paul george this point has obviously been beaten to death but hardens defense is so awful and paul george is an allnba defender hardens better offensively but the gap really isnt big enough to make up for his defense pg dominated offensively in that pacers series and was completely locking up derozan
nba,not_removed,james harden and its not even close
nba,not_removed,george and i dont think its that close george can defend as well as most wings while being a quailty offensive player as he showed at times in the playoffs think george could have an mvp type season this year
nba,not_removed,harden and its genuinely not close i love george but harden is top player at worst and george is fringe top at best
nba,not_removed,it confuses you that different people have different rankings for star players in the league im not asking to be a dick im just curious
nba,not_removed,i think its the kind of thing where george would get a higher scouting report if they were both coming out of college right now due to his insane combination of skill and length especially on defense but harden is still the bettermore valuable player and has the numbers to back it up george has only been in mvp voting time in his career harden times to of which in the
nba,not_removed,if i have a scorer or good ball handler already im taking george if it is a fantasy draft and i havent picked anybody for my team yet id take harden harden is a better first option while still needs to work on is consistency to really build an offense around george is great when he is on but you cant ensure success around a guy who plays like an mvp one month and then is shooting the next month
nba,not_removed,offensive consistency is a massive deal pg has shown thus far in his career that he will not until proven otherwise be even much of an offensive plus for half of your teams season harden meanwhile is a guy who will bail you out virtually every night that you need it i feel way more comfortable looking for a solid pg was far from elite this past season regardless of what people saw against a derozan who got shut down by everyone else he faced too defensive forward to put next to my guaranteed efficient points off tough shots than i do finding shot creators to put around a guy who just shot in iso this past season percentile and cant shoot from midrange yet thinks hes the new kobe and takes the bad looks that come with it take into account passing and it stops even being a real discussion imo
nba,not_removed,paul george easily
nba,not_removed,give me the guy who plays defense
nba,not_removed,paul george dude went to back to back ecf and lead his team to the seed in the east before harden has only had great postseason run which was last year and its mainly because the clippers choked while he was on the bench not taking anything away from him but the rockets lost to gsw in convincingly and dominantly with stepth and klay getting hurt paul george gave lebron in his peak a run for his money besides last year the rockets have been a first round exit with harden paul george is elite both sides of the ball and elevates his play in the postseason give that man a true supporting cast instead of these defensive teams with no offensive firepower and the pacers would be even better james harden is elite but weve seen him play subpar in the playoffs and in some years against the blazers deight howard was the better postseason player paul george doesnt have that luxury if he sucks the pacers ship sinks
nba,not_removed,im admittedly biased because pg is my favorite player in the league but ill take paul george any day
nba,not_removed,depends not sure if pg can be a number guy on the offensive end on a championship team but his defense is sooo damm good so it might put him over the top
nba,not_removed,if pg can put up an entire season of what we have seen spurts of then i see it being a closer race way superstar vs one man offense unto himself but right now i think people really dont realize how bad that rockets team is and how even with the turnover numbers how rare the numbers harden puts up are
nba,not_removed,kawhi vs harden is a better question still go harden on that though
nba,not_removed,he put up legit mvp numbers but his defense sucked and his team sucked which almost immediately dqs you
nba,not_removed,lol we biased bro but thats tru
nba,not_removed,i always see george ahead of harden along with kawhi
nba,not_removed,carried them to the seed on a team with bad chemistry but one that got to the wcf two seasons ago
nba,not_removed,he carried your team pretty damn good this year more wins then the rockets and took your team to a game against the seed
nba,not_removed,i love george but harden is top player and george is fringe top i mean you say its genuinely not close yet only separate them by a few rankings lol
nba,not_removed,pg is probably the best player in the league its not as far apart as you make it seem
nba,not_removed,nah its just that so many people disagree with each other on this one its always controversial and i cant make my own opinion since its so close
nba,not_removed,hes been the first option on very good ecf team before
nba,not_removed,most people would chose harden in those cases because he can initiate offense and score at an elite level those are great numbers and he can carry your offense as a first option theres only a few i would chose over harden
nba,not_removed,me too
nba,not_removed,i hear ya dont get me wrong it was def his defense that did him in but when youre that good offensively cmon points twenty nine his team sucked but it obviously wasnt his fault lowry averaged compared to his id be interested to know when the last time someone averaged over and didnt make even the team cant imagine thats ever happened idk the same people had no issue voting for him for mvp the year before and its not like his defense was any better in larceny
nba,not_removed,lol but you right
nba,not_removed,really i usually see lebron steph durant kawhi russ harden davis george griffin etc
nba,not_removed,he also took them to the seed his first year in houston when lin parsons and asik were the other main players
nba,not_removed,yeah we saw
nba,not_removed,there is a huge gap between and after that though top is lebron steph kd kawhi russ harden those are all legit mvp candidates
nba,not_removed,george is not better than the follow in my opinion lebron steph durant kawhi russell westbrook harden davis griffin
nba,not_removed,i agree i think the difference between pgs offense and hardens offense is a lot closer than the difference between pgs defense and hardens defense its still a tossup but i feel like im more likely to say paul george out of times
nba,not_removed,plays both ends of the floor got props from bron
nba,not_removed,but when do you ever have an option of pairing kawhi with a generational offensive talent its very rare you start a team from scratch you take harden i agree
nba,not_removed,i cannot ever see george being the best player on a championship team i can definitely see harden doing that
nba,not_removed,switch up davis and and we good
nba,not_removed,blake davis and pg arent that far off honestly it seems like youre just arbitrarily cutting the list off where harden is ranked
nba,not_removed,honestly id rather have carrying my team than kawhi and i think he is better than kawhi
nba,not_removed,got props from bron lol
nba,not_removed,kobe have harden props he chose him for mvp whats your point
nba,not_removed,oh for sure if you have a first option you always take guys like kawhi elite defender great shooter and doesnt care about the spotlight but as far as building a team from scratch id take harden even though kawhi has improved so much
nba,not_removed,i wish okc wouldve kept harden
nba,not_removed,then switch davis and blake and were better
nba,not_removed,in my opinion they are far off those players i listed are the elite players of this league and are a tier ahead of blake davis pg lillard just my thoughts love to hear your opinion
nba,not_removed,personally i think the opposite mvp voting last year seems to bear that out as well
nba,not_removed,at least i made someone laugh with my joke
nba,not_removed,haha it was a joke
nba,not_removed,i dont lol harden is htown for many years to come hopefully
nba,not_removed,lol in no world if blake better than ad
nba,not_removed,i think those are indeed the top in the nba but that next i mentioned would be right after them with lillard in the next
nba,not_removed,i personally think that the gap between and westbrook wasnt that large last year paul put up something like on great efficiency with his teams second best player out for the majority of the season and led the clippers to a great record westbrook had more pointsrebounds but with worse efficiency and a better team chris paul also plays better defense than westbrook but ill still give westbrook a slight edge over paul still think that theyre in the same tier though
nba,not_removed,mvp voting does not equal who is the better player
nba,not_removed,what im sure its a toss up based on preference lets see if rnba agrees submitted a text post edit some reason none of my posts go through karma maybe
nba,not_removed,its certainly one factor that feeds into the equation
nba,not_removed,ill post it
nba,not_removed,lol or not mine isnt going through either
nba,not_removed,weird man fuck it both are great players
nba,not_removed,yeah man blake has been my favorite player since he was in college but honestly ad was a top player just last season and he was this season as well but since we werent winning people think less of him
nba,not_removed,i agree games back of the seed should be a lot higher than a seed
nba,not_removed,because portland is the seed
nba,not_removed,really detroit and us are tied for and and they cut it off at lol
nba,not_removed,man can we please make the playoffs itd make the east so interesting
nba,not_removed,damn it i tried so hard to be first to make the joke
nba,not_removed,its from the seed and everyone else continues from that
nba,not_removed,the meme that refuses to die
nba,not_removed,can u explain why portland was the seed
nba,not_removed,no you arent detroit is half a game ahead of you
nba,not_removed,well whooping our asses was a good start
nba,not_removed,i too was hoping to get in on the games behind action
nba,not_removed,i thought arsenal was in the west
nba,not_removed,division winners
nba,not_removed,at the time of the picture we were tied we didnt play today so weve been all day not that i really care though we have like a of making the playoffs right now
nba,not_removed,thank mirotic who just realized he can play basketball you guys will hit that switch once the playoffs start
nba,not_removed,looks like we were games behind this guy
nba,not_removed,rsoccer
nba,not_removed,i was just getting pissed ever time he made those crazy lol
nba,not_removed,giannis isnt mentioned a lot i might just be spending too much time on this sub but i see his name popping up all the time
nba,not_removed,steph curry i dont know why you people under rating him steph has proven him self to be a clear top pg in the league steph rubio steph jennings steph ennis steph udrih
nba,not_removed,cody zeller
nba,not_removed,ive seen a lot of posts about underrated players but usually those threads just talk about stars that arent mentioned a lot like giannis brook lopez and kemba
nba,not_removed,there was also a giannis for mvp thread a few days ago
nba,not_removed,this is a more likely scenario for kg coaching reunited with doc and pierce while staying near his california home
nba,not_removed,no lie i had a dream that kg was sitting next to me at dinner was a cool dude
nba,not_removed,coach kg
nba,not_removed,i could see him coming onto a team late in the season like dahntay jones randomly winding up on the cavs
nba,not_removed,kg and pierce reunited and it feels so good
nba,not_removed,kg coaching dj and diamond would be awesome
nba,not_removed,weird theyre practicing at uci zot zot
nba,not_removed,blakes gonna be a beast this year
nba,not_removed,doesnt he want to get into ownership
nba,not_removed,could kgs presence be the influence that puts the clippers over the top from all ive heard about him and seen of him it really could be as a coach of course i think he doesnt have anything left to give on the court
nba,not_removed,years back kg as a player on clipps would have been great just like how it was on celtics
nba,not_removed,kg couldnt coach just because he probably meditated in a sauna before games to sweat enough to put a lake in the sahara if he did that and then wore a suit the arena would start flooding though id be pulling for him and searching for gifs of the death stares hed give to players and officials when they mess up
nba,not_removed,anyone else spot the alien lifeform in the clip
nba,not_removed,he lives in la so it makes sense sure as fuck not going to lakers camplol
nba,not_removed,well he stayed without basketball for a couple of days thats a pretty long stretch as a retired player
nba,not_removed,id put much greater odds on kg playing this year for the clippers than him coaching them
nba,not_removed,im not sure about coaching but kg would be the best official spokesperson and media frontman for the clippers or any franchise he chooses to sign with there will be so much trash talk sick burns and savage replies heck might as well give him the clippers twitter account as well and half of the media related jobs
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,kg and would probably get into multiple fist fights and kg would probably break blakes arm again for some reason i dont see those guys getting along
nba,not_removed,you heard it here first folks
nba,not_removed,big if true
nba,not_removed,this deserves its own post
nba,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwczkdcbtbk
nba,not_removed,plz share
nba,not_removed,please
nba,not_removed,wonder what ray allen is doing this season
nba,not_removed,yeah diamond stone will really be able to meditate on what hes learned while sitting on the bench
nba,not_removed,you cant teach talent
nba,not_removed,docs son is on the uci team they clips were here last year too
nba,not_removed,greetings fellow anteater lets go to the pub
nba,not_removed,kobe used to go on morning jogs at the uci track they must have something going on with the professional leagues
nba,not_removed,the bren is a nice place zot zot they holding a free practice viewing on saturday too
nba,not_removed,mvp hype train mvp hype train
nba,not_removed,i bought i heard kg was decent as a rim protector in mn
nba,not_removed,doubt it hes physically done considering the amount of preparation and effort it takes for him to play even minutes in a regular season game plus the clippers have six bigs none of which i see them cutting
nba,not_removed,doubt it that would cheapen his retirement with the twolves
nba,not_removed,no way he plays this season his body cant handle it
nba,not_removed,hypercompetitive players hate playing against each other but love playing together dont see any reason why he wouldnt get along with them edit also when did kg break blakes arm
nba,not_removed,recently said hed love to have played with kg
nba,not_removed,ok fine kg for kat then if you insist
nba,not_removed,just think about being a ref in that situation cp wont shut up kg wont shut up doc yelling at you during timeouts any chance we can trade for matt barnes we might see a ref quit his job on live tv lmao
nba,not_removed,elton brand
nba,not_removed,michael jordan wait was this an mj joke
nba,not_removed,magic uhh rip hamilton is trying to right now i read
nba,not_removed,blake does need a new shooting coach now that bob thate is gone amirite
nba,not_removed,couldnt hurt him to learn from a goat
nba,not_removed,he doesnt have to
nba,not_removed,dang i didnt realize austin had been demoted that far
nba,not_removed,ill meet you under the playboy themed anteater portrait
nba,not_removed,kobe makes a little more sense since his main home is in dana point i think easier to drive up to uci than to take the helicopter to downtown la
nba,not_removed,the rams did training camp there they have nice facilities and its a slight bit quieter down in irvine than it is in la to keep the guys out of trouble
nba,not_removed,lets get it moving
nba,not_removed,choo choo
nba,not_removed,i thought you said six rings
nba,not_removed,hes saying that theres basically a chance kg will coach for the clips
nba,not_removed,look at rondo and wade both hated each other as rivals but it seems both of them are excited to have one another as teammates
nba,not_removed,this seems only fair
nba,not_removed,matt barnes and cousins to the clippers the first time a whole team will get tossed from techs
nba,not_removed,quit his will to live
nba,not_removed,and hes probably gonna make the roster again this year
nba,not_removed,lol this was my immediate thought i think hes joking but then again theres no sso we should probably just down vote him into oblivion
nba,not_removed,he does and ray allens jumpshot is the equivalent of griffey jrs swing fuck can you image blake hitting the way allen did from range
nba,not_removed,lol i know im just giving him a hard time
nba,not_removed,it was in newport so it was literally a minute drive up macarther
nba,not_removed,brice johnson will lead us there soon enough
nba,not_removed,and look at what wade did to rondos arm
nba,not_removed,yup he used to catch movies at the big newport theatre right there came in once late night between home games of the nba finals while i was working there none of the patrons knewthere werent many cuz it was a weekday night but all of us as employees were going out of our way to theatre check the film he was seeing
nba,not_removed,sorry i think we all just suck at getting sarcasm but we think were better than we actually are because of the instances where its really obvious and we get it holy runon sentences
nba,not_removed,haha i feel you man i guess a lot of people just follow whatever the first few people do without thinking
nba,not_removed,i guess people just dont like you
nba,not_removed,how could you be mo harkless
nba,not_removed,is it time for popcorn
nba,not_removed,because the quantity of points theyre able to acquire during the length of a basketball game does not surpass that of their opponents
nba,not_removed,its just odd that the blazers completely flipped the script last year they were one of the best teams in the nba and had the lowest salary now they suck and are in the penalty because they shelled out millions to mediocre players like crabbe turner ezeli and leaonard
nba,not_removed,george karl
nba,not_removed,guys who got paid suck apparently
nba,not_removed,no for real though some things just cant be said problems with teams arent always so simple people like karl and uninformed fans want to point at lillard or stotts or touches or whatever when its likely a combination of things and for mo to speak on it means venting in a big way we aint a team no more everybody worrying about themselves and doing their job but that dont mean doing they part we went from a hungry team with great help d great communication with no egos now everyone out here got paid and busy booking sponsors and going to galas or filming music videos when we need to be focusing on the game mentally preparing doing film reading scouting reports and it aint dame so dont even get it twisted like that its all of us dawg if we dont get on the same page coaches players everyone and start caring about the result on the court and believing in ourselves and each other and building that trust we aint gon be shit and thats real mo harkless probably
nba,not_removed,i wouldnt be suprised if guys like turner and crabbe arent trying now that theyve been paid big edit how are those two defensively
nba,not_removed,mo and a for okafor itll solve all your problems please
nba,not_removed,weak statement if youre going to play that roll then go all the way
nba,not_removed,then someone turn the camera off but leave the mic on
nba,not_removed,total speculation here but im guessing his line about turning the camera off had more to do with wanting to say something like we are playing like shit versus dropping some truth bomb about discord in the locker room
nba,not_removed,its evan turner
nba,not_removed,is this the first time this joke has been made cause im dying in the night i hear them told the portlandess story ever told somewhere along the road they lost the ball how could you be mo harkless
nba,not_removed,so heartless
nba,not_removed,because hes not less harkmo
nba,not_removed,im the reporter and after i turned off the camera i can confirm that he said that george karl was right the whole time
nba,not_removed,for the record i dont think he was suggesting he would point the finger or id discord among ranks in fact he tried to back off its just jason quick doing jason quick stuff he also said he didnt sense any animosity in the locker room so its probably not a big deal
nba,not_removed,source
nba,not_removed,big if true
nba,not_removed,they were not one of the best teams last year they were decent but benefitted from an incredibly weak seeds in the west they were probably around the best team
nba,not_removed,overachievement
nba,not_removed,the blazers had the exact same record at this point of last years season but i agree with you something aint right and i wouldnt bet on them righting the ship
nba,not_removed,turner was an awful move
nba,not_removed,was right
nba,not_removed,everyone except him
nba,not_removed,the problem has been our frontcourt aminu has been hurt plumlee is a poor rim protector meyers is coming off an injury and just isnt very good and ed has been significantly worse meyers is the only one who got paid the guys who got paid have all been playing well crabbe is playing like he usually does et is at his boston averages moe is playing great cj and dame have been good as well especially cj no one watches our games though so people make assumptions based on popular narratives
nba,not_removed,probably
nba,not_removed,crabbe is a decent low end and d guy but thats the issue hes not getting paid big bucks to be decent the dude really disappears during stretches like you wont even know hes in the game until he hits or bricks a i said it in the summer and ill say it now we shoulda just let brooklyn have him
nba,not_removed,crabbe is playing the way crabbe has always played he is a really good shooter and not much else they need to get him more open looks or he isnt going to be worth anything close to what they paid him turner was just an awful fit no idea why they wasted that capspace trade him to minnesota thibs is probably desperate for any vet
nba,not_removed,i think you spelled damian lillard wrong
nba,not_removed,nah its an old thing i remember singing it when he was at st johns
nba,not_removed,its old there is even a reddit user named howcouldubemoharkless or something magic fan
nba,not_removed,yes
nba,not_removed,whos man is this
nba,not_removed,im mo harkless and this is incorrect
nba,not_removed,also it would be very odd to point a finger at dame in the game he didnt play in lol multiple beat writers including freeman and holdahl have said repeatedly that the lockerroom is good chemistry is good and no one is turning on each other
nba,not_removed,booooring
nba,not_removed,quicks seemed to have gotten a bit slimy and suggestive since his move to working for comcastcsn maybe he wants to be their john canzano
nba,not_removed,magic johnson obviously
nba,not_removed,ti
nba,not_removed,in what way i dont think youre watching if you somehow think turner is to blame sure mil is an overpay but in terms of stats and play were getting exactly what we paid for his last season averages are nearly identical to this seasons despite a rough start he really wasnt an awful move at all you should probably watch the team and form your own opinion instead of regurgitating what this sub tells you
nba,not_removed,he didnt get paid yet tho
nba,not_removed,yup if anyone watched this game they would have seen that this blazer squad will be fine and everyone is overreacting we had the spurs on the ropes for three quaters without dame like they didnt know what to do that first half but no one watches at all and everyone is blaming it on the et and crabbe signings and dame but really its the fact we have no front court and all it would take is a game or two of actually watching our team and forming an intelligent opinion based of that to come to that conclusion but its more fun to blame on dame and the big signings because it makes it seem like the team is irrepuably falling apart not like we have been missing our best defensive player for most of the season or anything
nba,not_removed,im over here waiting for a trade for a quality big man
nba,not_removed,i think people watch blazers games often compared to other teams lillard is a big draw
nba,not_removed,per minute turner is really similar to what he was in boston per points rebounds assists steals block fga tov hes getting less assists less turnovers but that makes sense considering hes playing with new teammates pretty remarkable considering his awful start
nba,not_removed,my bad raises hand slightly in the air
nba,not_removed,how could you be mo harkless
nba,not_removed,if true big
nba,not_removed,turners stats are the same thats not the problem the problem is he does not fit with the team at all nor does he fill any of the needs they had
nba,not_removed,he signed a year deal
nba,not_removed,no stats please this thread is for nonblazers fans to wildly speculate and make assumptions without looking at stats or watching the team
nba,not_removed,well yeah they introduced another ball handler in turner his stats like assist and rebounds are going to go down
nba,not_removed,ez
nba,not_removed,youre wrong on both accounts i dont think youve been watching lately if thats your opinon
nba,not_removed,o i thought we were talkin abt just guys who got overpaid with the new salary cap
nba,not_removed,is there a threadseries of posts with analysis stats and highlights from people who watch the team that youd recommend
nba,not_removed,so allen crabbe isnt playing like the player he has always been he isnt a good shooter am i wrong
nba,not_removed,nobody watches but you buddy
nba,not_removed,ive definitely been watching seems your fandom has blinded you
nba,not_removed,what why
nba,not_removed,there is some pretty good stuff in rripcity good video analysis of the developing defensive schemes this one is by a raps fan who doesnt actually watch the team but gave some pretty good analysis of the stats without making definitive claims there is context and discussion in the comments
nba,not_removed,no youre mostly right crabbe is playing about the same with some brief very brief flashes of improvement still only his second season as a rotation player so there might be room for improvement but yeah he looks about the same as he did last year turner started out horribly but had a really good stretch of games before he went out with a twisted ankle he now looks about the same as he did last season in boston not worth the contract but also not the reason the team is playing poorly
nba,not_removed,and other blazers fans rarely on rnba do people watch more than a couple games not involving their team im sure you have people telling you incorrect stuff about the jazz as well
nba,not_removed,id bet that many people here are hardcore watchers but hardcore watchers dont shitpost
nba,not_removed,the playoffs are great for player development and team experience also money lastly you play to win the game
nba,not_removed,because not everybody just turns over and lets themselves get fucked like you do
nba,not_removed,i never comment on these types of posts but holy shit what a stupid question
nba,not_removed,why shouldnt all teams in the league tank whats the point if the warriors are going to win
nba,not_removed,seeded warriors defeated the seeded mavericks never know what will happen thats why the game is played
nba,not_removed,because making the playoffs and getting the pick is better than missing it and getting the pick like were going to fucking do this season
nba,not_removed,you play to win fucking games this whole if we arent the favorite for a championship just pack it in shit is bitch mode
nba,not_removed,making the playoffs getting a pick teams earlier pretty obvious
nba,not_removed,you clearly havent gotten the fever yet
nba,not_removed,playoffs not the playoffs
nba,not_removed,just missing the playoffs gets them a barely better pick
nba,not_removed,we have the most rounders in this draft anyway so playoff nurk is an absolute must winners win baby
nba,not_removed,try convincing damian lillard to lose games easier said than done
nba,not_removed,they have a decent shot at not getting swept
nba,not_removed,because you always want to see your team in the playoffs even if theyll probably lose its fun if you go in as underdogs also because theres not much pressure
nba,not_removed,actually one of the dumbest things i ever read
nba,not_removed,we a young squad with talent playoff experience is a very real asset i doubt well get swept either
nba,not_removed,playoff games at the rose garden are lit thats why
nba,not_removed,nothing is guaranteed in the playoffs i can see portland winning a few games if they play well and klay or curry go cold also the next acquisition portland needs to obtain to get to the next level should be an established star and not a lottery pick theyll probably have to trade the picks later anyways given their cap situation
nba,not_removed,why did your whore mother spend your youth blowing dudes for pbr tall boys instead of giving you attention so you didnt grow up to be a troll who shitposts on the internet for attention
nba,not_removed,dont let this guys attitude distract you from the fact that golden state blew a series lead
nba,not_removed,cause its fun
nba,not_removed,ending your sentences in lol is a huge pet peeve of mine not sure why it drives me so crazy adding it at the end always makes me think you dont really believe what your saying
nba,not_removed,because why tank when were since asb
nba,not_removed,why does any team want to enter the playoffs if their ultimate prize is an exit because gs and cle
nba,not_removed,because the only difference between and seed is at least a playoff appearance gets a lot of revenue for the owners also theres a chance they can pull out a win if cleveland proved anything last year its that injuries can happen and any lead can be lost
nba,not_removed,hello
nba,not_removed,love this comment
nba,not_removed,hello
nba,not_removed,my best friend from sugarland uses that quote all the fucking time are you black
nba,not_removed,ooo kill em
nba,not_removed,got eeeeeem
nba,not_removed,pack it up this goodnight everyone
nba,not_removed,absolutelydisgustingjpg
nba,not_removed,i thought this was rroastme for a second
nba,not_removed,i love this and i love you for saying this
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,burn
nba,not_removed,bang bang
nba,not_removed,if the warriors lost to the seed id probably have to stop going on the internet lol
nba,not_removed,that was one of the best playoff series ive ever watched both teams were just throwing haymakers at each other dagger threes after dagger threes every possession treated like the last play of a tie game it was incredible
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,they aint the
nba,not_removed,ok teams like the hawks grizzlies and blazers dont have shit to look forward in the playoffs while their players with the exception of blazers are getting old the hawks and grizzlies are about as mediocre as mediocre can get their ceiling is round and out it might not be a bad idea to cut loses sooner then later
nba,not_removed,playoff nurk this i wanna see
nba,not_removed,didnt get swept last year and we may be better now also hi brother
nba,not_removed,no im pretty sure we won game against you guys
nba,not_removed,somebody gotta ps httpiimgurcombecwymjpng into the absolutely disgusting
nba,not_removed,imagine if it was after they had a lead too
nba,not_removed,hi brother happy almost birthday
nba,not_removed,got heem lol
nba,not_removed,im so old
nba,not_removed,jazz are straight crazy this year
nba,not_removed,this lone good exum highlight warms my soul
nba,not_removed,we were dominating for most of the game but a pivotal stretch by the joes ingles and johnson took a point lead to a point massacre
nba,not_removed,slowest pace team in the league putting up points unreal
nba,not_removed,blocks count as missed shots
nba,not_removed,i hope im not getting ahead of myself here when i say that we have the best joes in the league
nba,not_removed,our joes are the best joes our joes are yuge tremendous players true americans our joes are going to make the jazz great again
nba,not_removed,wait joe ingles a true american ill buy it
nba,not_removed,tonight we are all american joes
nba,not_removed,damn americans trying to steal our olympic team
nba,not_removed,american joes reporting for duty
nba,not_removed,noshit
nba,not_removed,but in the other thread all the celtics fans were saying he clearly should have been who should i believe
nba,not_removed,god damn it i enjoyed watching him dominate snek and wanted him to get a nasty stat line
nba,not_removed,with a clear misapplication of the rules occuring if the hawks had lost would they have replayed the game
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,should it have been a technical is it possible to get techs and not be ejected
nba,not_removed,kobesoftgif
nba,not_removed,arent those supposed to count as a team tech
nba,not_removed,i feel like cousins and dwight are hated by nba refs
nba,not_removed,techs ejection or did the nba rewrite the rules yesterday
nba,not_removed,i was think that after it happened ive seen lebron hang on the rim a lot longer and nothing called at all
nba,not_removed,make basketball fun again
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,just watch it for yourself and make your own opinion it was clearly not grounds for ejection though
nba,not_removed,they wouldnt have released that statement had we lost would have created a shit storm
nba,not_removed,they gone
nba,not_removed,yes and yes it should have been a technical for hanging on the rim the assessed technical doesnt count the same as a technical for arguing with the refs or an unnecessary foul it would be more like a delay of game tech you can have multiple delay of game techs and not be ejected there are different degrees of technical a few are enforced for well technical reasons delay of game and defensive three seconds are the two that come immediately to mind but there are others fouls for these offenses dont count toward a players technical limit
nba,not_removed,yes just read the rest of the thread
nba,not_removed,dennisthomas
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,an offensive player hanging on the rim is supposed to be an nonunsportsmanlike technical section iva a technical foul called for delay of game coaches box violations defensive or having a team total of less or more than five players when the ball is alive or an offensive player hanging on his basket ring or backboard is not considered an act of unsportsmanlike conduct the two technical foul ejection rule only applies to unsportsmanlike technicals section vb a maximum of two technicals for unsportsmanlike acts may be assessed any player coach or trainer any of these offenders may be ejected for committing only one unsportsmanlike act and they must be ejected for committing two unsportsmanlike acts
nba,not_removed,i think they are saying he shouldnt have gotten a tech
nba,not_removed,it really wasnt people were saying dwight should have got ejected for that foul on to which is also crazy boston fans are crazy in general but i still love them
nba,not_removed,woosh
nba,not_removed,thanks for the response
nba,not_removed,kobe has wormneck
nba,not_removed,right like two threeinthekeys shouldnt equal an ejection lol
nba,not_removed,then whats the reason for disallowing hanging on the rim i always thought it was an unsportsmanlike thing
nba,not_removed,no just that it was a nonunsportsmanlike technical because he was on offense it would be like ejecting someone for a defensive violation after they had a prior unsportsmanlike technical
nba,not_removed,it was interesting how they were freaking out about howards foul and completely ignoring horfords much more dangerous foul
nba,not_removed,except bill simmons no crazy celticness there
nba,not_removed,thats different because those are assessed as team technicals not individual technicals
nba,not_removed,i think the issue is that hangingontherim calls as an offensive player are just too subjective to risk someone getting kicked out for it so thats why they made that compromise a defender hanging on his own rim does get an unsportsmanlike since theres no reason for it
nba,not_removed,entire team ejected lol
nba,not_removed,did kinda look like al threw him down
nba,not_removed,soft league
nba,not_removed,al horford hold that l you just got shoved you dont get cheers for that
nba,not_removed,is that danny ainge in the front row
nba,not_removed,fuck the celtics
nba,not_removed,dennis be like guys stop fighting i love you both equally i promise 😭😭
nba,not_removed,what is the crowd chanting
nba,not_removed,wow ainge got old and whys bill murray sitting beside him
nba,not_removed,did dwight do something to make horford pull his arm down i assume yes i rmember in the playoffs dwight ate him for breakfast
nba,not_removed,dwight pushed him and immediately walked away smh
nba,not_removed,al horford didnt get suckered into the dirtiness that dwight was pulling and instead used it as an opportunity to pump up the home crowd one big reason danny ainge preferred to sign horford to howard being a culturefirst guy is very important to the celtics org
nba,not_removed,yeah it wasnt a play on the ball horford got tired of getting bodied like that so he deliberately fouled dwight
nba,not_removed,it was a response to the play right before on it dwight pulled it down and they just called it a common foul
nba,not_removed,well at least there was a reason dwight shoved him these celtics announcers are terrible keep quiet when horford pulls dwight down talks when dwight shoves horford shoutout to dennis the peacemaker lolz
nba,not_removed,fairly certain he did get cheers for that
nba,not_removed,you suck
nba,not_removed,he got fouled and pulled down because he had been making al his bitch all night he had to be like bro play ball dont be a bitch he wasnt trying to start a fight over a hard foul but he cant let al think hes anything but dwights bitch because he was all night
nba,not_removed,are you a lowkey celtics fan not asking in an insulting manner just curious
nba,not_removed,stop kid it was a little glancing push that horford just exaggerated and then overreacted to stir up the moment
nba,not_removed,he literally dragged dwights arm down
nba,not_removed,looked like a punk ass move to me of course howard is going to take offense to it
nba,not_removed,these two plays were a sequence wasnt about him being bodied so much as it
nba,not_removed,are you saying it should have been a flagrant
nba,not_removed,boston fans smh
nba,not_removed,must be to horford because he got outrebounded by his point guard
nba,not_removed,username says heat fan flair says sixers fan comment says celtics fan this guy is really something
nba,not_removed,dwight did this exact play on it the possession before with worse results
nba,not_removed,dwight did this exact play to it the possession before and was smiling and acting like he did nothing wrong
nba,not_removed,cause dwight had a punk ass move to it right before it
nba,not_removed,damn dwight you could have just picked it up as he was going by rather than yanking the little guy around
nba,not_removed,if it falls i thinks thats a flagrant no play in the ball
nba,not_removed,im biased but the it play before was up in the neck area and had no play on the ball too thats at least a flagrant imo considering the flagrant that it got in the toronto game i have no idea how it wasnt
nba,not_removed,supporting our players during a heated game idiots
nba,not_removed,if i only saw the video up until the push saw the box score and read the comments id actually believe they were saying it to him
nba,not_removed,you hawks fans are so salty he left your mediocre for decades team
nba,not_removed,he used to troll sixers fans hard months ago when he had a heat flair then adopted the sixers flair and immediately stopped weird dude
nba,not_removed,definitely not worse results unless it is blaming his because of that foul
nba,not_removed,dwight did this exact play to it so youre saying dwight threw it to the ground like horford did to him
nba,not_removed,no way horf grabbed him hard and threw him down dwight just kind of gently wrapped it up theres a reason it wasnt mad at all
nba,not_removed,well then i did not catch the game punk ass move by both players
nba,not_removed,thats true no doubt if it fell itd have been a flagrant at the same time though ive seen countless plays like this one proceed similarly if the defender keeps the opponent upright even if its clearly not a play on the ball the refs dont bat an eye even commentators say shit like good defense dont allow easy baskets wrap him up etc etc i mean this exact type of foul has happened to lebron a thousand times its just they way things are
nba,not_removed,the dude was getting abused all night frustratingly fouled dwight who made him his bitch then took a one handed push and flew back then wanted applause lol and bostons fans are stupid enough to do it hopefully next time they tell him to grab a rebound and play some defense lol
nba,not_removed,at least we can win a playoff series
nba,not_removed,but yet we still beat you in the playoffs 🤔
nba,not_removed,why would i be salty for someone who gets outrebounded by their midget poiint guard we got dwight howard for fucks sake and we just blew you guys out at home by points why the fuck would i be salty lmfao
nba,not_removed,hes crying out for attention and you people are giving it to him lol
nba,not_removed,well it is worse if the refs have to watch the replay and everyone watching the game thought it was a flagrant or
nba,not_removed,the horford foul wasnt a flagrant right do you think it shouldve been
nba,not_removed,the cheers were for dwight getting a technical and horford used the tension to rile the crowd up pretty basic stuff have you guys considered telling your team the defense bit maybe your defrtg could climb above the knicks timberwolves and kings in the rankings might even avoid losing games
nba,not_removed,the fans cheered not only because al wanted them too but it was also against his former team he seemed like a man with no regrets out there and that action signified that he is one of us now it would be a shitty move by the fans to not cheer him on did you expect the fans to boo him fans are supposed to support their teams players no matter what
nba,not_removed,ah yes i forgot about all of those series winning rings the league gives out you guys must have a ton of series winning rings good for you
nba,not_removed,yeaand of our starters were out because of injury also we need to stop giving a shit about who beat who in the playoffs it really doesnt matter you either win a ring or you dont there are no place prizes
nba,not_removed,you guys were ready to blow al better than his hot wife until he decided to leave
nba,not_removed,again boston fans smh has there ever been a flagrant two called where the guy stayed on his feet lol dwight just wrapped up horford tried to pull dwight down horford is a bitch always will be one i also think hes against lebron in the playoffs lol what a little bitch
nba,not_removed,maybe but im not mad about it being a common foul definitely was harder than the one on it though
nba,not_removed,i love how boston fans can get riled up by someone playing like a bitch and getting completely destroyed maybe you should sit at center court and get ass reamed by dwight and then pump the crowd up too after he blows his load on your face boston fans would prolly lose their shit
nba,not_removed,well he shouldnt have any regrets only boston should seeing dwight treat him like a three cent hooker all night youd think the fans would be like uh can you please just step up your game instead of act like a bitch
nba,not_removed,just saying you shouldnt talk trash when your team hasnt won anything meaningful in years
nba,not_removed,if the celtics beat the hawks you would be bragging about it to hawks fans for years lol
nba,not_removed,so the dude was always a problem because he couldnt rebound we always hated that about him sure he was a really good player but ever since his injury hes had problems the guy is past his prime and yor fans are starting to see that stop being delusional
nba,not_removed,nice fanfic
nba,not_removed,hey jackass it was because he mugged it right before and only got a common foul howard got what was coming to him
nba,not_removed,youre an idiot
nba,not_removed,oh so when was the last time the hawks won an ecf or won a championship because aside from those things everything else in meaningless
nba,not_removed,this man tells the truth
nba,not_removed,celtics fans dont give a shit about meaningless victories we know what its like to win championships and we know what its like to los the championships in game playoff moral victories without a ring means nothing to us
nba,not_removed,i just cant believe some bitch is and i was replying to you saying flagrant two lol what a bitch you are too
nba,not_removed,lmao yall are soft as hell if you think that was a mugging it wasnt even mad about it
nba,not_removed,it mugged himself
nba,not_removed,nuh uh you are
nba,not_removed,lmao celtics fans are the kings of bringing up the past pretty much every championship the celtics won was decades ago or more
nba,not_removed,we won in when did the hawks win anything last
nba,not_removed,honestly thats amazing that is his season low
nba,not_removed,shouldve rested think the rockets wouldve had the w tonight if he did
nba,not_removed,he hasnt been the same player this past week and a half after dropping consecutive point triple doubles he needs to rest we are locked into the but he cares about mvp too much
nba,not_removed,doesnt wear the freshest clothes
nba,not_removed,tonight ricky rubio had more points and assists than james harden with less turnovers
nba,not_removed,more than i can get in mycareer lmao
nba,not_removed,sad low energy
nba,not_removed,tony parker mvp
nba,not_removed,lol he lost the game for houston at the end
nba,not_removed,lil b caught up to him smh gonebutneverforgotten
nba,not_removed,it happens playing through an injury no rest he toughs it out and is doing the best he can for his team you have to respect and love that
nba,not_removed,a certain mvp candidate wouldve made sure he got his numbers in a loss
nba,not_removed,weve had a habit of shutting down the tripledub machines this season russel never came close to one against us either
nba,not_removed,westbrooks is probably somewhere around there too right
nba,not_removed,our guys are feeling it and came ready to play you sure they would have won without harden
nba,not_removed,yeah im sure those points were a bit of a hindrance
nba,not_removed,chills with the ugliest dudes
nba,not_removed,he did single handedly do that
nba,not_removed,unless it bites them in the postseason then you have to question it
nba,not_removed,yeah like i said just thought it was crazy that this is his season low and only his second game with
nba,not_removed,really man they both try for number and russ has had bad nights on losses before to
nba,not_removed,tony parker
nba,not_removed,other than the help side d we dont over help and we ball hawk for steals when we deem a perimeter player overpenetrates we let volume scorers score but we try to minimize easy dump off feeds and kick out
nba,not_removed,dude i dont know why you got downvoted so much for just asking a question haha
nba,not_removed,westbrook season low is since you were so desperate to bring him up someones a little insecure about harden i guess
nba,not_removed,he had on shots didnt get to the ft line that much either so his ts wasnt great this game had a plus minus and a poor astto ratio with respectively you watch the game
nba,not_removed,eats at the dirtiest slop shops
nba,not_removed,hes won us more than i could ask for so i dont care every star has lost games for their team before
nba,not_removed,yikes
nba,not_removed,oh no i have nothing against the post just saying that he is trying his best
nba,not_removed,when did i mention westbrook but since you brought him up he absolutely hunts numbers harden doesnt
nba,not_removed,smh this sub sometimes im genuinely curious its not like im trying to rip on westbrook
nba,not_removed,so let me get this straight because james harden only got to the line times was slightly inefficient by his standards and he had to were better off without him delete your account
nba,not_removed,turns the ball over on the dopest possessions
nba,not_removed,dude doesnt get the mvp and that wrist lingers into the playoffs and it suddenly seems more foolhardy than brave
nba,not_removed,agreed he sure is good
nba,not_removed,dude wtf you obviously are talking about westbrook and pretend like you are not
nba,not_removed,a certain nba city lost their team and is unlikely to get another one in the near future
nba,not_removed,so who were you talking about then
nba,not_removed,not sure tbh but its probably in the same area of or edit nvm im wrong someone below said that its
nba,not_removed,prob because it was only brought up because the person had an okc flair if hed had a kings flair no one would have responded abo westbrook
nba,not_removed,for this game yes he clearly was struggling from that injury or from fatigue because james harden only got to the line times was slightly inefficient by his standards harden had a ts this game you think thats just slightly inefficient compared to his usual output thats strange also the tos arent the problem by itself its also the fact that he had only assists which presents a low astto ratio what arent you seeing exactly
nba,not_removed,sure thing mr peeinherbutt
nba,not_removed,dont disparage the good people of vancouver like that
nba,not_removed,to be fair he got ejected that game so no point holding it against both of them
nba,not_removed,well maybe a thunder fan could provide a better answer than a kings fanlets not just jump on conclusions like that
nba,not_removed,if you wouldve just left it at shouldve rested i would have agreed with you but saying we would have won without him is absurd and then backing it up by mentioning his proves you shouldnt be talking about basketball outside of youtubetwitter
nba,not_removed,i used ts and astto ratio in unison its unfortunate that you would twist my argument and imply that i just used the stat in itself has flaws and i wouldnt use it as a sole indicator of poor performance and thus i didnt what i did do was combine that with everything else and it paints a solid picture that he didnt play well this game youre being a bit dense here
nba,not_removed,i like how you said i twisted your argument when you literally changed your entire comment with an edit foh dude lol
nba,not_removed,he had on shots didnt get to the ft line that much either so his ts wasnt great this game had a plus minus and a poor astto ratio with respectively you watch the game this is literally my first reply to you unedited the edit on the reply was to add his ts which was and to further explain myself obviously i didnt change my argument anywhere
nba,not_removed,ok bro you literally changed your entire comment after i responded to it so im done w you goodnight
nba,not_removed,damn youre a dick that kinda behavior belongs on youtube and twitter tbh
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,im a dick because i dont want to have a conversation with someone who changes their entire comment after i respond to it ok
nba,not_removed,he didnt change his argument youre just a dick
nba,not_removed,what did i change you know i didnt change shit youre just saying that to create doubt all i did was add in his ts of and to quote your comment about his efficiency cut the bullshit
nba,not_removed,stop commenting to me with your alt account bro
nba,not_removed,haha now hes tryna claim im an alt account of yours what an idiot lmao
nba,not_removed,lmao youre so full of yourself like damn no one gives a shit about you no ones gonna make multiple accounts just to trash the might apocolympics get over yourself bro
nba,not_removed,you said youre done and then posted more times is your ego that frail
nba,not_removed,more personal insults on each others behalf mature bunch
nba,not_removed,yeah thats totally not your alt account but look how mad you are cause i told him i dont wanna talk to him lmao
nba,not_removed,uapocolympics oh shit weve got another alt account
nba,not_removed,i havent responded to him since i said that actually so im not sure what youre talking about
nba,not_removed,bro go to bed
nba,not_removed,i mean i think its stupid you baselessly accused him of changing his argument and then tried to take the moral high ground foh
nba,not_removed,at least youre honest
nba,not_removed,sure you dont want to insult me again first seems to be your strong suit since you have no argument as to why we would have won the game without harden the actual topic being discussed before you came in here dick riding
nba,not_removed,its not a baseless accusation i watched his comment change after i responded to it and you can see that its edited lmao
nba,not_removed,its weird cause it makes it seem like they cant comprehend that multiple people would disagree with them surely it just has to be one guy with multiple account spending time logging in and out just to downvote some random houston fan
nba,not_removed,lmao who am i dickriding the mavs fan ive never talked to before and i never said anything about whether yall wouldve won or not i just called you out for being a dick for no reason
nba,not_removed,and he explained what his edit was it reinforced his argument it didnt change it
nba,not_removed,you started calling me names for telling someone i dont want to talk to them anymore i dont know any other term for that than dick riding
nba,not_removed,i participate in these exchanges and they generally go pretty smoothly if you do not get a gift from your secret santa the first time youll be rematched with those who choose to gift to more than one person
nba,not_removed,if this was converted it might not be in today
nba,not_removed,fuckin raef lafrentz
nba,not_removed,i remember a nets game where kidd was being chased down with martin or rj trailing and kidd tried a behind the back bounce alleyoop the defender broke up the pass i remember thinking how nice that would have been if it was converted
nba,not_removed,then someone grab the ball and score then it will be converted thank you for letting us know theres still time to finish the play
nba,not_removed,holy bounce pass that would have been all over highlight reels that week
nba,not_removed,haha seriously who goes up that weak
nba,not_removed,dont blame raef hes my favorite
nba,not_removed,and then its his nuggets teammate james posey that fouled him cmon man its the rookiesophomore challenge the nuggets royally bungled the whole thing
nba,not_removed,pretty much the same reason why casey didnt play him
nba,not_removed,imo credit to the coaching staff i feel like they always add some wrinkles in the rotation or defensive tendencies to get us over the hump
nba,not_removed,theyre so deep with quality players that can adjust to anything the opposing team throws at them thats the beauty of game series you get to see squads pushed to their limits to win
nba,not_removed,the warriors are the best team ive seen with adjusting
nba,not_removed,when the pressure gets tight the warriors are simply the best in the league at responding
nba,not_removed,so we should beat them in huh
nba,not_removed,usually the team struggles from then corrects over the next few its absurd how much the warriors outscored okc from the final games okc outshot gsw from percentage wise in their three wins
nba,not_removed,golden state blackhawks
nba,not_removed,adjustments kenneh
nba,not_removed,it may take a few games but once the warriors figure you out goodnight
nba,not_removed,coach of the year you should have heard all the mad shit stephen a smith was talking about kerr after game
nba,not_removed,kerr is coty for a good reason
nba,not_removed,yep otherwise you lose
nba,not_removed,stephen a would talk shit about his mother if it would get them ratings now my mother is a dear dear friend of mine but she could not be more wrong about how to cook a meatloaf i mean cmon skip she needs to stay off the weeda
nba,not_removed,shouldve
nba,not_removed,hes on air so much during the week and hes gotta get people watching i dont know why people take him so seriously everytime he and skip are wrong eveyone trys to rub it in theres faces and call them idiots meanwhile theyre laughing all the way to the bank they do not give flying fuck
nba,not_removed,thanks
nba,not_removed,yeah that was basically what i was getting at they dont care what comes out of their mouths as long as they keep their viewership up
nba,not_removed,warriors getting wilt
nba,not_removed,warriors get wilt cavs get shaq let them fight edit this doesnt really work that well since it says they have to be as good as they were when they played for the team wilt was in his prime for the warriors and shaq was pretty bad in the cavs but if both were in their primes it would be an amazing match up
nba,not_removed,its warriors plus wilt ill bet rick barry could even talk him into shooting free throws underhand again if you can add lebron from a couple years ago to current lebron you could make a case there but warriors plus wilt is maybe the best imaginable starting five
nba,not_removed,if the sixers got prime ai right now being that they are in desperate need of a pg it would easilly be the most talent ai has ever had around him on the sixers and he took a trash team to the finals in his prime
nba,not_removed,spurs tim duncan
nba,not_removed,kareem with the bucks theyd really be end up being super long
nba,not_removed,warriors adding chamberlain and its not even close a team adding a current player and one of the best players of all time
nba,not_removed,dear land if we got stockton
nba,not_removed,one reggie miller please
nba,not_removed,gimme wilt
nba,not_removed,gs with a starting five of currythompsondurantgreenchamberlain welp
nba,not_removed,thunder if they add durant
nba,not_removed,current blazers with walton would be so much fun
nba,not_removed,spurs plus robinson duncan is another obvious one but really what we need is athleticism and speed on this team
nba,not_removed,celtics spurs bulls would all be really good
nba,not_removed,spurs getting tim duncan
nba,not_removed,easily hakeem not only is he the best player in franchise history but he would fill the void in the center position
nba,not_removed,if prime kg starts for us at pf we are a top team in the league
nba,not_removed,might not benefit the most but if we could add someone like bill russell or kevin mchale good night our rebounding and big man presence down low would be answered
nba,not_removed,the raptors could be really good if they added chris bosh him and jv would be crazy
nba,not_removed,knicks getting lebron its over
nba,not_removed,wed be better with iverson
nba,not_removed,hakeem on rockets literally gg
nba,not_removed,theres a lot we could go with zeke playing the point or dumars at the or if we just need position filled i wouldnt mind sheed or rodman coming in to play the
nba,not_removed,bulls get mj go to
nba,not_removed,can you add premiami lebron to cleveland
nba,not_removed,prime kg on the wolves can you imagine the fucking defense of a thibs coached rubio dunn wiggins kg kat
nba,not_removed,prime charlotte glen rice from three per game
nba,not_removed,thats some type of shit right there gg league
nba,not_removed,fuck that lol just the thought is fucked up
nba,not_removed,oh my god
nba,not_removed,league would get cooked
nba,not_removed,why even play
nba,not_removed,so would phili and lakers
nba,not_removed,warriors could just sign aaron carter to a playoff contract
nba,not_removed,come on i want wilt to play shaq
nba,not_removed,yes
nba,not_removed,that would be amazing
nba,not_removed,lebrons are too much for the league
nba,not_removed,the dude just needed to practice them he woulda been a fine free throw shooter if he gave a shit
nba,not_removed,his teammates werent trash they were just role players
nba,not_removed,that team would be so fucking sick
nba,not_removed,hell take all the shots simmons wont lol
nba,not_removed,um he had the and dpoy his finals fun you think rookies that have never played before are a better cast than that hell they had the coty too if we are including the staff as part of the talent come on
nba,not_removed,am i crazy for thinking id rather have a prime robinson on this current spurs team than prime duncan
nba,not_removed,that wingspan though
nba,not_removed,orgasmic
nba,not_removed,pg and reggie god damn they wouldnt be quite as good shooters as stephklay but theyd be the easts version of the splash bros especially considering how many more reggie would be shooting in todays nba
nba,not_removed,id rather take prime jermaine oneal tbh i think that team would easily be in the east
nba,not_removed,or a death lineup of curryklaybarrykdgreen barry could pass shoot from great range handle and was a passable team defensive player but i guess wilt would trumph in that case though he wasnt easy to play with barry wasnt either on the other hand
nba,not_removed,add someone like harden to the mix and you got a three peat team there
nba,not_removed,thatd be an elite big for yall dame cj and walton
nba,not_removed,theyd be the strongest front court in the league imo but their backcourt wouldnt be able to keep up with the warriors
nba,not_removed,agreed
nba,not_removed,after that thread about talking basketball with your dad i wanna see gervin go up against steph curry plus having him would take a big load off of tonys shoulders
nba,not_removed,celtics getting bird would make the ecf really exciting this year theyre already in a good position after getting horford so this would just put them head and shoulders above the raptors i dunno if jordan could carry the bulls the same way though he had a great team around him compared to what the bulls have now spurs for sure though id love to see prime timmy playing with lma and kawhi
nba,not_removed,hmm harden and the dream thatd be a sick duo
nba,not_removed,i think id take him a few years before his mvp season because it would fit the timeline of our whole team much better just imagine kg kat wiggins and lavine all entering their prime within a year or two of each other
nba,not_removed,kat and a younger kg would be hella scary
nba,not_removed,thats why you pick up bird and solve bostons no superstar question
nba,not_removed,id take kg unless you get some serious time to get russ up to speed
nba,not_removed,spurs better
nba,not_removed,i dont understand this one
nba,not_removed,can you imagine rodman and drummond sharing the frontcourt jeeesus
nba,not_removed,that roster would be such a weird one with their best players all playing wing
nba,not_removed,read it again
nba,not_removed,their team history jordan could join the bulls or old jordan could join the wizards
nba,not_removed,im dying lmao
nba,not_removed,he practiced all the timesame as shaq some people just cant shoot fts
nba,not_removed,and who showed up in the finals ai and crickets yes i do believe it would be the most talent he has had around him
nba,not_removed,but why
nba,not_removed,not at all lma is basically timmy on offense but is a liability on defense i think having robinson dominate the paint would be fantastic alongside lmas midrange shooting
nba,not_removed,yes lmao
nba,not_removed,i think what you cant overlook is that if the spurs got timmy back then he would fit right into the system now it would be lma and kawhi playing with tim like always but now tim is back to full force even if robinson had better stats in a vacuum which i disagree but you could argue the fit is way better for tim
nba,not_removed,theyd score as efficiently though whos going to stop d rob from getting his position and once hes in position whos going to contest his shot
nba,not_removed,will finally let harden relax on being the only offense and would allow him to play more defense
nba,not_removed,and dunn
nba,not_removed,kobe better
nba,not_removed,combined points rebounds
nba,not_removed,oh im a dumbass thank you for pointing that out
nba,not_removed,and who showed up in the finals mutombo was pretty good in those finals he would obviously never clamp down shaq no one could
nba,not_removed,i mean put this sixers team in the finals this year and lets see who shows up lmao as much as people like to rewrite history you dont make a finals without a solid team any thought otherwise is revisionist history
nba,not_removed,better pick and roll finisher meaning hed fit in better into a modern day motion offense also look at his stats statistically theres a very strong argument to be made that his peak was better than duncans obviously duncan has the greater career and legacy but just in a vacuum as a player i think robinson might be better for the spurs
nba,not_removed,that would be a sick frontcourt
nba,not_removed,you made no argument as to why the fit is better for tim not necessarily disagreeing but i genuinely wanna hear why you think hes a better fit than robinson robinson seems much easier to plug into modern day offenses
nba,not_removed,what defence
nba,not_removed,im not rewriting anything i watched almost every game in and trust me without iverson i dont think we would have made the playoffs let alone the seed and finals it would be like what cleveland was when lebron left except worse because they atleast had kyrie
nba,not_removed,i think that might be true for any other team but since these players have all played with tim for years they would be more used to playing with him a better version of him than a totally different player so the chemistry would be better
nba,not_removed,lets not pretend harden isnt incapable of good defense now
nba,not_removed,perhaps but ill tell you this this sixers team aint making the playoffs without iverson either and i see no chance in hell they make a finals with him
nba,not_removed,by saying match doesnt that imply that hes currently at games like that
nba,not_removed,this is actually kind of underselling him fourth straight game with at least points and at least boards
nba,not_removed,word to anthony bennett
nba,not_removed,lets see if he can make it to straight games
nba,not_removed,bust
nba,not_removed,wonder what team the wolves are going to trade him to
nba,not_removed,thats how i read it but he said straight maybe it was a typo
nba,not_removed,i think it implies that someone else in that span also had straight games of
nba,not_removed,who do they play next
nba,not_removed,wonder how the lakers will feel when they wont get paul george because they lost their pick this year will be outside the top which also loses their pick in and instead are left with paying million to mozgov and deng
nba,not_removed,jazz thatll be a tough matchup
nba,not_removed,probably worse than right now but do you have any guesses where they will ship kat off to after they fail once again to build a team around their franchise big man
nba,not_removed,yep gobert is a beast but i believe in towns
nba,not_removed,we are against the jazz this season kat put up and in those games both of those were pretty close games though wiggins really struggled in both those games as well but that was back when he was slumping a bit
nba,not_removed,this man is out for blood
nba,not_removed,fellow joint cocker james johnson approves
nba,not_removed,damn that was almost a dunk
nba,not_removed,shoein for mip
nba,not_removed,they had players operating them it was players only night after all
nba,not_removed,when the camera has to pan to follow a pass its too close
nba,not_removed,that camera angle is called mobile view on nba league pass and its horrible because you cant see everyone on the court
nba,not_removed,i was wondering if it was off putting to anyone else it can fuck right off
nba,not_removed,yeah it was annoying but i think they fixed it later
nba,not_removed,first just trying to bring back the first youtube comments that are never actually even first trying to bring that thing back
nba,not_removed,matt barnes is back
nba,not_removed,i laughed
nba,not_removed,first to comment last to get laid
nba,not_removed,i love that small beautiful bastard
nba,not_removed,if there was still any doubt whether it would be an allstar or not its been settled when lebron gives you the nod youre in
nba,not_removed,i remember when we traded for isaiah canaan it originally came out that we traded for isaiah thomas and i was pumpedbut we didnt
nba,not_removed,is there people who think he isnt a star even if he doesnt make the all star team hes still a star
nba,not_removed,works his ass off year round just like lebron does respect
nba,not_removed,game recognize game
nba,not_removed,thanks lebron
nba,not_removed,it cant be a superstar because his image to many people is still that guy that somehow can score even celtics fans dont respect him and talk about trading him a lot because he can never lead us to a ring but to me he is a superstar
nba,not_removed,bos fans still find a way to be salty over this
nba,not_removed,hes solid definitely solid
nba,not_removed,wow not a single salty kings fan wtf
nba,not_removed,idk why the kings and suns let him go in the first place
nba,not_removed,isaiah wont start but should be a starter in the allstar game
nba,not_removed,why do i find the fact that lebron was watching donnie brasco more interesting than anything else
nba,not_removed,horford snek jokes from hawk fans
nba,not_removed,fuggitaboutit
nba,not_removed,wowzers
nba,not_removed,i thought you were talking about lebron for a second
nba,not_removed,lebron the commissioner james
nba,not_removed,lebron nodded
nba,not_removed,could have tho
nba,not_removed,a lot of casual watchers dont really know him same for hayward
nba,not_removed,he was an all star last year he was always a star even before this season theres a difference between a star and a superstar
nba,not_removed,ai carried the to a finals appearance i know its not exactly the same but why cant the smallest guy on the court dominate it too
nba,not_removed,you dont know why the kings and suns let zay go httpiimgurcomelauyfojpg
nba,not_removed,the fact the suns signed him in the first place was a big surprise and made no sense i remember they where stacked with guards for no reason that yearif anything it was sac who took the bigger lbut moving to a big market with less of a shuffle to make a all star team yeah it worked out perfectly for him so im pretty sure those thoughts are long way
nba,not_removed,hard to start him after the way lowry wall and derozan have been ballin this season
nba,not_removed,just forget about it
nba,not_removed,i mean theres proof that lebron doesnt browse ratlantahawks
nba,not_removed,lebron is just all over the place recently
nba,not_removed,lebron avatar of basketball james
nba,not_removed,lebron gordon james is he going to give a speech to preserve the memory of kevin durants gooddoing
nba,not_removed,and then there was peace and all was well king james
nba,not_removed,hayward more so because of where he plays people that dont like thomas even a few boston natives dont think he can play because of his height its weird because if you watch a game any game you know hes a baller
nba,not_removed,incorrect the were a juggernaut defensive team with mutombo being dpoy and anchoring them
nba,not_removed,do you think it could be the best player on a finals winning team second best idk about anyone else but i think to be a superstar you have to be able to get there with him as your best guy
nba,not_removed,no disrespect to it who is a great player but iverson was way better than it is or will ever be
nba,not_removed,ai had swagger with him and is a worldwide star it doesnt have that appeal a lot of ais appeal also comes from his gangster fashion with the dorag and his braids that a lot of people copied and everyone wanted to be like him because his crossover was insane
nba,not_removed,the idea in theory was good we ran this twopg set in the season and won games there was a big drop off whenever either dragic or bled would come off our reserve pg was ish smith and so having it meant that we could have two all star caliber guards on the court at all times out of the minutes available at the pgsg positions you could play each guy mins the first problem was that this caused a logjam at sf because we had tucker green and warren all fighting for minutes this meant that to get green minutes he had to slide down to the which of course meant fewer mins for it the second problem was that the twopg lineup became more of the bledsoe show with him dominating the ball and reducing dragic to a spot up guy in the corner then when it came on he would throw up shots because on a night to night basis youd never know how many minutes he would get people seem to think the season was a disaster but we were two bs buzzer beater losses away from being before goran requested a trade and the team fell apart like many things mcdonough had a plan that looked good on paper but his lack of player management caused things to go awry
nba,not_removed,and kyrie and kemba—theres a lot of good guards this year very hard to choose
nba,not_removed,lebron isaiaiaiah should be an allstar james
nba,not_removed,i hate hearing that but its so true
nba,not_removed,yeah but if ai isnt there theres no way they get that far the sixers were willed into the finals by him
nba,not_removed,i think he can if he has the right supporting cast around him a team that can spread the floor so he can run a pnr to get to the rim and dish it out to an open shooter and of course a good defensive cast around them kinda what the celtics are trying to do now although the shooters arent really reliable enough
nba,not_removed,yeah it is an excellent player but he could never be the best player on a championship team same with harden and westbrook clear cut amazing super stars but they could never lead a team to the championship as a first option
nba,not_removed,not saying it will be the next ai but maybe he can be an ai lite and carry the celtics similar to how ai carried that sixers team of course hell need more help in a really good defensive team that could also hit shots semi reliably
nba,not_removed,while he doesnt have the same appeal that ai did hes an incredibly likable guy that also doesnt mean it cant kinda fill the same role that ai was in as the main scoring option on a team that goes deep in the playoffs theres no way it can be as influential as ai was off the court but on the court he can do something similar
nba,not_removed,it is leading the east in scoring hes over better than lowry or kemba and around better than kyrie or wall yes he doesnt have the same presence on defence as them players but this is the all star game we are talking about i think its between kyrie it and derozan for the east starters but it should definitely be there
nba,not_removed,yall needa rebrand and your social media team needs to step up big time yeah yall are in utah and the odds arent in your favor but your franchise isnt even trying to be more recognizable
nba,not_removed,were willed into the finals by him okay there this isnt mythology with sisyphus he scored a lot relatively inefficiently and they won with d not o if you wanna see winning with o then see dirk and
nba,not_removed,its still yet to be proven that they cant lead a team with the way that harden and westbrook are playing i could see it happening
nba,not_removed,yeah i see what you mean but i just dont think it will ever be bestplayeronafinalsteam good
nba,not_removed,oh i thought you meant why isnt it a superstar like ai was yea it can dominate like ai
nba,not_removed,wall is better than it i think kyrie is too there are more metrics than just ppg
nba,not_removed,you really hes a pg right theres far more to it than ppg otherwise by your logic derozan lowry lol
nba,not_removed,thats kind of irrelevant
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,hes a star but not a superstar
nba,not_removed,i agree that wall is a better player actually after looking up the stats i think they are having a similar impact on the offensive end this year it being a better scorer on better efficiency in less minutes but wall has almost assists per game more so yeah the main guards should be it derozan kyrie and wall i couldnt tell you what order to put them in though
nba,not_removed,both of those statements are wrong by just about every metric it has vs and on attempts vs and he has more assists that kyrie less than wall by he has fewered turnovers than wall by and fewer than kyrie he has fewer steals than wall and about the same as kyrie less clearly the three here are comprable but it is clearly statistically better than kyrie and similar to wall but if we look at the advanced stats the case for it becomes more clear the best ts out of all by far the most win shares by far the lowest tov walls is absymal and the best per so the three are neck and neck in terms of hard stats with wall and it a bit ahead of kyrie for sure and then it clears them all out on every advanced stat that matters for a pg pretty clear case for it tbh more points the same attempts fewer turnovers similar assists and better advanced stats in every metric
nba,not_removed,i agree that id rather have kyle on my team but id rather watch derozan in the all star game it has more ppg than lowry slightly less assists but a better assisttoturnover ratio all on about mins less per game his efficiency isnt as good as lowry but he handles more of the scoring load and gets to the line about times more per game on better i also agree im always going to be biased just to watching much more it but in an all star game where there is feck all offensive sets and defence its handle and ability to finish past shotblockers and demars midrange game and dunks makes them more enjoyable to watch
nba,not_removed,nice stats id add just a few things context is important i dont know isaiahs injury history but wall started this season with a new coach revamped roster and fresh off double knee surgeryi really do think hed be playing even better if not for all these things at least isaiah and kyrie have continuity and health i think also wall shits on it defensively so while offensively it is better and not by a ton wall is a more complete player consider this how much better would the celtics be if they had wall instead of isaiah answer way better
nba,not_removed,not sure why you are getting downvoted for pointing out statistics people hate the facts i guess
nba,not_removed,the way you presented some of those stats is definitely disingenuous these three specifically it has vs and on attempts vs and okay but kyrie is shooting better kyrie has a fg compared to thomas fg shooting very similarly on compared to thomas slightly better but kyrie is shooting much better on attempts kyrie is shooting versus thomas the difference is in free throw shooting kyrie is attempting less than half as many free throws as it only per game compared to thomas while thomas is shooting better from the line versus kyries has more assists than kyrie kyrie has assists per game to thomas hardly a significant difference if you youre going to go out of your way to mention that it only has fewer steals per game than kyrie you definitely need to mention kyrie only has fewer assists per game by far the lowest tov its by far better than walls but it is not by far better than kyries though it is better only compared to kyries to your other points the best ts again that goes back to the fact that hes shooting so many free throws getting to the line is definitely a skill and he is a better free throw shooter but the fact that hes shooting so many is absolutely bringing up his ts so that is still important to mention you should also mention that it has a significantly higher usage versus kyries so its not that surprising that it would have better counting stats including advanced stats like win shares
nba,not_removed,lowry spanks him on rebounds and steals and lowrys ts is a ridiculous it at just to compare derozan is but ill give you this id still choose lowry but was definitely underrating it
nba,not_removed,wall is better than it defensively but idk if cs would be better with him we already have great guard defense in smart and bradley id rather have the o but i def will allow that i could most certainly be wrong who will know i guess
nba,not_removed,no doubt youre right on all your points i was just trying to win the argument lol i just personally like it more but the at the end of the day theyre all quite comprable and can only really be chosen on a per system basis
nba,not_removed,if lowry spanked it in assists and also has a worse assist to turnover ratio that would mean he turns the ball over a ton in reality he gets just over one assist per game more on rebounds it is not a good rebounder but he plays in the backcourt with bradley who crashes the glass on every possession also its not really a pg spot on the all star team its just any two guards the all nba teams are where you factor in defence and being a floor general
nba,not_removed,mb i meant rebounds and steals and in a nonbox measurement defense too
nba,not_removed,yes i admitted that in the very first comment youre arguing for the sake of arguing now im just saying lowry would probably be more deserving of an allnba team but less of an allstar think of allen iverson and kareem to pull an example out of my arse there is no question kareem is the better player but id rather watch ai in an allstar game
nba,not_removed,thats fair
nba,not_removed,i hate playing in portland this crowd is nuts gg blazers nurkic is good what a pickup for yall
nba,not_removed,moe harkless is underrated as fuck athletic as hell shot is improving and he can defend the and hes
nba,not_removed,trailblazers gettin spooky out here
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,blazers are now in the nurkic era actually thanks ugoonsack
nba,not_removed,that was a fun game to watch there were like a half dozen seriously chaotic sequences in crunch time harkless is solid
nba,not_removed,know it wont happen but damn another portland houston playoff series would be nice
nba,not_removed,every time nurk dunks the ball my body clenches i tingle a bit and then i feel blissful and sleepy is this nurk fever
nba,not_removed,the blazers are so hot rn
nba,not_removed,so youre telling me that the blazers got nurkic and a round pick fuck off
nba,not_removed,add the rockets to the list of teams that got murked by the nurk
nba,not_removed,trailblazers made the trade of the year in a season boogie got dealt for a rookie amazing
nba,not_removed,nurkic letting the national audience know what time it was in that postgame interview
nba,not_removed,straight wins nurkic is god
nba,not_removed,i guess we can make the post all star blazers run an annual thing now
nba,not_removed,james harden mvp
nba,not_removed,hey james youve been shooting poorly all night and were in the clutch you want to run a play for one of your teammates or something nah i think ill just shoot three contested threes in a row i dont have a messed up shot because of a wrist injury or anything right
nba,not_removed,blazers are on fire man if they hold on to that seed that series with the dubs will be fun as hell
nba,not_removed,and this is the response to the bleacher report bums putting lillard at
nba,not_removed,nurkic knows what time it is
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,nurkic murdered nene on that spin
nba,not_removed,gg blazerbros please lets rest harden now
nba,not_removed,blazers going for
nba,not_removed,that quarter scared me so much every blazer went cold until the last minutes
nba,not_removed,im telling you guys this team is for real
nba,not_removed,this team is fucking insane right now what a win
nba,not_removed,harden got shut down in the clutch
nba,not_removed,nurk behind dame in that interview was adorable
nba,not_removed,fuck this flat earth
nba,not_removed,uh oh happy learned how to putt
nba,not_removed,rip cittaaaayy
nba,not_removed,blazers are and since the nurkic trade time to jump on the bandwagon
nba,not_removed,more nurk fever
nba,not_removed,denver please get that seed
nba,not_removed,blazers won an important game against a top team upvoted party nurkle jerk commence
nba,not_removed,we are a good team now yay
nba,not_removed,red hot and rolllllllllin
nba,not_removed,nurk you adorable messiah
nba,not_removed,fuck man im not sure what harden was doing at the end literally got shut down except when he hit his first three he should have just rested all of quarter i have a feeling we would have had a better chance
nba,not_removed,were the best team in the nba
nba,not_removed,good game portland james better play limited minutes tomorrow silly to have him play minutes while injured in a game that largely didnt matter
nba,not_removed,lillard dropped on beverley isnt beverley only good for defense
nba,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomvehuckvpng
nba,not_removed,james harden with an ugly points cant argue with results tho
nba,not_removed,love yall ripcity amazing performance tonight you guys have a mean ass roster i hope yall go deep in the playoffs
nba,not_removed,man nurchic is turning into one of my favorite players first game i really saw him was the spurs game they won hes the best combination of intensity and goofiness
nba,not_removed,the blazers are on a massive run nurkic has been massive
nba,not_removed,this game solidifies andersons mvp case
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,gg blazers bros go and kick the dubs ass in the first round
nba,not_removed,them portland cheerleaders are bad af hipster chicks all the way nuggets are dumb af
nba,not_removed,nurkic prime shaq
nba,not_removed,do you want to give me an aneurism because thats how you give me an aneurism
nba,not_removed,yo the blazers just played inspiring defense nurkic fever is real havent seen harden play that tentatively all season
nba,not_removed,nurikics acquisition has made this team a lot better this guy is a beast
nba,not_removed,not a good time for harden to look like garbage
nba,not_removed,those last two minutes were hilarious houston got completely shut down
nba,not_removed,denver doesnt like this
nba,not_removed,this team is going to win games next year i could even see a game year a dominant big depth and two explosive shooters the rest of the league better watch out
nba,not_removed,man there was like three turnovers where hardens handles just failed his handles are tighter than that at least thats what i thought i think crabbe stripped him twice and there was another where he just lost control of the ball
nba,not_removed,not fun watching harden put up a effort on an injured wrist shoulda just sat
nba,not_removed,nurkic has been killing it on the offensive boards i think this blazers team is legit denver travel agents should be getting a nice boost real soon here
nba,not_removed,i am loving portland since the asg dame is a monster
nba,not_removed,i know we won and its bad form and all but i was at the game and that officiating was downright embarrassing i watched tony brothers stare at the ground while lillard was manhandled to the ground fucking up his wrist multiple ridiculously blatant wrong outofbounds calls that phantom foul on meyers strip like the only good thing he did all night etc the whole game was baffling from a ref standpoint anyone that watched on tv have an opinion am i just crazy
nba,not_removed,whats our record in sleeved jerseys now
nba,not_removed,what am i lookin at here fellas seems like there is a large mass in the center of our team that is fucking shit up and making the rest of the team fuck shit up is shit gonna keep getting fucked up
nba,not_removed,id love to see blazzers kicking some dubs ass in playoffs
nba,not_removed,portland have an impressive backcourt with lillard cj and nurkic elite addition to the roster plays great d and provides huge rim protection they shot well from the field and especially from deep and they shut down harden in the clutch really well fun team to watch and i hope they make the playoffs
nba,not_removed,holy shit we closed out a game
nba,not_removed,wow with the last minutes o
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,mo harkless clutch steals
nba,not_removed,w
nba,not_removed,players scored double digits great team win ahhhhjhhhjh
nba,not_removed,sam dekker has really fell off he was vital to our bench but playing like shit lately no more explosive putbacks or threes
nba,not_removed,man props to the blazers just a really bad stretch right now for the rockets that doesnt get any easier with the warriors later tonight
nba,not_removed,lol did you guys watch the post game interview with nurk standing behind lillard tapping his wrist then holding it to his ear
nba,not_removed,n u r k i c u r k i c
nba,not_removed,when do we start talking about harkless for dpoy
nba,not_removed,harden with his second lackluster game in a row especially in a close mvp race plus he has a tough backtoback game against the warriors tomorrow this mvp race is juicy
nba,not_removed,harden shouldnt have come back in hes obviously hurt
nba,not_removed,warriors beware
nba,not_removed,anyone have a gif of nurk goofing off during dames post game interview
nba,not_removed,nurk a lerk
nba,not_removed,👌👌👌👌
nba,not_removed,i love lillard the lizard king
nba,not_removed,harkless shaved that beard
nba,not_removed,man portland is hitting their stride at the perfect time also was hardens wrist the reason he had more turnovers than assists
nba,not_removed,harden choked that shit away when he came back in lol he had like turnovers in the final couple minutes
nba,not_removed,not gonna lie harden choked like hell
nba,not_removed,when the arent falling the rockets are a nightmare to watch
nba,not_removed,rip city
nba,not_removed,i think lillard had assists with the one to nurk at the end
nba,not_removed,we out here
nba,not_removed,i remember seeing nurkic for the first time during summer league against the lakers had no idea who he was was inept offensively but could rebound like crazy he would just volleyball it up there hoping for the best oh the places youll go
nba,not_removed,d
nba,not_removed,so many feels in that quarter so much rage for most of it then so much hype for about the last minutes
nba,not_removed,rockets wont get anywhere in the playoffs the way they are playing right now ive said it before but seriously the defense is slacking big time when you arent hitting your shots and not defending you deserve to lose if we think we can just start making our threes at any given moment in the playoffs its not going to happen defenses are going to key in on that and it seems we have no back up plan sometimes shots dont fall and thats fine but lets try going to the basket more lets pump fake at the three take few steps in and take that mid range jumper just to get us going or get our shooters some confidence i also think we are doing a mistake by not using harden in the mid range game this guy is a great shooter if hes not hitting threes let me him take couple of footers fuck
nba,not_removed,damian got to work on his passing now that he has a strong team around him that thrives on ball movement he needs to channel the general rather than the hero
nba,not_removed,why are we acting like from beyond the arc is a good thing
nba,not_removed,but muh efficiency
nba,not_removed,westbrook mvp
nba,not_removed,gg rocketbros yall gonna be scary in a couple years
nba,not_removed,what the fuck rockets
nba,not_removed,rockets can score all they want but they aint winning a championship with this defense
nba,not_removed,harden isnt mvp cause he lost to playoff team but wb is mvp for beating the magic
nba,not_removed,does dantoni rest harden tomorrow
nba,not_removed,why do the blazers do this every year slightly below average western confrence team before the all star break dame gets snubbed then they become like a top team in the league weird
nba,not_removed,james harden with fewer than assists
nba,not_removed,harden is opposite of clutchbrook
nba,not_removed,where is your mvp now
nba,not_removed,jokic in the background lmao
nba,not_removed,houston is not good all depends on shot falling and when teams play good d they almost always lose
nba,not_removed,stop playing minutes with a bum wrist you asshole
nba,not_removed,i think we just knocked james harden out of mvp lead its russells to lose now and i had james before tonight
nba,not_removed,dame is lowry west i love that dude
nba,not_removed,russ would have won that game
nba,not_removed,westbrook woulda won that shit tho
nba,not_removed,fuck this rockets team let me down so much
nba,not_removed,gg man our rivalry has been my favorite for the past few years good luck in the playoffs
nba,not_removed,the home town atmosphere is just crazy here gg man good luck on the rest of the trip
nba,not_removed,im from portland but happened to be in minneapolis tonight for the twolveslakers and watched rubio go off for the crowd was pretty happy but it was nothing like pdx granted the stakes werent the same playoff standings national tv but the rose garden is just on another level
nba,not_removed,despite his prodigious hipster beard harden was not a fan of portland tonight either rough shooting for him
nba,not_removed,nurkic trade was the trade rape of the year portland has nurkic fever and i never want a cure
nba,not_removed,close good game good run
nba,not_removed,lol i hate playing in portland we have a nba player lurking in here
nba,not_removed,hey remember this now that was nuts
nba,not_removed,and they got him for free from orlando
nba,not_removed,noah nurk moe hnnnnnnnngggggg
nba,not_removed,that dunk was fuckin slick
nba,not_removed,seriously one of my favorite blazers dude just needs to be more consistent game in and game out
nba,not_removed,im beginning to feel that im wrong about us needing one of the stud sfs from another team
nba,not_removed,favorite player until nurkic came over
nba,not_removed,he always shows up against the rockets on tnt
nba,not_removed,dude does everything defense was amazing on harden
nba,not_removed,i seriously see a younger ariza in him is it just me
nba,not_removed,i love that age is the end all of all stokedness everyone is balling and only is only something
nba,not_removed,how could you beat mo harkless
nba,not_removed,he had an awesome game tonight on both sides of the ball we have him on a very team friendly contract too
nba,not_removed,this teams a good pf away from being really interesting
nba,not_removed,haha sounds exactly like harrison barnes last year exact same description
nba,not_removed,shoutout to sju
nba,not_removed,damn i couldve sworn he was a veteran and around
nba,not_removed,dude i feel like moe harkless has been for years
nba,not_removed,by far my fav player very high ceiling
nba,not_removed,wait what when was he drafted i thought ive been singing how could you be moe harkless for like years
nba,not_removed,gonna make some noise in the playoffs i tell ya
nba,not_removed,not timberwolves spooky but skeltal spooky
nba,not_removed,naw those are just the vampires that live in the rose garden theyre mike rices bros
nba,not_removed,rrarejusufs
nba,not_removed,ive been wating all day its everything i hoped it would be
nba,not_removed,spicy
nba,not_removed,the bosnian bonis
nba,not_removed,and when wearing sleeved rip city alternate jerseys
nba,not_removed,nurkic era punctuated by them two monster dunks near the end booooooom chakalaka
nba,not_removed,against some of the best teams too
nba,not_removed,the start of an era
nba,not_removed,win pace
nba,not_removed,rip city right now looks like a top seed as constituted if together from the beginning of the season im glad were not likely to cross paths in the playoffs it might be a toss up dame just fucking kills us i was also happy to see the offseason fas bomb one less competitor still salty from the game shot but damn has olshey undone his mistakes with one masterful trade youve got picks and a bright present and future
nba,not_removed,jesus its already been games feel like i just read he got traded there last week
nba,not_removed,rockets were playing small gordon or harden at the moe is too big and fast for them punished them all night great hustle and defense
nba,not_removed,my heart could barely handle the last one
nba,not_removed,that series was one of the best ive ever seen
nba,not_removed,we just need to meet them in the wcf is all
nba,not_removed,that buzzer beater cemented damian lillards blazer legend status you could hear your neighbors down the street cheering too it was an unbelievable moment
nba,not_removed,wcf potentially
nba,not_removed,yup incubation is hours after the first symptoms you mentioned
nba,not_removed,uhh thats heroin
nba,not_removed,and the playoff spot
nba,not_removed,houston rockets clicks pen you just made the list
nba,not_removed,merked likelike angela merkel
nba,not_removed,nah dude they got nurked
nba,not_removed,yah we got super dooper murked nurked
nba,not_removed,i also choose to believe that olshey merely pretended to be nearing a trade for jahlil okafor as a bluff to encourage denver to trade nurk and a first rounder pick because the possible reality of okafor instead of nurkic on the blazers is nightmare inducing
nba,not_removed,right anyone who says otherwise isnt paying attention
nba,not_removed,agreed
nba,not_removed,not just any rookie tho hof rookie
nba,not_removed,nurkic is love nurkic is life
nba,not_removed,death taxes spurs winning bulls winning on tnt blazers going on a post all star run
nba,not_removed,a lot of it has to do with the tough road schedule to start the season these past two years we then have a more home happy schedule post all star break hence looking better as a team haha
nba,not_removed,a lot of it has to do with the tough road schedule to start the season these past two years we then have a more home happy schedule post all star break hence looking better as a team haha
nba,not_removed,hes really gotta pick it up for these last few games or westbrook is going to win mvp id actually advocate for resting him so his wrist heals properly mvp dont mean shit compared to playoff success you have a several game lead over the jazz so the seed isnt in contention and seed is out of reach
nba,not_removed,let westbrook win it just get the team especially harden healthy
nba,not_removed,i hate how reactionary the mvp race is it should be about the entire game season not the last two weeks either case could favor westbrook but i just have a feeling the media wants to react more to these last few games because they have so much internal conflict of who to give it to
nba,not_removed,you think his mvp chances would have been better had he sat these couple games
nba,not_removed,honestly i was getting worried hed hurt his wrist more i know he has his pride but he needs to swallow that and sit out youre guaranteed for the playoffs no reason to have harden miss them because of an avoidable injury
nba,not_removed,the worst thing to happen to houston was when harden immediately hit a after taking off the tape on his wrist
nba,not_removed,like i know rationally we cant win the series but it would be fun to watch nurk go to work on zaza for a few games
nba,not_removed,looks like colt lyerla
nba,not_removed,from the in the that was scary
nba,not_removed,when searching for a blazers game thread i usually just skip to the page cos thats where itll be at
nba,not_removed,yeah took me so long to find it no love man
nba,not_removed,yes sir
nba,not_removed,tell me again
nba,not_removed,i dont think he likes portland much
nba,not_removed,i havent been watching but that sounds like injury his shooting seems off wonder if he plays tomorrow rough sequence blazers then away at gsw
nba,not_removed,he got chilled by the hottest dude nurkic
nba,not_removed,harden was outplayed by damian best pg lillard
nba,not_removed,crabbe and moe were excellent on defense down the stretch that steal and block were huge
nba,not_removed,and thats what exactly happened turnovers and like threes missed in a row when they were just jacked up asap when we could have got a way better play game was tied at
nba,not_removed,he wasnt shut down as much as he was just forcing poor shots and trying to be the hero i think he feels the mvp heat and is tried to play hero ball but thats not game jacking up and whatnot he needs to drive to the hoop and create for others
nba,not_removed,kinda shut himself down with dumb turnovers shouldve rested today
nba,not_removed,he jogged the last min of the game
nba,not_removed,i used to be a vocal crabbe hater but hes won me over with this last game stretch im so excited for next year we have first rounders in this draft olshey is a wizard and our young guys are stepping up lets fucking go
nba,not_removed,he really should have been driving and drawing fouls in his usual manner instead of jacking
nba,not_removed,dick as big as the eifel tower
nba,not_removed,they traded away the
nba,not_removed,lol you dont want your first series to be just a lil bit more spicy p
nba,not_removed,lou was doing well at the end there too
nba,not_removed,i mean beverley absolutely smothered cj i hadnt seen that great of defense on cj in a while hes still really good
nba,not_removed,meh lillard has always had his number it always seems like dame gets into his head and he starts going into extracurricular stuff against us and ends up fouling out
nba,not_removed,beverley is a good shooter and rebounder he got lit up tonight though
nba,not_removed,corner threes and defense yes dont forget passion he brings every night but he can be a little inconsistent in the other departments
nba,not_removed,also for being a bitch
nba,not_removed,curry nearly had a triple double on him just look at the game logs and youll see various pgs lighting him up even a double double by jameer hes still good but i think rockets fans are really overrating him if they think hes allnba defense ariza and capela have better win shares than and i actually think theyre more important to the rockets defense if people are going argue thats because theyre using pick and rolls to get him off the point guard and exploit harden then teams are consistently doing that well and the rockets are not doing anything about it if bev is not stopping anyone then what is the point of discussing him as an elite defender that defeats the whole purpose so either harden is extremly terrible or bev is overrated as a defender there are several perimeter defenders who are ahead of him that includes his teammate ariza
nba,not_removed,nurkic bout to put up some stats against gsw
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,its cool we waiting stay toasty
nba,not_removed,the result was an l we made a huge comeback partly with harden on the bench lou williams was carrying in the if harden either sat out for rest or tried to drive and distribute more at the end we would have been in much better position to win i get what youre saying that a bad game from harden is still but he was a huge reason the rockets fell flat during the last min
nba,not_removed,all from flops
nba,not_removed,nurchich
nba,not_removed,is that some kind of big bosnian torchic
nba,not_removed,massive
nba,not_removed,well they did get tickets to the game
nba,not_removed,we dont have another big that cant shoot ariza playing the and dekker getting minutes is not ideal
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,midvpm
nba,not_removed,hipster chicks jersey girls
nba,not_removed,most excellent timing from my perspective
nba,not_removed,he didnt he was playing with a clearly hurt wrist i was there watching him valiant effort from him given the obvious discomfortpain
nba,not_removed,they really collapsed there plus theyve got gsw tomorrow night tough stretch
nba,not_removed,and three first round picks
nba,not_removed,we need a back up big right now meyers is struggling with injury and confidence issues and his ball is now a gimmick if he can learn to operate in the low post more and only hit the odd well be in a better position otherwise i am expecting olshey to get a big to back up nurkic in the draft were on a good run but too far away to tell if we can keep this energy up for a whole season
nba,not_removed,the only reason it isnt being brought up is because the team getting screwed by the majority of the calls won the game it was pretty pathetic though i could hear how loud the crowd was booing from my tv as soon as i heard tony brothers was reffing i knew we were in for some shit
nba,not_removed,youre not crazy i was at the game too and spent a good part of that first quarter yelling at tony we had some other people in our row in on it too there were some rockets fans sitting in front of us and i think we made their night just a little bit more disappointing
nba,not_removed,hes gonna be busy the next week with cavs lowlights
nba,not_removed,if and in a point loss qualifies for low lights i guess ill take it terrible shooting night though he needs to rest his wrist but just refuses to do so kinda stupid but he is gunning for mvp
nba,not_removed,harden incoming lowlights
nba,not_removed,damn turnovers if anyone thinks the points and wrist injury should offset that let me know if not ill make it though i might not be able to get to post it until saturday
nba,not_removed,me fucking too man me fucking too
nba,not_removed,hes been off for over two months at this point
nba,not_removed,i love moe but cmon man leonard and gobert are farrrrrrrrrrrrr better defensive players
nba,not_removed,not yet hes almost there aminu his main contender
nba,not_removed,its crazy that he got and its considered a lackluster game from him
nba,not_removed,harden is injured though so it isnt like he is just slumping
nba,not_removed,getting nurk our season if we had him since the beginning of the season i honestly think we would be sitting at or seed
nba,not_removed,but ames haren lmao
nba,not_removed,b a d s h o t s e l e c t i o n
nba,not_removed,be quiet
nba,not_removed,some of the most open ive ever seen
nba,not_removed,bad harden is still pretty fucking good
nba,not_removed,were definitely playing at a playoff level right now too fighting for that last spot
nba,not_removed,weve had the thunders number though no triple doubles for russ against us either we let him score but thats it
nba,not_removed,yeah mainly because we missed so many open as well and harden was just like fuck it lets jack up because team cant shoot right now
nba,not_removed,harden lost his team the game westbrook won his team the game
nba,not_removed,obviously nurkic has a lot to do with this this time around completely different team with him
nba,not_removed,sitting with best record in the league still let me know next time yall play a bottom two eastern team again i love ot games
nba,not_removed,you saw that too lol
nba,not_removed,thats some overreactionary bs wb had a bunch of doodoos just two weeks ago
nba,not_removed,one game knocks him out of mvp contention i guess youll change your vote back the next time russ shoots poorly then
nba,not_removed,reactionary as hell
nba,not_removed,good thing your bitchass dont got a vote
nba,not_removed,i get that its a compliment but nah hes damian lillard
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,actually no we just lost to the blazers twice earlier this month
nba,not_removed,lol we beat russ when he put up
nba,not_removed,if they were the second worst team in the east maybe
nba,not_removed,he barely beat the magic
nba,not_removed,lol we would have beat westbrook and co and it wouldnt have even been close weve already been through this
nba,not_removed,how quickly we forget last season
nba,not_removed,bye bitch we ride or die out here
nba,not_removed,look at it this way we shot completely awful for the vast majority of the game far and away our best player is obviously playing injured to his damn shooting hand no less we are missing our starting pf who is vital to our offense this game really didnt matter to us but meanwhile portland is fighting for their playoff life and we still had the game tied with a couple of minutes left relax
nba,not_removed,there arent many times that i yell at the tv as hard as i did tonight
nba,not_removed,its unfortunate that hes got a lingering wrist injury but hes refusing to let it heal a strong home crowd was the last thing he needed
nba,not_removed,not without that first round pick we got lol
nba,not_removed,we got nurkić for free as well edit though he will be a max player after next year which is fine just want people to be aware
nba,not_removed,cj dame core is young af
nba,not_removed,youngest team in the nba after the jusuf nurkic trade
nba,not_removed,moe harkless is only it feels likes hes been playing forever
nba,not_removed,more than that it turned momentum we missed nine in a row in the quarter and we had the composure to give it to harkless and trust hed drive on harden won us the game imo we lose this game earlier in the year big time
nba,not_removed,anyone got a vid of that
nba,not_removed,yeah the nurkic trade really just made me realize that he was the missing piece im cool with letting this thing ride out the next couple seasons we really have no idea how good we can be with the nurkic effect having his presence both defensively and offensively in the post has opened up things up for the rest of our team
nba,not_removed,before the nirkic trade id argue to the death that harkless was the blazers third best player
nba,not_removed,our improvements now need to come from the bench specifically our back up bigs we cant have meyers as our answer for this our defense becomes shit when he comes in would love a solid vet to back us up im not sure ed is the answer for that when he comes back but he may be
nba,not_removed,george and butler would be nice but if nurkic too can blossom into allstar caliber seems like crabbeharklessaminu should suffice turners production for his is awful though i doubt anyone wants him either ugh
nba,not_removed,hey theres definitely enough love to go around
nba,not_removed,he had hardens number that game
nba,not_removed,defintely good defender and athletic as hell moe needs to keep improving his jumper but hes taken a big step forward this season with starter minutes
nba,not_removed,hopefully not as dirty
nba,not_removed,nah thats a good comparison looking at the raw numbers ariza didnt really become an elite point shooter until years in the league he was an athletic defender early on harkless could become that for sure
nba,not_removed,eh kinda barnes is a much better shooter but harkless defends better
nba,not_removed,yeah we might win two games
nba,not_removed,wtf this is actually a subreddit
nba,not_removed,after all my hard work this morning too
nba,not_removed,i cant look away
nba,not_removed,i like this this could stick
nba,not_removed,at this point im on board with sleeves for portland id be down with parachute pants if they brought us wins
nba,not_removed,pretty bummed those jerseys are getting the boot next season the sleeved ones at least
nba,not_removed,we eat at the chillest teams
nba,not_removed,im still recovering as well i got to see those first two lma point games at spirit of that was a lot of fun
nba,not_removed,so many ots
nba,not_removed,my heart had to be replaced i still remember that moment so well just telling my dad dont let lillard touch the ball and were fine as soon as he released it i felt it in my soul
nba,not_removed,i dont want my heart broken again
nba,not_removed,and theres only one cure
nba,not_removed,and this is why we win the trade
nba,not_removed,rejecting invoices for all the damage hes doing
nba,not_removed,murked noun to be badly defeated at something
nba,not_removed,silly ol me was pining for nerlens noel hard to say out of any of the big men on the trade block that theyd be fitting in as well as nurk has on this team
nba,not_removed,yeah def but only because of the first round draft pick talk about highway robbery
nba,not_removed,haha i actually do really like hield tho get someone like hinkie in the front office and watch out for sac
nba,not_removed,id marry him but his girlfriend would probably shank me
nba,not_removed,shit ill take it maybe we can one day reach arsenallevels of being the seed all the time but a postall star run isnt bad to be known for
nba,not_removed,that and dame getting shafted for the allstar game and just being like fuck that im tearing it up the rest of the season
nba,not_removed,yeah see how well that goes over for him hey james we know you want the most prestigious individual award in the game of basketball but lets rest you so that we might be able to beat the spurs and warriors
nba,not_removed,i think you guys can actually go somewhere in the playoffs too okc would have to get lucky to hit the second round so i agree
nba,not_removed,yea i agree
nba,not_removed,the race is really close so these last few games actually matter a lot
nba,not_removed,harden was phenomenal last week i just hope voters arent as reactionary as rnba
nba,not_removed,if he doesnt rest that phoenix gamw where we could give him a full days im gonna be pissed
nba,not_removed,we really need to nurk to be in better shape because if we do make the playoffs wed honestly need to design our offense to run through him hes a matchup fuckin nightmare for the warriors
nba,not_removed,cant is a strong word
nba,not_removed,i didnt expect to ever see that name on this sub
nba,not_removed,we had points in the quarter with like to go
nba,not_removed,aint nobody got time for that i just search blazers and sort by new
nba,not_removed,dj khaled voice we da best
nba,not_removed,he has a history of duds against us
nba,not_removed,he has the beard for portland but he never has a good time there
nba,not_removed,well nurk is pretty jacked
nba,not_removed,harden team allnba vs damian lillard on call allstar
nba,not_removed,it wasnt that they ranked him that made me mad it was that he was behind conley and irving was personally dame is for me behind the big paul lowry and wall irving and thomas are right there too i think you can justify any order for those three damians and kyries numbers are just soooo much better than conleys and since nurkic went to portland its shown his defensive woes were far overblown complete joke
nba,not_removed,shooting from its pretty clear hes chasing westbrooks stats all of them
nba,not_removed,hes also very obviously hurt if you ask me he should sit some games
nba,not_removed,yeah he really just jacked up threes in the last two minutes and it just didnt look good he didnt get shut down at all he had pretty decent space but couldnt convert
nba,not_removed,yeah i was surprised he came back in after taking the wrapping off should just rest and heal
nba,not_removed,guess whos team also lost to the blazers times
nba,not_removed,he lost to a playoff team wb went to overtime with the second worst team in the east
nba,not_removed,there is salt flowing through my veins
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,tbh i think you guys should rest him its not like youre going to do better than the third seed or slip to the fourth he just looked banged up imo
nba,not_removed,big if massive
nba,not_removed,howd they get tickets
nba,not_removed,i think he was complimenting the portland cheerleaders
nba,not_removed,very good chance to get at least one key bench piece out of those all that we need now is for vonleh to take the next step of being a straight up legit starting pf
nba,not_removed,lol hes backed up with them
nba,not_removed,will that be the highest scoring lowlights of all time
nba,not_removed,good lord fg
nba,not_removed,id say still post it but dont make it a priority because he is injured
nba,not_removed,dont do this to us fam please
nba,not_removed,i dont know bur hes shooting way too much while having his wrist injury ir doesnt seem like such a smart thing
nba,not_removed,damn maybe we shouldve traded him had a lot of interest
nba,not_removed,meyers defensive legend
nba,not_removed,httpimgurcomagdvgg
nba,not_removed,its really not if you look a tiny bit beyond those stats and see his three point shooting tos and terrible play in the clutch on that efficiency its a bad game for most players in the league
nba,not_removed,totally and i will admit that i used that term off the eye test looking at the box score though he was also from the field and had turnovers
nba,not_removed,i just wonder how much the voters will take that into account
nba,not_removed,wins would be a possibility
nba,not_removed,you realize thats westbrook every night right
nba,not_removed,its not overreactionary at all the race is just that close and could change over the next games for sure
nba,not_removed,i should have said the lead sorry russ is in the lead currently but its still close
nba,not_removed,nah its a very close race and could change the lead easily over the next few games
nba,not_removed,you houston fellas are salty about my opinion regarding something that can change multiple times over the next week lol
nba,not_removed,you guys dont watch a lot of east basketball do you kl actually has been slightly better than dame the past season by nearly any metric
nba,not_removed,not like he beat the current top seed in the east the spurs and the jazz or anything dude dropped and hit the game winner vs boston at the garden not like he only feasts on bad teams
nba,not_removed,congrats on the spot
nba,not_removed,real talk
nba,not_removed,see you there
nba,not_removed,deal
nba,not_removed,as long as lillard gets another buzzer beater lol
nba,not_removed,i respect you guys as fans but i cannot sit through another mins of rocket basketball really grinds my damn gears
nba,not_removed,we got a better player on his rookie contract for mason plumee who we probably wouldve had to let walk the pick was the icing on the cake man olshey is a wizard
nba,not_removed,thats not true we were also forced to swallow a first round pick
nba,not_removed,and lillard thanks again brooklyn
nba,not_removed,more like we got paid to take him that round pick doe
nba,not_removed,and hes
nba,not_removed,nurkic is a bosssss i love that dude hes got swagger and passion seems like hes already a fan favourite in the city its a shame that he didnt work out in denver with jokic but seeing as portland is probably my favourite west team i wish the best for him and rest of the blazers squad well see you in the finals one of these days
nba,not_removed,youngest roster in the league everyone is young af
nba,not_removed,crabbe aminu turner so our top eight players are years old itd be even neater if aminu was a year older so everyone would be exactly one year apart
nba,not_removed,dame is only fuck i thought he was like when he knocked us out of the playoffs a few years ago
nba,not_removed,i would like this video as well
nba,not_removed,and nurkic is only you gotta think he will only continue to develop and get better with more experience which is really exciting for blazers fans
nba,not_removed,we really need a better bench though
nba,not_removed,i agree i hope he continues to improve his shooting
nba,not_removed,thats not the broom im looking for
nba,not_removed,rrareterrys
nba,not_removed,its mostly lol
nba,not_removed,atl arent the only memers around these parts
nba,not_removed,say whaaaaa
nba,not_removed,what they are
nba,not_removed,the only game i dont want to talk about was that pelicans game
nba,not_removed,the chillest food carts
nba,not_removed,we wear the hottest dudes
nba,not_removed,peak of lamarcus career right there followed by the handing of the torch to dame in game dame is still on the way up la not so much though still a nice player
nba,not_removed,i had almost the exact opposite conversation with my buddy who looked like he wanted to die near the end of that game just telling him dont worry man dame will figure it out but not totally believing it myself
nba,not_removed,more nurk
nba,not_removed,verb
nba,not_removed,ie get murked son
nba,not_removed,yeah it really is the perfect fit for him and us what a time to be a blazers fan
nba,not_removed,i was too but because i thought wed have to give up too much to get nurk he tanked his value and it worked out in the best possible way for his career an eye opener for future pieces in tanking teams and should be taken into consideration if young teams want to bpa in drafts
nba,not_removed,i also wanted nerlens noel nobody thought that nurkic would be the missing piece on our team
nba,not_removed,id be pretty happy with noel too honestly lol
nba,not_removed,nerlens still isnt playing as much minutes as he will be and hasnt started much yet i still think it will gel even better than it already has next year but yeah nurkic has been the best trade for affecting this season and has been quickest to adapt plus the fact that you got him a first for plumlee a crazy
nba,not_removed,she looks hard
nba,not_removed,currys mvp not to mention the warriors winngingest season of all time was totally overshadowed by the warriors losing in the finals to the cavs
nba,not_removed,whats more important mvp or championship
nba,not_removed,depending on the matchup the second round is certainly a possibility for the thunder
nba,not_removed,i mean if we can get the jazz we got a shot of getting swept in the second round thatd be nice
nba,not_removed,yeah but i doubt harden will agree if we get blown out tomorrow and harden plays super badly then that should mean something
nba,not_removed,me too thanks
nba,not_removed,nurk is finally having fun in the nba im very confident that hes gonna work out with lillard and co in the offseason and actually come into next season ready when you know youre gonna get minutes a game i can see why youd lack motivation now hes having fun and is getting along with his teammates hes also going to be playing in a contract season i absolutely see him working his ass off in the offseason
nba,not_removed,i imagine that is the plan just hope they dont find some way to defend him
nba,not_removed,i would love to be proven wrong and stranger things have happened just saying rationally it seems highly improbable but kd struggles with his injury nobody on golden state defends nurk and we make it a series you never know step one is just lock down that eight seed
nba,not_removed,you a genius
nba,not_removed,borchers more than cancels harden out
nba,not_removed,his eating habits include dining at the finest of restaurants
nba,not_removed,i agree dont really have a problem with his being ranked i guess but i just like making fun of bleacher report hes for me personally
nba,not_removed,when nurk was on the court he didnt seem himself driving to the rim either nurk purposely played off of him to not draw fouls imo harden draws far more contact than that
nba,not_removed,the defense on him was tough his shots were contested and he was being forced into turnovers otherwise
nba,not_removed,he was turning it over when he did drive late and only had assists i think we did a pretty good job at least convincing him to jack up
nba,not_removed,true most of his i had a feeling were decent shots and could have easily gone in but its just that his turnovers at the end really finished the game for us
nba,not_removed,shouldnt have even played today
nba,not_removed,seriously
nba,not_removed,way more scared of houston in the playoffs would love to face okc feel like we could bulldoze them pretty comfortably i know portland wont get a chance to see either
nba,not_removed,yeah and all that time wb was literally attempting to carry and play hero ball like harden this game and they lost because of that as well
nba,not_removed,also seemed like his wrist was a bother tonight as a damian lillard fan i can sympathize with the frustration of nagging injuries
nba,not_removed,rnba is reactionary
nba,not_removed,oh shit forgot that mvp was based off of one game thanks for pointing that out
nba,not_removed,players on rockets are way better than players on okc tho
nba,not_removed,scalpers
nba,not_removed,probably would have to check with ubootum
nba,not_removed,and more turnovers than assists
nba,not_removed,thats like less than you would expect lol
nba,not_removed,often times players have small injuries that they try to play through maybe hes going through one
nba,not_removed,haha my thought too
nba,not_removed,also very debatable
nba,not_removed,i agree that it could change but it would take a massive win streak by okc with westbrook killing it every game and the rockets collapsing with harden either sucking or sitting out a bunch of games to get his wrist healed up
nba,not_removed,no fucking shit just like how yall were salty abput dame not making the all star game
nba,not_removed,oh boy here we go w e w l a d e w l a d
nba,not_removed,so this year weve beaten every playoff team in both conferences other than gs lac toronto and washington dame has scored in most of these recent big wins does that mean hes an mvp frontrunner
nba,not_removed,and well probably still last longer in the playoffs than okc despite having the deck stacked against us
nba,not_removed,hindsight is now it seems like a great trade back then nurkic attitude was a real concern and he was producing less than plumlee he is a diva that is the issue and that is why i do not agree with the rape comment if the trade didnt happen he would still be half assing and trying to force a trade
nba,not_removed,sounds painful
nba,not_removed,haha savage gm of the year just for that highway robbery
nba,not_removed,fuck
nba,not_removed,acronym has been born spot spare players of other teams
nba,not_removed,isnt that crazy we made the second round last year and were headed back to the playoffs yet we have the youngest team in the league and three first round draft picks this year
nba,not_removed,basketball reference tells me youre fourth youngest behind wolves thunder and sixers
nba,not_removed,aminu is only thought hes like and turner thought hes like im messed up
nba,not_removed,lillard could also have a birthday sadly this wont happen harkless and crabbe both have birthdays before aminu or lillard there will be multiple time throughout the year where we are one player off from the step ladder but unless we trade someone it cant happen i need a life
nba,not_removed,and hes quite out of shape right now while still beasting im so excited about him coming back next season with more endurance
nba,not_removed,our bench has been the best its been in awhile
nba,not_removed,last i heard yes nike said they wouldnt do sleeved jerseys theyll likely return without the sleeves though it they fucking better at least
nba,not_removed,nike is going to ban sleeved jerseys
nba,not_removed,what game
nba,not_removed,doesnt look like anything to me
nba,not_removed,i seriously wonder how loud the boos for nurk will be next year when we play the nugs
nba,not_removed,i think it was more that the historic team blew a lead to none other than a cleveland team if harden won mvp but lost in the playoffs the overshadowing wouldnt be anywhere near as harsh
nba,not_removed,after he already had an mvp and a championship the previous season not the same scenario
nba,not_removed,you cant sit a guy when hes on the verge of possibly winning his first mvp just so that you can maybe win a second round playoff series
nba,not_removed,their last game to get the record was also overshadowed by kobes final game to get
nba,not_removed,this is a different argument if houston was in the drivers seat in the west they have to go through really good teams back to back just to reach the finals if they were clearly the best team in the conference then you could make a better case for sitting him
nba,not_removed,fair enough i stand corrected
nba,not_removed,im hoping they extend him this offseason at a bit of a discount
nba,not_removed,hell destroy zaza then well throw dray at him id imagine
nba,not_removed,foul trouble
nba,not_removed,his clothing choices are very crisp to say the least
nba,not_removed,he was shooting like me in
nba,not_removed,blazers on thunder blazers blazers
nba,not_removed,id take that match up in a heartbeat
nba,not_removed,it would be better for hardens mvp campaign to sit out a few games he gets healthy doesnt have poor shooting nights due to the injury and everyone will see how important he is it sucks though that players get criticized and discounted for playing through injuries
nba,not_removed,water is wet
nba,not_removed,to be fair before the season started people thought it was even or okc was better oladipo and adams were both considered better than anyone on the rockets
nba,not_removed,feels bad man
nba,not_removed,incoming rockets fan with comparable westbrook turnover statistics
nba,not_removed,idk man possible maybe he just was playing above his skill level or the season has just wore out his body
nba,not_removed,sure is
nba,not_removed,i think hardens lead was smaller than you thought especially since some people have had westbrook in already i dont know its hard to say because the story and thunder on somewhat of an upswing while rockets have lost a couple lately and james being injured a bit puts an image in the media i dont know anything im just trying to predict the vote harden could win by a landslide due to team record idk at this point
nba,not_removed,theres a big difference between all star and mvp but sure
nba,not_removed,sightell you what someone proves me otherwise in any reasonable statistical fashion and i gild them
nba,not_removed,what does that have to do with what i said dame isnt an mvp frontrunner because hes the eighth seed and having a worse season
nba,not_removed,nugs could have just waited and got more though
nba,not_removed,we excel in growing underrated playersoutsiders look anyone on our roster has had somewhere in his career someone saying they were not good enough lillard and cj because they came from littleknown colleges nurkic was undervalued as hell in that trade moe and shabazz were practically handed to us for free aminu was told he was not worth his contract when he signed for us as crabbe was when he signed the extention we have tons and tons of chips on our shoulders and a reason to play and prove all of em wrong
nba,not_removed,in lillards case spare pick of other teams
nba,not_removed,and were headed back to the playoffs counting chickens
nba,not_removed,dont count your bakers dozen before it crosses the road
nba,not_removed,that might be i should have double checked thanks for pointing it out
nba,not_removed,et us the oldest guy on our team
nba,not_removed,ball is life
nba,not_removed,haha i was thinking of looking up their bdays myself to see if at least part of the year we can have to cool age step ladder so i guess i have slightly bit more of a life than you
nba,not_removed,i say we release lillard to make this possible
nba,not_removed,that doesnt say a whole lot lol
nba,not_removed,damn these are my favorite jerseys
nba,not_removed,sleeves have grown on me are we not getting any all my favorite jerseys are sleeved now
nba,not_removed,wait the golden state warriors blew a lead in the nba finals id forgotten that i think i just let other things distract me from the fact
nba,not_removed,yeah i dont see anyone really saying that currys regular season wasnt one of if not the best offensive seasons of all time what has changed is the perception that the warriors were potentially one of greatest teams of all time
nba,not_removed,dray is a successful defensive big precisely because there are basically no skilled powerful true left in the league hopefully nurk will get to be a consistent one of those can you imagine if dray had to guard prime shaq ewing olajuwan robinsonhell timmy
nba,not_removed,i know draymond is strong as hell but nurkic is like haha nurkic has like inches and pounds on dray
nba,not_removed,also mcgee
nba,not_removed,i love you
nba,not_removed,maybe it would be better but honestly just want him healthy as possibly for the post season
nba,not_removed,username checks out
nba,not_removed,fair enough record will definitely play a huge role in voting just as it has in the past
nba,not_removed,kl is a terrific player its just not a fair comparison they are both top tier guards cornerstone players but neither is really mvp candidate theyre both a step below so its just really even the wewlad comes from you taking your guy and cramming him into a thread about our guy to create a debate where we all just want to go damien lillard your argument is probably quantifiable accurate its just that were all wewlad i hope this makes sense
nba,not_removed,im counting those chickens mother fuckers httpsstreamablecomuimfn
nba,not_removed,before they get tied up
nba,not_removed,wow you guys really are young
nba,not_removed,i agree i like the sleeves on the rip city unis but many fans and players have been outspokenly against them portlands players are not among them arent we due for a uniform change in a few years ago someone from the organization said portland was updating their uniforms then
nba,not_removed,ermno i just came to compliment a player on my favourite west coast team i enjoy watching them both play for similar reasons im not sure where the debate lies here
nba,not_removed,yeah they teased that a change was coming and would be revealed this offseason
nba,not_removed,kl actually has been slightly better than dame the past season by nearly any metric i dunno its a postgame thread were all hyped youre probably getting unfairly downvoted for that first post but the second one is clearly a debate prompt
nba,not_removed,curry never lived up to they hype and tyson blossomed later noel and okafor seem much more ready for success maybe they cant coexist but they are solid players
nba,not_removed,your first mistake was thinking people on this sub have watched bball long enough to know youre talking about eddy curry
nba,not_removed,your title makes it seem like a on baketball game
nba,not_removed,oi stop triggering bulls fans
nba,not_removed,interesting comparison but i think that rookie okafor was significantly better than rookie curry as a matter of fact rookie okafor might have been better than curry overall
nba,not_removed,and yet they only have noel for more year before he will need to be paid a lot more it would be foolish to sell this low on okafor he has great potential and more importantly is locked up for waaaay longer
nba,not_removed,noel is obviously the better choice hes the guy that actually improved the sixers while okafor had one of the worst onoff differentials in the league only people who disagree with this are the casual type of fan who thinks ppg is the endall beall of player evaluation theres simply no space for lumbering dinosaurs in the league anymore if there was guys like greg monroe enes kanter and al jefferson would be centerpieces of the best offenses even boogie cousins for all his gaudy stats has yet to sniff the playoffs in his years the modern championship center is a guy who can protect the rim step out on a pnr without being a total liability roll hard and finish lobs at a high rate and convert free throws basically tyson chandler
nba,not_removed,wat
nba,not_removed,curry would eat the other alive literally
nba,not_removed,nowl
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,is it mainly currys fault though didnt he end up being diagnosed with a heart condition he was never able to bounce back after that
nba,not_removed,it took me a while cause obviously the first thing that comes to mind is stephen curry
nba,not_removed,i know eddy curry purely because i remember how fat he was and how much fun i had watching him on the court
nba,not_removed,i dont know curry is one of the most famous flameouts in recent nba history up there in josh smith territory where i feel like most people know his story and that at one point he was a very promising player
nba,not_removed,took me a second to remember about eddy
nba,not_removed,yeah i wouldnt be surprised if a good amount of people on this sub dont even know who eddy curry is i started watching the nba in and i barely even remember eddy curry
nba,not_removed,for those who dont remember eddy curry was lb prep to pro big man with potential but couldnt play d or rebound okafors post game is already better than peak curry but defensively they are pretty similar
nba,not_removed,this is like the time this story has been posted here
nba,not_removed,lebron for tj
nba,not_removed,yes thank you for this compelling and informative news
nba,not_removed,who says no
nba,not_removed,if portland had actually blown that game boogie wouldve had a chance to eliminate the kings himself tomorrow night honestly im kind of disappointed
nba,not_removed,vivek is still going for the seed tho
nba,not_removed,they got buddy too late into the season
nba,not_removed,next year could be great though with the young core first rounders and bogdan if he comes over i like these kings post dmc
nba,not_removed,i for one am surprised the kings didnt sneak into the playoffs this year
nba,not_removed,this makes me so sad for some reason like i just processed that the demarcus cousins era in sacramento is truly over
nba,not_removed,so why arent the knicks magic and sixers faded
nba,not_removed,i cant wait for the day people forget about this whole stretch because the kings have just finished a and everyones too busy calling me a bandwagon fan
nba,not_removed,another year another draft lottery same ol kings maybe one day things will get better
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,is is that sam hinkies music 🎺🎺🎺
nba,not_removed,how can thou fade that which has no life
nba,not_removed,fade that shit
nba,not_removed,i know that feeling
nba,not_removed,im sorry rudy
nba,not_removed,thanks
nba,not_removed,when do bandwagon flares come just so i can put the warriors flare on my shitstained toilet paper and flush it down the toilet
nba,not_removed,surprise
nba,not_removed,who could have expected such a thing
nba,not_removed,vivek
nba,not_removed,it took a while to fade the other teams
nba,not_removed,kangz
nba,not_removed,i for one am shocked
nba,not_removed,i for one am happy
nba,not_removed,aww man really thought we had a shot this year oh well maybe next season s
nba,not_removed,god damn portland ruined it for everybody
nba,not_removed,that would be rjusticeporn god dammit
nba,not_removed,someone please get word to him asap
nba,not_removed,well we were in the hunt right before the asb and boogie blockbuster id still expect to be in the race for if we had him
nba,not_removed,great minds think alike
nba,not_removed,pels v kings tomorrow is gonna be so fuckin weird
nba,not_removed,ill be totally honest i dont have an answer to that one i messaged the mods about it earlier today and they acknowledged it and thanked me for telling them about it but here we are
nba,not_removed,same maybe in year
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,looking back now the trade was smart pictures hilarious tho
nba,not_removed,wait hold up why is your flair faded
nba,not_removed,sry dont care counting unhatched chickens over here
nba,not_removed,please dont
nba,not_removed,or obviously because youre spreading fake news sad
nba,not_removed,sometimes it feels like year
nba,not_removed,yeah i guess the picture sums up most of the past decade although the trade was better than most expected
nba,not_removed,its always looked kind of faded tho it is not faded
nba,not_removed,hilariously there was actually someone on yesterdays knicks post that accused me of posting these before the elimination occurred because was still showing nonzero playoff odds he deleted that one pretty quickly though
nba,not_removed,gotcha
nba,not_removed,apparently this person wasnt capable of simple arithmetic
nba,not_removed,yeah and since he actually said it was the time i had posted one like that im guessing he was referring to the in the last days all of which were basic arithmetic
nba,not_removed,i didnt realize dude was only injuries give no fucks
nba,not_removed,whoaly whoaly whoaly
nba,not_removed,god damn and
nba,not_removed,poor poor adonyle foyle
nba,not_removed,how was he so fucking big and explosive
nba,not_removed,sucks that he couldnt retire a
nba,not_removed,drafted in straight out of high school
nba,not_removed,ive become so numb
nba,not_removed,back to back ls for the suns on national television
nba,not_removed,i have to say we treated shaq and chuck really well when they were here in phoenix as a fan base sucks that they feel the need to kick us when were down
nba,not_removed,man that sweet georgia brown kills me every single time
nba,not_removed,idk about shaq but chuck said during his famous rant how much he appreciates the suns fans and how they dont deserve this
nba,not_removed,i dont think he was shitting on the fanbase iirc he was shitting on the organization but san antonio women thats a completely different story
nba,not_removed,sucks that they feel the need to kick us when were down its in their job description the way those goofballs make fun though to me it doesnt seem mean spirited
nba,not_removed,i actually really do feel bad for your fanbase and my bad if it comes off bad like its pity but the suns are clearly one of the best franchises in nba history best win in nba history its just a shame that theyve never actually won a ring despite being so good for so long if they had a championship andor were in a different division ppl would notice them a lot more and not get as much shit i really dont understand shaq if hes shitting on phx tho
nba,not_removed,some people get hot or on fire kobe goes nuclear
nba,not_removed,i feel like baylor is one of the most frequently forgotten greats
nba,not_removed,lakers were struggling shaq was injured were like or something and kobe just went off and they finished the season like or something
nba,not_removed,kobe was insane
nba,not_removed,kobe bryant will always be my favorite basketball player
nba,not_removed,what is even crazier is when you look at the pace difference i mean wilt still beats kobe there but the were nowhere near the in term of pace he had the perfect combination of absurd talent inept teammate and the will to take every shot he was allowed to
nba,not_removed,actually kobe has done it times you forgot pts april in season and pts march of season
nba,not_removed,bruh i was on fire last week in my adult league minute games zero subs i still only scored or so i cant imagine having a point game nevertheless averaging ppg for a month
nba,not_removed,thats some aomine shit
nba,not_removed,i just cant believe jordan never did that
nba,not_removed,those were some good fucking times
nba,not_removed,my dick didnt leave my hands that whole month
nba,not_removed,and only mvp thats absolutely ridiculous
nba,not_removed,can you find the rest of kobes stats for those months apg rpg and shooting etc
nba,not_removed,lol that point game definitely upped kobes average that month still impressive as fuck though
nba,not_removed,in todays world that is a joke wow
nba,not_removed,this is calendar months only right it might be the case that there are other cases of this over a or day period that wasnt a calendar month
nba,not_removed,dont i know it this one time in my heyday i once averaged one point a game for a month at the local park we do and here makes it more comeptitive and by the end of that month iwas like daaaam boys this is some shit right here its a shame that i grew up hating kobe if he was in his prime now id be a huge laker fan dumb ass hometown
nba,not_removed,wilt averaged for a whole year once
nba,not_removed,curry came kind of close last season ppg apg rpg spg on in the month of february
nba,not_removed,didnt dame average near for a month last year
nba,not_removed,its all good but jesus christ when you look at his month to month averages and stats from those seasons you can see how inconsistent kobe was
nba,not_removed,kobe went nuclear 😥
nba,not_removed,the only person in todays nba that gets close to how hot kobe could get is klay imo klay doesnt do it nearly as often but both of them when theyre on you just cannot contain them
nba,not_removed,as long as its not the playoffs
nba,not_removed,i think there are a few reasons for that he never won a championship in a way he might even be more well known for being in the finals he was never the best player in the league at any point throughout his career he played in an era dominated by big men he doesnt have one really noteworthy accomplishment that separates him from the pack in the and bill russell has the most championships wilt scored jerry west is the logo the big o averaged a triple double for an entire season guys from this era need a noteworthy and unique accomplishment to them in order to be widely remembered he doesnt really make any public appearances at least none that have garnered much attention nationally i cant remember the last time he attended an nba game jerry west is still very much involved in the nba wilt is dead but was a largerthanlife personality when he was alive bill russell has a fairly significant trophy named after him and makes an appearance at every championship trophy ceremony the big o cant seem to keep his mouth shut when talking about current players and teams
nba,not_removed,and the fact that he played years ago should be no excuse
nba,not_removed,basically a protojordan
nba,not_removed,even as a lakers fan his yr gming the worst clipper teams overshadows his greatness
nba,not_removed,definitely but i would put clyde in that same category
nba,not_removed,your upvotes proved you wrong
nba,not_removed,if youre referring to the feb run youre absolutely correct the team was going into february and ended the year from february on kobe averaged ppg on rpg apg and spg in mpg while the lakers went during that stretch shaq only missed games but he and kobe were both playing great on the whole year kobe averaged ppg on rpg apg and spg on mpg one of his best seasons and he had a case for the mvp imo
nba,not_removed,i understand what youre saying but saying that they ended up going from losses to losses doesnt really math correctly
nba,not_removed,but according to the sub hes still not a top player of all time lol
nba,not_removed,kobe bryant is my damn idol hes so talented in so many ways hes a genius when it comes to basketball hes fluent in multiple languages which goes along with his social skills and vocabulary hes well spoken now hes got kobe inc going people can call him and ass which he was when he was younger and bring up the rape allegations all they want but you cant deny how much the man has matured over the years and you definitely cant deny the mans passion and work ethic
nba,not_removed,yep for a guy to be compared to the goat since he was and somehow be so good that by the end of his career nobody considers the comparison ridiculous is amazing of course jordan was exceptional but he didnt have a huge shadow of an obvious comparison among the alltime greats over him his whole career
nba,not_removed,kobe was able to take though
nba,not_removed,not just pace but the competition is way better now what kobe did is so much more impressive
nba,not_removed,if you take kobes ppg in and adjust it from to pace the year wilt averaged kobes adjusted ppg is
nba,not_removed,youre absolutely correct i made the changes
nba,not_removed,the pace the nba is played at is insane whole lot of athleticism
nba,not_removed,im a good not great bball player in a good for everything else not sports college in mexico itam in case someone wants to google it i take a crapton of shots and im good scoring people underestimate how hard os to score you have to shoot a lot and is tiring as fuck its out of my mind how somebody scores
nba,not_removed,my on fire games are like points assists rebounds and blocks its so hard to score that much its really amazing how people can score so much
nba,not_removed,dude yes to echo every one elses sentiment in highschool i had a few games in the high and those were days where it felt like i could hit anything and my teammates were just feeding me instead of looking to score i love advanced analytics and shit but every now and then youll read some one talk about volume scoring as if its something any one could do if they just took enough shots and you just know that person does not have any experience playing organized ball creating that many shots is nuts
nba,not_removed,my on fire game in an officiated league was like points dude i love smaller games or where i can really light it up without getting in anyone elses way
nba,not_removed,highest i ever scored in aau was had a couple more and those were when i couldnt miss
nba,not_removed,highest i ever scored was you literally feel like you have a million points i averaged one year in a mens league i played in and those games were only once a week i would be exhausted for like to days after the part that amazes me about kobe scoring that much against his peers is that he was doing it on back to back days or games in days doing that takes so much out of you
nba,not_removed,best i ever got was and i blew a layup at the end of the game
nba,not_removed,i scored point in a high school game once felt completely unstoppable i cant imagine doing that for a month against the best players in the world
nba,not_removed,i figured he had to have in his ppg season but he didnt just had a bunch of ppg months consistently what a letdown
nba,not_removed,never had teammates as awful as smush and kwame
nba,not_removed,steve nash shaqkobe
nba,not_removed,jan feb the man was a lot more efficient during these runs than he gets credit for
nba,not_removed,he still averaged points per game without it
nba,not_removed,thank you for that interesting bit of knowledge that of basketball fans do not know
nba,not_removed,with insane pace and playing more than minutes a game
nba,not_removed,and are pretty far apart in terms of scoring
nba,not_removed,while averaging assists insane
nba,not_removed,if youre talking about baylor or the big o or wilt for that matter you gotta couch those stats a bit cause theyre so abberant with the inflated pace its partly the way dribbling is officiated and its obviously unfair to compare a guy who leaked fifty years ago to athletes of today but dude had maybe it was easy to force him there
nba,not_removed,for october for november for december for january for february for march for april i wonder what could have happened in february to motivate him so much hmmm its a mystery that
nba,not_removed,hes retired not dead
nba,not_removed,soon bro
nba,not_removed,might get bashed for this but i feel kyrie has kobe glimpses in him as well especially since he can score from anywhere on the court and has insane footwork ala kobe that spurs game the blazers game and the finals game where he was for points the difference is kobe sustains hotness for entire months
nba,not_removed,klay gets that hot for half a game a game at best hes a ridiculous player but he cant keep it up for multiple games at a time not like you can expect him to but ive never seen another player since jordan that can get hot over a stretch of games like kobe could
nba,not_removed,steph has point games with close to ts
nba,not_removed,hahahah no klay is on a stacked team that loves to pass the dude can shoot the lights out yeah but with curry and dray and other great passers he doesnt need to create his own shot klay has struggled creating his own shot and his arsenal is nonexistent compared to kobes yeah the dude caught fire and hit mad threes sure so did many others shits not even comparable
nba,not_removed,you just cannot contain them you can only hope to slow them down
nba,not_removed,well for years he was the gm of the clippers maybe a horrible gm maybe it was other management that killed him maybe a bit of both thats pretty involved with the nba
nba,not_removed,of course theres a reason for it im just stating that considering that hes definitely a great player in nba history hes quite frequently forgotten
nba,not_removed,why shouldnt it be it isnt untrue that competition was a great deal worse than today
nba,not_removed,more like a demar derozan that could rebound
nba,not_removed,i wonder how much of that was due to the oẃner
nba,not_removed,thats really unfair and ilinformed elgin baylor was the on thing that franchise had going for them and aside from olawakandi baylor was pretty amazing at drafting
nba,not_removed,cylde was no where the pedigree of scorer kobe alone was hakeem is my favorite player of all time and the lakers are my favorite team from the time i was i watched plenty of both and kobe is levels higher than clyde
nba,not_removed,kobe couldnt pass and didnt do much besides score though obviously
nba,not_removed,that was also the year he came into camp at something like or so i vividly remember my friends and i struggling to recognize him from afar he later admitted he couldnt sustain the weight and its a big reason why he faltered down the stretch and forced himself to shed the weight i almost wish he wouldve stayed at that weight just paced himself better and as great as this run was lets not lose sight of the fact that shaq was more productive all year the guy basically saved the lakers from the lottery that year as their recordefficiency without him was the lowest it had been in years kobe had a case but imo tmac had a better one more productive overall and if not for shaq i think kobe ends up with a far inferior record people blame shaq for taking his time dealing with his injury but they refuse to mention how he opted for the surgery that would bring him back in time to save their season when he couldve easily opted for the surgery that fixed his toe a big divide between the was kobe disrespecting the sacrifice shaq made for the team shaq being the big baby that he was just projected that anger in ways that pissed off fans now that hes matured he mentions how differently his career could have gone had he truly fixed the toe issue phil talks about it as well and if there were ever a year for shaq to take the season off rehabbing it was the year bronmelowadebosh and the immortal darko were the cream of the crop
nba,not_removed,this sub is delusional
nba,not_removed,not that it matters for wilt comparisons
nba,not_removed,competition isnt better in any era people play against their peers with same resources nutrition and training methods edit this went from to super negative somehow
nba,not_removed,ok now adjust for minutes
nba,not_removed,youre forgetting the games go far longer in the nba due to clock stopping than a normal adult league game
nba,not_removed,ive had a couple of point game once and it pretty much felt like i took a shot every other trip down the floor if any one is wondering how i managed this join a team where you are undisputedly the best player on the team be good enough at shooting that youre classified as a shooter learn how to shoot from deep shoot with no regard for shot selection range better opportunities or your team mates hope youre having a good day
nba,not_removed,that is the point i try to make to my dumbass friends when i bring up kobe scoring in his last game i do not care if the jazz where letting him shoot the whole game simply shooting that many times at that age at that point of the season is incredible
nba,not_removed,a former semi pro player dropped one night in our mens league im literally from the middle of nowhere it blows my mind how he sustained this that season was wild and truly converted me into a kobe fan
nba,not_removed,when youre making threes it adds up faster than youd think in one of my intramural games last year i put up in the first like mins of the game with threes only ended up with but we were beating them so bad i didnt play much late in the game
nba,not_removed,right shits hard
nba,not_removed,with like lifting in between and shoot arounds and distractions staying mentally focused throughout it all congrats on those points ive been known to break thirty but never the fifties
nba,not_removed,what a scrub ftfy
nba,not_removed,i mean a ppg season jesus
nba,not_removed,im pretty sure i wont be the only who thinks that average ppg for a season months is way more impressive than average for a month but make no mistake if jordan cared enough he easily could have done it jordan could literally do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted offensively hell he would tell you what he was about to do it and then do it
nba,not_removed,also considering some of the garbage shots he took and made it makes the efficiency even more impressive
nba,not_removed,thats incredible i wasnt asking to shit on him for being inefficient im trying to compare it to currys february which i posted on this thread
nba,not_removed,i dont understand where he found the time in the game to do all that like even if youre only sitting minutes a game how do you grab rebounds and assists while scoring points without chucking
nba,not_removed,i feel like its common knowledge that during the shaq years he was incredibly efficient not as much afterwards but he definitely had those stretches where he couldnt miss
nba,not_removed,i stand corrected gg nba
nba,not_removed,and dont forget being very tall
nba,not_removed,i more mean and apg are just as impressive as ppg for a month
nba,not_removed,true but we should bear in mind he played mpg
nba,not_removed,its not fair to dismiss inflated stats imagine a future generation dismissing steph currys numbers because the pointer falls out of vogue
nba,not_removed,yea but we generally refer to retired players careers in the past tense hakeem had great foot work jordans midrange game was unreal etc doesnt mean theyre dead it just means unfortunately well never get to see it happen on an nba court again
nba,not_removed,theres a reason one of irvings first calls after the finals this year was to kobe
nba,not_removed,i remember after he hit that game winner vs the spurs and dropped he said kobe just told him to just keep his elbow facing the rim or something like that i definitely think he looks up to him and has had some kobe moments already
nba,not_removed,watching kyrie in the finals and against us in the semis was like watching kobe reincarnated his footwork is absolutely incredible
nba,not_removed,i dont think youd get bashed for that its very true i see an inner kobe in kyrie too
nba,not_removed,maybe not points hot but i would say agent zero might have been the closest besides kobe
nba,not_removed,true even the best game stretch i could find for steph this season was near the end of february
nba,not_removed,i feel like stephs kind of hot is totally unique though with the way he can start launching long threes or insane dribble combo bombs
nba,not_removed,so did many others i dont think anyone else has scored in one quarter but i guess youre the expert here
nba,not_removed,his rebounding totals were inflated because of the era if you look at his rebounding by grabbed he only grabbed that is a number pretty much in line with what kd grabs his high rebounding s were mostly a function of high possession counts rebounds per game is pretty much the same as rpg because of fast pace i dont know how people convince themselves of such idiotic statements but its really popular on this sub in he grabbed the most rebounds of anyone in the nba he was he was he was he ended up being in the for rebounds per game times in his career if his rebounding numbers were a function of high possession counts then why did basically everyone else in the league have nowhere near as many rebounds and if you want to say everything is inflated because of the era he played in then look at a stat like per which is standardized each year with the league average at baylor was either or in per for straight seasons he led the league in with a per for reference tim duncan and hakeem olajuwon never had a per of or higher in any season of their careers baylor was also in the league in points per game in seasons and was in assists per game times besides lebron he might be the best allaround player the nba has ever seen gtfo with this averaging points and rebounds is basically average because they played more possessions in the
nba,not_removed,i had no idea he was the gm of the clippers after doing a little research skimming through his wikipedia page i discovered that he filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the clippers then owned by donald sterling claiming that he was fired because of his race and age he would later drop the racial discrimination claims in the lawsuit talk about foreshadowing
nba,not_removed,it shouldnt be a reason for him to be forgotten we can watch the highlights on demand and see how ahead of his time he was
nba,not_removed,what if lebron played back then people back then still could have been studs in their day and now
nba,not_removed,thats not his fault
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,ill informed they were shit on rye before i blame mostly sterling but elgin is still associated with that old dumpster fire
nba,not_removed,you got downvoted but you were right on your assessment clyde was well behind kobe the gap is pretty huge
nba,not_removed,but i wasnt even talking about kobe
nba,not_removed,kobes passing is the most underrated aspect of his career he put up good assist numbers every year
nba,not_removed,it was unbelievable season only player i can think of that did that recently was lebron i miss kobe a pleasure to watch for many years
nba,not_removed,was this the year he had surgery during the season because he got hurt on company time so he was going to rehab on company time that surgery the one he intentionally put off so he could have a fun summer
nba,not_removed,the team absolutely would not have been a win team without shaq that year completely agreed he was what he was every year with the lakers utterly dominant i dont know if kobe was mvp but he did have a case to at least be in the discussion with the lakers coming off the three peat im not surprised shaq came back to try and make a run at though
nba,not_removed,imagine kobe wade and shaq
nba,not_removed,agreed
nba,not_removed,this sub lebron dickriders
nba,not_removed,it does because kobe was able to take them
nba,not_removed,if more people play a sport there isnt more competition imo being the best basketball player is a lot more impressive than being the best polevaulter
nba,not_removed,uhm yeah it is today there is a vastly bigger talent pool than in the that absolutely raises the overall level of play and ability of the players in the game and not just compared to the peers it is not wrong to suggest a sport evolved so much over half a century that players evolve as well
nba,not_removed,is negative because youre wrong
nba,not_removed,right and due to advancements in training nutrition health and recovery players are now better than ever youre lying to yourself if you think the team league in the is as competitive as the modern nba there is so much more talent now
nba,not_removed,you are wrong more people playing creates more competition and better trainingequipmentcoachingopportunities to play in this era creates better competition
nba,not_removed,the avg player is better now bigger stronger faster contracts are bigger even adjusted for inflation everything about it is more competitive i dont see how people cant get this through their heads playing basketball against a group that is on average taller and stronger is more difficult what a surprise
nba,not_removed,just remind them that garbage time games happen every year then ask them to point to another case of a year old scoring conversation over
nba,not_removed,the only thing is minute quarters but i still needed breaks like any normal human
nba,not_removed,i was in the too good for mens leagues too short for pro overseas category for a while
nba,not_removed,he averaged apg in the finals more than twice his career average while still scoring per i dont think kobe could have done that
nba,not_removed,he wouldve just missed it if he got his season average if i recall correctly i remember seeing stats on the score after that month and them talking about it on tsn
nba,not_removed,that doesnt really have anything to do with this thread lol if were just talking about impressive overall months theres plenty we could add sometimes its okay to just talk about scoring
nba,not_removed,playing only mpg on ts best month ever by a player
nba,not_removed,especially on
nba,not_removed,couch those stats a bit dismiss this is totally different from curry too efficiency wont go out of style
nba,not_removed,if you scale them with pace it becomes a lot more reasonable though both to the players of yesterday and tomorrow oscars triple double season looks like a westbrook line and wilt still holds half the records in the book though not as far away gone in a lot of cases
nba,not_removed,well if they move the line back five feet and there are still players who shoot over from three on shots per game that would definitely diminish stephs performance in comparison its not a matter of play style or whats in vogue its a quantifiable statistical advantage more shots more points
nba,not_removed,he did win a ring with kareem in milwaukee
nba,not_removed,you mean tim duncans not coming back
nba,not_removed,for real can i have a source on this
nba,not_removed,offensively for sure
nba,not_removed,i dont know i think kyries a better three point shooter and clearly a better ball handler than kobe ever was but anywhere from to feet you could tripleteam kobe and hed still knock down shots i dont think anyones game in the nba today is really comparable to kobes in terms of style although wiggins sometimes reminds me of baby kobe from before the afro
nba,not_removed,tmac too
nba,not_removed,steph hot and klay hot arent the same steph starts feeling himself and tries dumber and dumber shots that go in for no real reason klay just gets the ball and it goes in the hoop and there is nothing any defense can do about it its almost a confidence thing for steph but its a it doesnt matter thing for klay with his height and one of if not the fastest and cleanest releases ever
nba,not_removed,how did i at all say that are you the type of kid no body liked in school cause you made arguments up that no one made thats a terrible trait and no one would talk to you but ill bite youre wrong melo scored in a quarter so did gervin others came close so yes others can catch fire like him and better cause melo put up on only jumpers and kobe put up himself klay caught fire from hooray so does jr every so often shit jr hit or close to it once klay has never sustained it at the level that kobe or even melo has even steph is better in that regard you know why cause that dude is limited he has an awesome jumper and great d thats it he can create some times he can pull up or post a little or hit a fastbreak lane but none are good enough to be a strenght
nba,not_removed,i think he can def do it over a quarter or even a half but not over multiple games
nba,not_removed,everyone has known that sterling was a racist bigoted scumbag for a half century maybe more that guy had huge class action lawsuits over discriminatory housing practices against him in multiple decades i believe gradea asshole
nba,not_removed,simmons has a great section about him in his book he was an all timer i didnt know much about and i think bill did him justice elgin and dr j were the wright brothers of the nba
nba,not_removed,of course he shouldnt be forgotten but he played in an era with an asterisk he would probably be a great player today but obviously wouldnt be averaging through a month
nba,not_removed,yes baylor was executive of the year for christs sake guess who baylors last draft pick was deandre jordan at thats still paying off for them now isnt it you do realize that the clippers were known for having extremely talented teams but they couldnt keep players because sterling was racistcheap this isnt me his peers players everyone viewed baylor as a great executive that was hamstrung by his owner i dont think mitch kupchak could have done a better job with that situation baylor was just as good of a scoutevaluator of talent
nba,not_removed,especially considering he played his best years in the triangle offense which tends to deflate individual assist numbers after his two crazy scoring years kobe could have averaged apg if in a different system im sure
nba,not_removed,harden put up on ts this past season obviously not on the level of kobe but still puts his skill into perspective
nba,not_removed,yes he missed the first or so games after waiting to have surgery because he felt that since he got hurt during the season he should rehab during the next season he was going to have a more involved surgery that would have resulted in more time missed but got talked out of it since it wasnt necessary
nba,not_removed,thats the one iirc in his bio he talks about how he said that in anger that people didnt really know what was going on and how he was weighing his options what matters is that he chose the middle route when in retrospect he should have been out the entire year while the lakers plummeted in the standings so yeah you can blame him for taking care of his body how he saw fit given the punishment he takes its his prerogative
nba,not_removed,seriously what kind of basketball fan has the nerve to idolize the best basketball player on the planet fucking savages idiots
nba,not_removed,it doesnt because wilt wouldnt have taken any if he were teleported to the mid nba
nba,not_removed,no because competititors still spend the same time a couple hours maybe more than that i get that a pole vaulter has less competition but not at the top top pole vaulters and top basketball players still compete with each other and theyre in the gym because of each other you think renaud lavillenie spends less time than lebron on the gym theres a great article when some canadian rower who was a olympic bronze medalist talked about depression after rowing in that article he talks about how much he and his competitiors at the top worked everyday when i read that i get that if youre one of the top guys in any sport you work as much and youre as great as other top athletes in other sports also there are advancements in playing styles for basketball throughout the years mostly due to rule changes but like what would it take for bill russell to adjust to ice the pnr weeks current players athletic ability is not improved for average players it maybe improved because more players ball now but again not the great players its just looks sexier on cameras where you can see nose hairs of players and of course theres the fact that the plays are happening in the moment after it happens it looks way less impressive even a february game from this season would look less impressive to you compared to if you have watched it live
nba,not_removed,players arent themselves better the things they have access to are better unless youre suggesting humans evolve in years
nba,not_removed,competition is struggle among peers everyone in every generation has an equal struggle against their peers barring some extreme barrier segregation war
nba,not_removed,yeah with no subs minute halves we had four players and they played with five it was nuts my legs were jello by the end
nba,not_removed,jordan did even more impressive things during the regular season take for example jordan averaged points per game on shooting and he averaged assists a game and rebounds and steals nonpgs who have averaged assists per game nonforwardscenters who have averaged rebounds per game players who have scored on players who have averaged he was dominating the league in a way that would make you say needs to up their difficulty if you did it on a video game
nba,not_removed,actually kobe averaged points and assists in finals vs orlando im not sure if thats the highest assist average hes had in a finals but its the first finals that came to mind not quite but fairly close
nba,not_removed,i completely agree on that note on in just is up there with the most impressive scoring months obviously still less impressive than kobes but still very impressive
nba,not_removed,jordans last months of the season are pretty insane in march games and in april games january was no slouch either
nba,not_removed,while his team went that month has definitely gotta be in the conversation
nba,not_removed,unless they come up with even better stats and focus on those or they create some new algorithm that finds a correlation between steals in the second half and winning percentage times change
nba,not_removed,theres no doubt in my mind steph could shoot from three on at least shots a game if that happened more of his shots would be open because of the bigger area you would need to defend and he already hits over from that far out
nba,not_removed,hell always be with us in here pounds chest
nba,not_removed,tim duncan retiring is the first to really hit me in the heart im not sure why its him particularly in fact it seems strange because growing up i hated how he wasnt flashy or bouncy and i hated how he beat my eastern conference champion detroit pistons most of those pistons players retiring didnt phase me too much somehow timmy d leaving just doesnt feel right like a piece of my life officially vacated to the past and im now in a future i always imagined would never come but here i am
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i dont have the source but he has stated in multiple interviews post finals that he had to have that mamba mentality
nba,not_removed,its mostly because of the style change from the kobe was the best at that style of basketball outside of michael jordan anymore if you get a player that wants to go oneonthree anymore than once or twice a game hes going to get his ass chewed out kobe played like he felt insulted that every defensive player wasnt at least percent focused on him
nba,not_removed,kobes a lot taller and because of that his high flyer status gave him access to a different part of the game
nba,not_removed,i agree with all of that except the no real reason part that dude must have thousand hours of shooting threes under his belt
nba,not_removed,i always think this is debatable these guys ere that good with the resources available back then probably also worked a side job imagine if guys like this had the sports science of today they would be comparable and possibly better than todays greats
nba,not_removed,how does that warrant an asterisk should wilts have an asterisk
nba,not_removed,reread what i said im not disagreeing with you good or bad his name is next to of shit basketball being a tiny flake of gold nugget on top of a pile of flaming shit is still mostly a pile of flaming shit
nba,not_removed,very very good i would point out that kobes defensive numbers were much better but harden is a really talented player so i dont want to get into a big debate harden has his whole career ahead of him too how awesome is that
nba,not_removed,never knew there was a more serious longer recovery surgery option i jst remember him talking about recovering during the season since thats when he was hurt and what a dick moved it sounded like on top of not staying shape never figuring out how to shoot free throws and blaming it on one thing or another instead of fixing it and bowling people over for decades while never getting called for the charge i just never liked him as a player when he said that about the surgery it cemented for me that he was not only not serious about trying for greatness or even titles he was basically a selfish jerk turns out that last part may have been misplaced
nba,not_removed,it does because if kobe were teleported to the mid nba he wouldnt be able to take any threes hence he potentially would have scored less remember the point is there is more than one dimension on which they had different environments yes the competition levels were different but so were the rules of the game you could also talk about how zones were allowed in which make players like wilt less effective and player like kobe more so especially without hand checking
nba,not_removed,so the people who play a sport are withoutadoubt the best in the world at it no matter how many people have played it or are even aware of it there would have been very few nonamerican players in the even if the game was popular everywhere when people started playing with peach baskets were they bound to be the most talented in the world and on par talentwise with the modern nba if i invent a oneperson game that i tell no one about am i as talented at something as michael jordan i dont think your line of thinking comes very close to making sense
nba,not_removed,humans have been getting faster stronger and taller actually i remember some study on it theres a reason most centers in the were so short
nba,not_removed,check out the flynn effect its the sustained increase in intelligence or at least how we measure it its very possible that a similar thing is going on here or at least a similar effect is happening
nba,not_removed,players themselves are better players have evolved by studying the guys that came before them superstars stars roleplayers coacheseveryone is better do you think wilt would average and in todays nba what about robertson averaging a triple double this shit wont happen today its not because guys are worse than wilt and oscar and its not because they werent that good theyd just be facing much better competition throughout the league
nba,not_removed,it has nothing to do with evolution and a lot to do with availability the most obvious example of this is height in todays game a team with a footer is an oddity does such a team even exist talking like in the it was fairly rare to see a footer at all wilt chamberlain wasnt going to be notably taller if he just ate better or whatever and that goes beyond the center position as well with plenty of unathletic undersized guards and forwards from that era in the hall of fame modern players face better and more diverse competition for instance some gifted big who would have had health issues in the might be perfectly healthy today hell thats even true for guards all modern players are also well coached and theyre screened a lot better before coming into the league in the coaching wasnt as consistent as it is now you may have some players who were coached extremely well but then there were definitely others who werent coached nearly as well the average level of competition has gone way up as has the average height nutrition might be the main reason for that but that doesnt make a difference in the real tangible difference in ability in todays players nutrition and training really does more to catch up other players to the prodigies and the freaks than help the prodigies and freaks themselves dont get me wrong it definitely helps the freaks too but im saying it does more to raise the floor of the league than it does to raise the roof
nba,not_removed,players are also better because back then the top athletes would have been playing baseball or football
nba,not_removed,players arent themselves better you dont think players today are taller stronger and more athletic
nba,not_removed,no they dont there are more players in todays league they have all had better coaching and the difference between a great player and a good player is a lot less pronounced in todays league though theres always going to be a gap do you really think all the unathletic and undersized guards of the era would do well in todays league that was the competition in the that is not an equal struggle by any stretch of the imagination even if every all star of the era was an all star caliber player today the competition in the league still wouldnt be near the level of the modern league those guys were the peak of their competition but that doesnt mean their competition gave them an equal struggle to the competition the league sees now
nba,not_removed,on shooting as opposed to for jordan thats not fairly close thats a world of difference still a great finals performance of course
nba,not_removed,honestly that efficiency might make it more impressive than kobes those splits in such few minutes are absurd
nba,not_removed,youre not wrong but since were talking about elgin baylor in this analogy the future nba is full of deadeye distance shooters who can do what steph can do and better their stats would look equal or worse to stephs numbers but since theyre shooting from feet out and there are no more corner threes steph would be considered a pioneer instead of goat shooter similar to baylors case also if it matters the nba passes an alltime defender rule in this future to compensate for the extra space but he cant be inside the line unless hes guarding someone who is also within it offenders will be called with a camping violation and the penalty is two shots and ball flagrant camping will also be called and will carry the same penalty as a flagrant im not high youre high shut up
nba,not_removed,dicks out for duncan
nba,not_removed,rips open thoracic cavity where i dont see him anywhere
nba,not_removed,i dont think ill be able to take it when bron retires he isnt my favorite player or anything but when he hangs em up i will officially be old
nba,not_removed,thats really cool thanks
nba,not_removed,i totally agree great players are transcendent
nba,not_removed,i always thought it was funny for example when people say that wilt and bill russell has nobody to play against in their era when they played in the same era and played eachother
nba,not_removed,i mean yes theyd be great but theres no way that they put up the numbers that they do back then regardless championships isnt happening for any player in this era no matter how transcendent points isnt happening very often either
nba,not_removed,elgin still definitely wouldnt be putting up per game in this era though because of pace among other things also elgin wasnt a great shooter we cant say for sure that hed develop a better shot with modern sports science and we cant say for sure what effects learning how to shoot would have on his game with shooting becoming so important in todays league wed have to know these things to be sure of where he would fit in todays game on top of that he was and played forward hed be a tweener in todays league and theres no telling how that would go would he be quick enough to play the was he long enough and strong enough to play the could he play like barkley at pf possibly the most likely theres certainly successful forwards today but we cant really say he would fall into that category without being able to see him against modern competition however none of this is ever a good reason to talk shit about players from that era except bob cousy not sure if theres ever been a more overrated player but its still a good idea to take everything they accomplished with a grain of salt
nba,not_removed,yes the warriors would foul every possession to get the ball back which would never happen in todays game take kobes through quarter game if the lakers foul every possession in the just to pad his stats he could have hit but its considered unsportsmanlike and would never happen
nba,not_removed,youd be surprised how much of his career had to do with that toe phil says the injury robbed shaq of several post counters and shaq could be a funny guy but he can lose his temper and lash out publicly remember him cussing on live tv being told he was on live and then saying idgaf lol that was the shaq i loved but i can see how he would rub people the wrong way and from everything ive read and heard over the years it does sound like his toe was a sensitive subject at one point as for staying in shape he was in good shape to start his career and was in the best shape of his life in and wasnt far off that in the ensuing though obviously regressing more each year he didnt truly noticeably blow up until when he was at like or something but he blames much of that on being unable to work out due to the toe could be a load of horseshit i dont doubt he was fat and happy that year tho in he shed like since the start of of but he was still well above his ideal playing weight then he got to miami in and continued to shed the weight he was the slimmest i had seen him in awhile iirc he was around or so so its not like the guy didnt ever work on his bodyconditioning he just disagreed with some of the results players experiment with different playing weights all the time in he tacked on another lbs in response to his idea that his body couldnt absorb the hits as well personally i didnt like the logic i thought riley and shaq were in the wrong for having him go full bore for an mvp run at age or whatever he was with his mileage and playing style he shouldve been on the duncan regimen by then maybe he holds up better but as it were shaq won his title doing it his way so it only further justified his actions and he coasted yet again he came back for the title defense tacking on whatever it was so yeah he got fat again in i dont know about his phx days but he did have a resurgence there and i know when he got to cleveland they were making jokes about shaq having anorexia with how quickly he shed weight there as for the aestheticsquality of his game i always say in response that shaq gets away with stuff because defenders get away with double arm bars in the post hacks that you dont assume will influence his shots because hes so big so i think its a street and people who focus on that ignore the skill in his foot work on the blocks and his vision with cutters i miss vintage shaq because to me he made the court seem like a game of chess you had to surround shaq he truly warped the court in ways we see from curry today only from the interior
nba,not_removed,lol if you teleported prime kobe to the mid hed average a game
nba,not_removed,i should have cleared that i dont think players count for this but if you do your research youd see top players are crazily athletic andor they put the work in as much as a top player does today if you work on your oneperson game for hours youre as talented at that as mj was at basketball more competitors mean that average competitor is better so best pole vaulter wouldnt be the best pole vaulter if pole vault was as popular as basketball and best player in season wouldnt be in the nba today but that doesnt affect top players if you dont think renaud lavillenire is as good as an athlete as kevin durant you must be crazy
nba,not_removed,they werent short those heights indicate barefoot heights add at least inches to every center and i remember some study on it doesnt mean anything
nba,not_removed,im aware consider inflation bill gates has way more money than john d rockefeller ever did but relative to their era rockefeller had more therefore rockefeller was richer unless you mean richer based on who has more money athletic inflation is the same way there are probably girl sprinters nowadays who could compete with male olympians of the past but it would be foolish to contend that they are bettermore athletic in the true sense of the word
nba,not_removed,youre really not understanding his point at all and instead putting forth a strawman where did he say that wilt or oscar would average the same numbers a players success vs the competition is relative to that specific era if wilt and oscar were around today they would have the same advancements in training nutrition health and recovery to take advantage of that players do today players arent naturally better today they train different harder and have access to things like film breakdown a present day wilt and oscar would do the same if youre going to make an argument about competition it should center around the popularity of the game as such that back in wilts day some potential basketball stars didnt come to fruition because the sport wasnt as popularscouting wasnt as vast in its scope
nba,not_removed,no wilt averaging and has more to do with the pace of the game back then not a lack of competition there were more shots a game back then the competition was probably tougher because with fewer teams each team was stacked with talent wilt would not average and in this era but he would absolutely still dominate
nba,not_removed,no they have better food and training methods humans dont evolve in years
nba,not_removed,players are absolutely better now however i think wilts advantage was that he was a footer player when the average center was
nba,not_removed,sure i wont argue that jordan was clearly the better player in more ways than one but in terms of the stats you mentioned kobe did come fairly close
nba,not_removed,and if that doesnt the apg does incredible not that kobe was inefficient in his months but steph was on another level in that regard
nba,not_removed,thats right
nba,not_removed,as well as walt bellamy nate thurmond etc
nba,not_removed,the knicks were also fouling so that wilt wouldnt have an opportunity to get the ball and score ill be the first to admit that his point game was a shit show but that doesnt mean he cheated which is usually what an asterisk is used for its a good thing video of this game doesnt exist because now it can live on as a fabled legend without the public actually being able to watch that embarrassment of a game unfold
nba,not_removed,thats a strange uninformed and illogical argument youve never explained the reason why having more players play a game doesnt make the best players better why would other players magically become as great as tim duncan dirk nowitzki and hakeem olajuwon if they never picked up a basketball it also doesnt really make sense to pretend players in the tried as hard as todays players i dvr every hardwood classic game and watch what highlights i can find of old players and its very clear they didnt try on defense back then
nba,not_removed,well obviously i remember some study on it doesnt mean anything if you want to get serious but this isnt an academic debate im just talkin basketball on some website
nba,not_removed,on an off note every time rockefeller comes up the numbers are mind boggling he could literally buy a competent navy and a small country to go with it but your point would still contend that oscarwilt are still significantly better then what we see today i mean thats your opinion but i dont believe theyre an another tier with todays greats they were significantly better then their peers but this is at least somewhat independent of how good they were in comparison would you say computers today are worse then they were years ago nasas supercomputer made everything else on earth look like an abacus in comparison but does it make it better then whatever elon musk is running today even if only an order of magnitude better then a iphone vs the of times better the ones of the past were we do our best to put the players on an island and fairly compare but its all just a judgement emotion and very little actual reason on top of that your runner example doesnt hold runners run against themselves basketball players play against others worse competition arbitrary inflates stats another aside when you scale what they did in the pace they did it in it looks slightly less insane oscar turns into westbrook and wilt still owns half the record book though its much more conceivable that people could catch him anyways dont get me wrong i think theyre all time greats i just dont think its fair to prop them up because of their impact in comparison just as it isnt fair to say that their competition was dirt and theyre trash
nba,not_removed,even if they train different what youve stated might not be true that wilt and oscar would improve similar to the quality of the league there may be a threshold limit like just about everything ever has where its just not possible to see sustained increase im not saying this is true just that it could be totally agree with your statement of competition though how much has basketball grown as a sport more and more people are playing and choosing to play it a high level making the talent pool significantly more concentrated with high level talent
nba,not_removed,no he just brought up something irrelevant all i said was that the league today is more competitive the game is harder to play than it was in the there are more talented players there are more teams to play against therefore kobes high scoring games were much more impressive than wilts players are quicker stronger and smarter than they were and you guys are trying to tell me why i already know why and i said why everything else you brought up is irrelevant i am already aware that if players from the were here now theyd have access to the same resources i never said players were naturally better today or were born better than players back in the day you even quoted what i said
nba,not_removed,no one is saying anything about evolution other than you were talking about the physical condition of the athletes
nba,not_removed,humans can absolutely experience changes in the frequency of certain traits like being taller in years they arent evolving into another species theyre just becoming more athletic before you even consider all the new training and medicine
nba,not_removed,wilts advantage was that he was a great player in fact he preferred to shoot jumpers than to dunk over people you should go watch wilt chamberlain archives on youtube and see that he was a skilled basketball player rather than some guy who happened to be taller than everyone he still played against willis reed nate thurmond walt bellamy and bill russel doesnt sound like much but for an era where there were so few teams thats a lot of great centers all guys that would still play center in todays game
nba,not_removed,i did explain that maybe you struggle to get my reasoning where the hell i claimed that guys who never picked up a basketball are better than hakeem etc opposedly i argue that competition got better on average but because onwards great players in the moment have put the same work in basketball as other great players onwards top players did not improve generally so youre strawmaning hard by creating sentences that im actually opposing in the only era where nbas greatest player was the greatest because he was the greatest defender rather than the greatest offensive player or both its strange to question how important defense was it was just different you cant see pnr coverage today and ask players of to do the same pnr is not efficient by rules guards couldnt handle the ball because travels were so strictly called that your hand had to be on the top of the ball every freaking time let alone carrying the ball your fingers couldnt touch the ball on the sides so guards were mostly effective through offball movement cutting giveandgos and running in transition after drebs youll see the defense there russell thurmond beaty so many great defensive players
nba,not_removed,im not trying to overreact but iman shumpert has been playing so bad lately it doesnt help that hes been so inconsistent with his jumper but his defense has also taken a huge step back
nba,not_removed,reunited and it feels so good
nba,not_removed,im very happy for their bromance and the knicks
nba,not_removed,trout and its not even close other players have deservingly won the mvp in basketball during lebron career brady vs manning is a daily debate crosby isnt that far away from ovi trout has been the best player in his league every year since breaking into the league and hes not even in his prime the pace mike trout is on has been matched by like players in history
nba,not_removed,with all do respect tiger woods has to be at the top of this list tv ratings and golf in general jumped to an unprecedented level all the other players have had little impact on ratings and popularity they are popular players but when player carries a whole sports interest thats a whole new level not to mention winning your sports biggest titles by like strokes more than once messi and federer as well if you look up federers stats they are mindblowingfederer holds several records of the open era holding the world no position for weeks including consecutive weeks winning grand slam singles titles reaching each grand slam final at least five times an alltime record and reaching the wimbledon final ten times he is among the eight men and among the five in open era to capture a career grand slam federer shares an open era record for most titles at wimbledon with pete sampras seven and at the us open with jimmy connors and sampras five he is the only male player to win five consecutive us open titles federer has reached mens singles grand slam finals including in a row from the wimbledon championships to the us open both statistics being records he also appeared in of finals from the wimbledon through to the australian open he reached the semifinals at consecutive grand slam tournaments from the wimbledon championships through the australian open at the wimbledon championships he reached a record grand slam quarterfinal and a record grand slam semifinal earlier at the australian open he played in a record consecutive grand slam tournament earlier at the us open he reached a record grand slam final also earlier at the french open federer reached a record consecutive grand slam quarterfinal federer has won the most matches in grand slam events and is the first to record wins at each grand slam tournament
nba,not_removed,trouts basically been the best player in baseball from his start in the majors its crazy just how good of a player he is
nba,not_removed,ovechkin would have more career goals than sidney crosby even if he sat out the last seasons including this one its really tough to judge hockey against other sports where one player can win you a championship
nba,not_removed,probably trout hes insane fuck mike trout
nba,not_removed,lets see bradys had some stiff comp for best player in the league for years now manning was his eternal rival then rodgers cropped up then adrian peterson and jj watt became gods i suppose hes still the best of the best and that helps his case but hes had a few players crop up here and there that can really touch him lebron has had kobe steph and kd be on his level over the course of the last eight years and now harden and westbrook are evolving and getting on his level im not too wellversed in hockey but isnt ovechkin also incredibly good now trout going by bwar hes had two ten war seasons and a couple other nine war years and hes still only about to reach his prime ideally shouldve been a fourtime mvp by now but got robbed against cabrera and lost a close race against donaldson that was only close because of team records individually no other player really shines like he does maybe bryce harper that one year i think its close between trout and brady gotta wait and see if trout continues his absurd run of dominance into his thirties because bradys on the wrong side of but hes still one of the three best qbs in the league
nba,not_removed,i think its harder to do in baseball
nba,not_removed,random question is crosby still considered the best player in the nhl i havent followed hockey for a while
nba,not_removed,trout is literally mickey mantle so him
nba,not_removed,brady is the most decorated of those but i wouldnt say he is far above his peers when people can argue peyton over him
nba,not_removed,i really cant say because i only follow the nba but i think lebron is easily the most recognizable from all those guys have all those guys been clear best or top in the league since their first season
nba,not_removed,brady
nba,not_removed,brady because hes going to be considered the goat in his sport lebron a close second maybe first depending on how he finishes
nba,not_removed,due to the nature of the game the answer is clearly lebron james
nba,not_removed,lebron james is probably the best athlete of the
nba,not_removed,lebron for sure finals in a row and counting is a magnificent accomplishment
nba,not_removed,i dont understand do you mean currently playing
nba,not_removed,lebron because this is rnba
nba,not_removed,hmm im going to have to brad and james just because of the number of championships and championship appearances but crosby is in a league with what i believe to be is more parity
nba,not_removed,ricky rubio
nba,not_removed,probably either brady or lebron
nba,not_removed,it is between lebron and trout id probably go with lebron just because he has been the best player in the league and by far since nobody has ever even come close to rivaling him during that time period brady is the least he is arguably not even the best qb of this generation with peyton and rodgers i would say brady is the kobe of the nba while peyton was the lebron although peytonbrady is much closer while kobe and lebron isnt it is just funny because we know lebron has less rings than kobe because of lesser teammates but in the nfl world we dont let peyton slide with that it is strange
nba,not_removed,trout or lebron mcdavid is really close to crosby right now and i dont follow football as much so not sure about brady
nba,not_removed,it will probably be auston matthews in a few years
nba,not_removed,ronda rousey
nba,not_removed,tough to say id say a tie between brady and bron but crosby is not far behind trout imo is far behind the other he is not a transcendent generational player like lebronbrady or even crosby
nba,not_removed,yeah i read an article recently that talked about how the mickey mantle comps were actually understating how good trout is since trout has clearly been better than mantle through age
nba,not_removed,as a casual fan of all sports other than nba its weird that i hear about trout the least
nba,not_removed,brady vs manning is was a daily debate i agree that its trout though
nba,not_removed,i dont follow hockey at all as i am from australia but i know a few of the players how good or how will conor mcdavid be
nba,not_removed,i like that you mentioned tiger great shoutout id throw serena williams in there nobody pays attention to womens tennis but she is by far the most dominant athlete of the
nba,not_removed,gonna be a great for about tiger one day
nba,not_removed,only knock against fed is that in his prime nadal still got the best of him regularly
nba,not_removed,neither woods nor fed are from the most recent generations of their sport in golf in the postwoods era theres very little separation between the top players and in tennis though the gap is narrower djokovic has definitively been the most dominant player of this decade
nba,not_removed,many people forget how dominant tiger was that cheating scandal messed him up big time
nba,not_removed,ovechkin isnt even in the same stratosphere as sid at this point crosby has always been better more to hockey than goals even though crosby scored a tonne crosby had injury trouble at his peak and hadnt returned to form until this season really even though hes still been the best player the entire time
nba,not_removed,westbrook on his level lmao
nba,not_removed,which is why its so special that trout is doing it
nba,not_removed,yes
nba,not_removed,yup won his second stanley cup with the penguins last season currently leading the league in goals and points
nba,not_removed,trout definitely has been
nba,not_removed,lebron was not top in his second season
nba,not_removed,brady isnt even necessarily the best from his own era though manning was often better and didnt have the goat coach there is a reason peyton won mvps to bradys
nba,not_removed,serena williams
nba,not_removed,thats not really a great way to rank them because in baseball stars have much less influence over a game trout is basically baseballs lebron but because his team is worse he hasnt reached the championship game much less won it
nba,not_removed,doesnt peyton have the better statistics whilst brady has the hardware
nba,not_removed,crosby is still a level above mcdavid
nba,not_removed,mcdavid is really close to crosby right now what that is a massive oversell of mcdavid lol
nba,not_removed,trout is a transcendent player and he will reach the other fairly easily at age through full seasons he has allstar appearances mvps he should have and has accumulated a ridiculous war hes on pace to put up some of the greatest offensive numbers in mlb history the only thing holding him back is being on a shitty team
nba,not_removed,to say that is to be completely unaware of baseball theres like players in history that have matched trout so far in his career
nba,not_removed,yup thanks to uparst its a bunch of hall of famers and future hall of famers and trout has been better than all of them up to that point now not like fwar is perfect and defense and baserunning metrics are hard to get right but hes a monster
nba,not_removed,ive read that and though i dont know how true it is since baserunning and defensive stats from that era are garbage at best the fact that trout is compared to mickey fucking mantle says all you need to know about how good he is
nba,not_removed,its a shame that hes stuck on the angels
nba,not_removed,i think its mostly cause the angels suck also hes a just a calm and humble guy someone like bryce harper gets a lot more media attention because hes outspoken and demonstrative on the field also it doesnt hurt that he plays on a much better team
nba,not_removed,youll hear about trout from baseballcentered personalities and shows but hes not in national cycles as much because the focus really turns to baseball in the postseason as it does in every sport and trout hasnt really been there obviously baseball still gets coverage but a lot of that coverage comes during october
nba,not_removed,man cant carry his team to success in baseball like in other sports so trout hasnt gotten as much publicity as his greatness probably deserves that said he improves his team a ton just not enough to get the same attention as a lebron
nba,not_removed,serenas probably the best womens athlete in the world behind ronda rousey aye lmao
nba,not_removed,probably because womens tennis has has the worst ped policy out there short of the nba fair or not she has gone from a very decent looking athlete to looking like a linebacker whose head has grown massively
nba,not_removed,thats because nadal was unconsciously elite on clay
nba,not_removed,really only on clay where nadal is literally the goat
nba,not_removed,no he didnt that was at the tail end and at the australian he made of finals from to
nba,not_removed,fed dominated until so id say that counts as this decade djokovic has definitely been the dominant one since
nba,not_removed,his affair he never cheated the game
nba,not_removed,his injury trouble supposed to be some kind of positive hes also never been always better what kind of revisionist history bullshit is that
nba,not_removed,youre missing the key operator getting hes not there yet but if he can sustain his play this year hes gonna get there by force you can keep hating on westbrook all you want you cant deny that his peak is looking better than most will ever see in a lifetime but of course you and your stuck in the bullshit wont ever admit that
nba,not_removed,absolutely hes probably been the best player every season except when harper was playing like a mad man
nba,not_removed,who would you say were
nba,not_removed,hes pretty commonly put ahead of manning because of mannings playoff let downs
nba,not_removed,trout hasnt been in the league as long and so unfortunately that hurts him in this category
nba,not_removed,that is correct peyton is essentially the lebron of the nba while brady is kobe although from a legacy standpoint i would probably say brady is more like duncan especially when patriots spurs and pop belichick without a doubt
nba,not_removed,there are a lot of other factors to consider environment and team construction are probably the two most common ones their statistics are generally quite comparable allaround although bradys major advantage is his notably lower turnover rate
nba,not_removed,maybe but mcdavid is only and he leads the nhl in points i believe i dont think hes on crosbys level but it isnt a massive oversell to say hes close anyway my point is its not crosby lebron or trout to answer ops question
nba,not_removed,whats the third you think when cabrera beat him
nba,not_removed,i dont really care for baseball so while i know who trout is and that he is great i was not prepared for that graph it is insane
nba,not_removed,i agree that defensive stats from the past are garbage but for baserunning stats all you need is playbyplay data so you can know how often someone has a successful steal goes to to home etc and we do have playbyplay data from that era
nba,not_removed,i have no idea who bryce harper is
nba,not_removed,that fight was just sad tbh
nba,not_removed,if you count up the other surfaces its a lot closer but nadal still edges him out in head to heads
nba,not_removed,yes he did nadal beat federer at the french open every year from and federer only won the french when soderling knocked out nadal in
nba,not_removed,right sorry i guess it couldve been worded out a bit better
nba,not_removed,yes yes he has
nba,not_removed,westbrooks game wont age well fam
nba,not_removed,shoutout to mookie this year tho
nba,not_removed,kg shaqduncankobe kg was pretty easily the best player in the league that year and the other were next in some order
nba,not_removed,nah hes not commonly put ahead its an ongoing argument thats pretty evenly split as for playoffs thats pretty much all on the teamscoaches they have had brady almost always had better defenses a better line and a better run game and of course the greatest coach ever despite that they have almost identical qbrs in the playoffs to and peyton is actually against brady in the playoffs
nba,not_removed,if anything the fact that hes been the best player in the league since his first full season besides where harper had a crazy year gives him a stronger case crosby brady and lebron may have been great right when they started playing but were they immediately the best player in their sport
nba,not_removed,he has a lower turnover rate mostly because he had a better defense in his career and was able to win by sitting on the ball and not taking chances peyton never had that except in his final year brady was put in a better position to win thanks to his defense coaching special teams ol run game peyton had better wrs which is how one could argue he has better stats and he definitely does if you look at all the efficiency stats such as yards per attempt tds etc
nba,not_removed,in that case lebron is not a top three player in the league anymore because westbrook durant and harden all have superficially more impressive statlines actually a better comparison would be to say giannis is on the same level as lebron because mcdavid is also not better than tarasenko or ovechkin or seguin or as much as i dislike him kane despite his nice point totals the numbers are nice yes and those numbers certainly indicate a phenomenal future but a clear difference in tiers does exist
nba,not_removed,mcdavid and crosby are tied in points but crosby has played less games
nba,not_removed,yeah i know miggy got the triple crown that year but trout had a war of which is just mindboggling i dont think its ridiculous that miggy got it as the triple crown is an amazing accomplishment and he deserved recognition for it and also because war isnt everything but i do think trout was more deserving of the mvp
nba,not_removed,really arguable the best young baseball player other than trout pick made it to the majors at and won the mvp two years ago at you cant watch sportcenter during baseball season without them dedicating a minutes portion to him the media cant get enough of him
nba,not_removed,do you only watch the ws nats are playoff regulars since harper has gotten there
nba,not_removed,thats mainly because nadal was on some god tier shit playing on clay courts everyone lost to nadal on clay
nba,not_removed,only at court that doesnt count as anything other than being special on specific environment federer dominated every single top except the australian which he still did fine
nba,not_removed,good point great argument
nba,not_removed,he was definitely great but trout was still better dudes a beast
nba,not_removed,fair enough i knew it wasnt exactly accurate but paintrd a decent picture
nba,not_removed,thank you and not only that brady might not even be the best qb of the it could very well be aaron rodgers tom brady might not even have been the best qb in any generation in the it was probably peyton manning and the it was probably aaron rodgers tom bradys argument as goat is ring count not abilitytalentimpact
nba,not_removed,completely pointless and hypothetical but i feel like if peyton was with belichick his whole career hed be the clear cut goat
nba,not_removed,well shit yah got me there also id put mcdavid above the guys you mentioned hes a clear top player
nba,not_removed,its not the triple crown year imo it was the other miggy mvp year that should have clearly been trouts mvp the triple crown was huge since it hadnt been done in like years but miggy winning the other one was disgraceful then again i get why too voters thinking hes a rookie already going to win roty rookies cant win mvp etc
nba,not_removed,i feel i understand both ideas on who people think should have won haha im obviously biased towards cabrera but yeah i think both deserved it
nba,not_removed,i only watched game of the ws like a lot of casuals
nba,not_removed,he lost to nadal in a top wimbledon final of all time
nba,not_removed,yep if a person thinks brady is the goat in football then we should probably expect them to also have bill russell as the goat in basketball i dont see a lot of people making that argument and frankly i think bill russell is higher on the bball list than brady is on the football of course i also think at this point it is not even debatable that belichick is the goat pro football coach so that makes me adjust my view of brady a bit i know it is a dumb bit of mental masturbation but i sometimes wonder how many super bowls peyton wouldve won had he been in ne with bill
nba,not_removed,that is how i feel and that is why i think peyton is better i mean we know lebron is better than kobe and we know that kobe only has more rings because of his teammatessupporting cast i feel it is literally the same way about peyton vs brady but for some reason they just dont accept it it is strange that people in football dont accept that teams win championships not players but in basketball they do super strange given that players are in football while only players win for basketball i suppose it may depend on who you talk to the consensus is easily lebron on the internet but tons of casual fans and people walking around would still tell you kobe probably
nba,not_removed,the thing about the triple crown year for me is that trouts war was points higher than miggys like i said war isnt everything but that is just a stupidly large difference
nba,not_removed,toward the tail end of his prime but yes it was amazing
nba,not_removed,i judge greatness based on how successful one would have been with equal counterparts i think if peyton and brady had equal casts peyton would be more successful than him they very evidently did not have better supporting cast peyton had better wrs while brady had better everything else and some not even close like special teams coaching etc
nba,not_removed,i really do not think you watch a lot of football if you feel peyton was at all clearly better i would take the past ten years of brady over peyton from belichick is the nfls most phenomenal coach and the patriot organisation as a whole is superb but brady elevates that offence on a yeartoyear basis in a way peyton might have matched at his peak but certainly never emphatically surpassed and the corollary to that belichick peyton argument is that brady on those denver teams leads to probably even more success does last years denver team lose a single game if they had brady instead of peytons corpse could peyton drag the patriots to the conference title game
nba,not_removed,i would take the past ten years of brady over peyton from lets compare their stats from brady passer rating ypg tds ints completion anya peyton passer rating ypg tds ints completion anya you are just foolish in that case bradys entire argument over peyton has and always will just be rings it is not stats and it certainly is not talent or ability brady elevates that offence on a yeartoyear basis in a way peyton might have matched at his peak but certainly never emphatically surpassed lol what peyton in was better than brady ever was including year when he went the only argument for brady over peyton is literally just he has more rings which is again thanks to belichick and the rest of his team ol running game defense etc no one will dispute with you patriots colts but we are comparing two qbs here what skills did brady do better than peyton we talked about not turning the ball over but again brady could sit on the ball and have his defense bail him out peyton did not he had to gunsling and win games by himself all the time because he never had the same help that brady did and the corollary to that belichick peyton argument is that brady on those denver teams leads to probably even more success does last years denver team lose a single game if they had brady instead of peytons corpse peyton was done last season that is not new you can put in prime peyton manning or peyton manning just a few years ago on last seasons team and theyd go i am talking about the course of their careers meaning peyton in starts with belichick i am sensing rings here could peyton drag the patriots to the conference title game what makes you think he couldnt brady didnt even do anything in the round before he just let legarette blount and his run game do all the work
nba,not_removed,i also never thoughtsaid peyton was clearly better the disparity is not the difference between kobe and lebron but the arguments are similar one guy is more talentedimpactful peytonlbj the other guy has more rings kobebrady anyone who watched those two play in their prime knew peyton was probably better it is why peyton has mvps compared to bradys and it is also why peyton has allpro first teams at qb compared to bradys
nba,not_removed,i will respond to most of the idiocy here later but right off the bat you excluded three of bradys best years i said bradys past ten not his ten during the same period bookended by mannings two best years and no peyton was not better in than brady in in brady went undefeated against an enormously difficult schedule while putting up points per possession the patriots under him have featured like five of the fifteen best offences in nfl history with generally worse receivers than peyton had for most of his career and without the advantage of playing in a dome for over half his games or even of constantly avoiding cold weather and as for the patriots do not win twelve games with manning throwing screen passes all day and without a firstround bye i could see a easy upset in the wildcard round or against any opponent with an even mildly functioning run defence
nba,not_removed,rings are not the only argument for brady by any means take away bradys first three rings and i would still consider him better brady elevates himself in the postseason in a way peyton more oneanddones than anyone in history manning failed to do six times he has given his team the lead in the super bowl at the twominute warning he is easily the greatest december quarterback in nfl history and the greatest cold weather quarterback in nfl history he has taken mediocre receivers and turned them into leagueleaders more consistently than anyone his performance against numberone defences is historically excellent he plays in an outdoor stadium in foxborough yet his career numbers barely trail a guy who usually had better receivers and spent most of his time in a dome and unlike brady often struggled when forced to deal with more adversarial weather this is not a case of kobe versus lebron this is jordan versus lebron if anything manning is more comparable to kobe for the disingenuous league awards he was the third best quarterback in was clearly less valuable than priest holmes in and won in one of the weakest mvp races in modern history because the oddson favourite brady missed the entire season peyton put up nice numbers but no one would ever pick him over brady where it counts
nba,not_removed,i excluded three of bradys best years i literally just took their numbers that you talked about and put it on there but since you just fixed what you said here we go even though that season isnt even over yet brady passer rating ypg tds ints completion anya passing attempts games peyton passer rating ypg tds ints completion anya passing attempts games is it closer yeah is it better the answer is still no weapons wouldnt even a legitimate excuse anymore since brady had moss welker and gronk during those years no peyton was not better in than brady in in brady went undefeated against an enormously difficult schedule while putting up points per possession there is literally no statistics that backup brady being better peyton is the most efficient qb season and the greatest season by a qb in nfl history peyton passer rating tds ints ypg anya highest in nfl history passing attempts brady passer rating tds ints ypg anya passing attempts keep in mind that brady in was also running up the score on teams in the quarter since he and moss were both chasing the record that year while peyton sat out the final game and sat out some quarters and by the way peyton played series in the final game of the season which is why it says he played games he would have averaged ypg had he sat the entire game advantage of playing in a dome for over half his games or even of constantly avoiding cold weather he threw for tds in and also broke the record for most yards thrown in a season that year denver doesnt play in a dome last i check and as for the patriots do not win twelve games with manning throwing screen passes all day and without a firstround bye i could see a easy upset in the wildcard round or against any opponent with an even mildly functioning run defence yes clearly he threw tds in a season with all screens lmao your bias against peyton is hilarious the funny thing is that in the playoff win against the colts brady seriously didnt do anything it was all legarette blount and that running game tom brady threw for under yards and his rbs had tds or is peyton not capable of handing the ball off
nba,not_removed,brady elevates himself in the postseason in a way peyton more oneanddones than anyone in history manning failed to do yet bradys passer rating is better than peyton mannings vs both of them decline from their regular season play one and done once again citing a team stat this is just another example of brady having a better team than peyton does he has taken mediocre receivers and turned them into leagueleaders more consistently than anyone can you even name one moss is a hofer welker is probably a hofer gronk is the goat te none of them were league leaders lmao he plays in an outdoor stadium in foxborough yet his career numbers barely trail a guy who usually had better receivers and spent most of his time in a dome and unlike brady often struggled when forced to deal with more adversarial weather peyton threw for tds outdoors i am pretty sure that is not a problem for him if anything manning is more comparable to kobe for the disingenuous league awards peyton has mvps which is more than anyone in nfl history kobe has mvp and arguably doesnt even deserve it the fact that you think peyton is comparable to kobe is laughable kobes only argument over players is rings which peyton lacks peyton is an individual talent and an impactful player which is more aligned with lebron he was the third best quarterback in was clearly less valuable than priest holmes in and won in one of the weakest mvp races in modern history because the oddson favourite brady missed the entire season lol this is just hilarious in peyton outperformed brady despite the fact that brady had better weapons better ol better run game as for he was comvps with steve mcnair therefore holmes wasnt even a top candidate that year peyton put up nice numbers but no one would ever pick him over brady where it counts lol your disliking for peyton is just hilarious stick to other sports cause football isnt a good one for you
nba,not_removed,yet bradys passer rating is better than peyton mannings vs both of them decline from their regular season play yet brady has played much tougher defences to achieve that passer rating as a consequence of making it farther on a yeartoyear basis can you even name one moss is a hofer welker is probably a hofer gronk is the goat te none of them were league leaders lmao he made edelman look like welker for a season or two he made kenbrell thompkins and brandon la fell look superb he is currently making chris hogan look like mike wallace gronk spends half his time injured and he had moss for all of what two seasons of play peyton had marvin harrison and reggie wayne and then he went to demaryius thomas older but still good wes welker julius thomas eric deckeremmanuel sanders peyton threw for tds outdoors i am pretty sure that is not a problem for him with receivers who were historically good after the catch outdoors is not inherently a problem although manning handles cold weather far less well than brady but domes are definitely an advantage and it is an advantage which brady exploits back in bradys career passer rating was seven points higher than mannings when both played in a dome and i would not be surprised if it had increased since then peyton has mvps which is more than anyone in nfl history the point was at least a couple of those were just given because of the name in the same sense kobe received alldefence nods well after he stopped deserving them in peyton outperformed brady despite the fact that brady had better weapons better ol better run game you ass he was coming off of an injury which kept him out for the entire season brady was superb the three years after that had a down year in with a group of scrubby receivers and has been fantastic in the three years since that of course all of that is irrelevant to the point of whether or not peyton deserved an mvp in when favre and brees both had better statistics even on a per game basis with only a marginally worse team record stick to other sports cause football isnt a good one for you and yet most people who know anything about football agree brady is the best hmm
nba,not_removed,yet brady has played much tougher defences to achieve that passer rating as a consequence of making it farther on a yeartoyear basis thats not true at all playing teams in a later conference does not correlate with it being a tougher defense i am actually pretty sure peyton played against better defenses than brady did he made edelman look like welker for a season or two he made kenbrell thompkins and brandon la fell look superb he is currently making chris hogan look like mike wallace gronk spends half his time injured and he had moss for all of what two seasons of play peyton had marvin harrison and reggie wayne and then he went to demaryius thomas older but still good wes welker julius thomas eric deckeremmanuel sanders edelman is a good wr in his own right kembrell thompkins had yards and dobson had yards you call that a league leader lafell was a starting wr before ne and still is a starting wr in the nfl with the bengals chris hogan was also a starting wr for the bills and he currently has less than yards this season speaking of which marvin harrison demaryius thomas eric decker emmanuel sanders never had a yard season before peyton got there julius thomas has done nothing before and after peyton so who is the one making wrs good again brady making bums look like league leading wrs lol with receivers who were historically good after the catch outdoors is not inherently a problem although manning handles cold weather far less well than brady but domes are definitely an advantage and it is an advantage which brady exploits back in bradys career passer rating was seven points higher than mannings when both played in a dome and i would not be surprised if it had increased since then because bradys sample size was hella lower peyton has played more games in a dome playing more dome games would just reduce the mean for brady stats buddy the point was at least a couple of those were just given because of the name in the same sense kobe received alldefence nods well after he stopped deserving them not really alldefense is not even close to being comparable to mvps for one even if you want to say peyton wasnt the mvp peyton has allpro teams in comparison to tom bradys what does that mean peyton was the best qb for years while brady was only the best qb twice in his career you ass he was coming off of an injury which kept him out for the entire season brady was superb the three years after that had a down year in with a group of scrubby receivers and has been fantastic in the three years since that cool peyton came back from neck surgeries in and he was in mvp allpro first team qb and also outperformed brady yet brady couldnt outperform peyton in when he had better wrs ol rb lol and yet most people who know anything about football agree brady is the best hmm they dont anyone who argues brady relies on ring count so there is that your currently pulling arguments out of your ass right now which is why you dodged the other response i gave you about peyton being better than brady and how you made an idiotic comment about how peyton threw tds all screen passes
nba,not_removed,i am not dodging responses i am replying in limited facilities on mobile before i leave for vacation so i cannot easily search previously collected data in the same way you can plenty of statistical analysis has been done supporting bradys adjusted superiority and i value that much more than blind counting statistics and media awards
nba,not_removed,plenty of statistical analysis has been done supporting bradys adjusted superiority and i value that much more than blind counting statistics and media awards like what youve provided nothing other than making up bullshit narratives like brady made his bum wrs into superstars which he didnt peyton throwing tds worth of screens peyton being a playoff choker while brady elevating his postseason play which is also false considering how there is a difference in passer rating and peyton had a better passer rating before the superbowl against an elite panthers defense you are throwing a bunch of false narratives at me that have substance there is nothing wrong with saying brady is better because it is close nonetheless your arguments are just full of shit
nba,not_removed,how are you so bad at reading first you misread a comparison of bradys past ten years to mannings best ten despite the fact you quoted it and then try to pretend i somehow changed what is aid when again you quoted me as marking a the comparisons as bradys past ten versus mannings now you cannot read that i never said i provided certain statistical analyses i simply said those advanced analyses existed but i was not in a position to actually provide legitimate research because of technological limitations at the end of the day brady has led his team to six super bowls and left the field with a lead during the final two minutes in all of them while manning received one ring while letting his defence do all the work and while leading the league in interceptions per game and received another ring because of a failed fourthandtwo conversion on the back of a dpoys return from injury if i want to win a meaningless game by a large margin against a bad team sure i might go with manning but against a top defence or against a tough playoff opponent give me brady anytime
nba,not_removed,now you cannot read that i never said i provided certain statistical analyses i simply said those advanced analyses existed but i was not in a position to actually provide legitimate research because of technological limitations and because you dont have any keep acting like i buy your stupid excuse of i dont have the technology around me to figure it out when in reality it is that you dont have any stats at all your literally pulling arguments out of your ass and bullshit ass narrative that patriots fans make up to prop up brady when they have merit to them at the end of the day brady has led his team to six super bowls and left the field with a lead during the final two minutes in all of them and he can thank his team for having a great defense holding them in that position while peyton didnt especially in the seahawks superbowl as they allowed a tdfgspecial teams td every single damn time they touched the ball read your own damn post your entire argument is all about tom brady having a better team nothing about tom brady himself being better tom brady won more superbowls tom brady led his team to more superbowls these are all team accomplishments here but you know without team accomplishments brady doesnt have an argument manning received one ring while letting his defence do all the work and while leading the league in interceptions per game and received another ring because of a failed fourthandtwo conversion on the back of a dpoys return from injury the funny thing is that peyton has incredibly similar postseason stats as brady yet here you are saying peyton got carried while brady didnt brady playoff stats passer rating yards td int rushing td sacks manning playoff stats passer rating yards tds int sacks and didnt brady have his teammate get a pick thanks to the worst playcall in nfl history in when there was like a chance they would have lost had they ran the ball to marshawn lynch and you want to sit here and say only peyton gets bailed out by defense and carried while brady doesnt fuck outta here if i want to win a meaningless game by a large margin against a bad team sure i might go with manning but against a top defence or against a tough playoff opponent give me brady anytime if i had equal supporting cast i am pretty sure peyton would have more success than brady imagine if peyton manning played on the patriots franchise with belichick with that defense etc that is rings right there your entire argument is just laughable rings ringz ringz this is just like the kobe vs lebron debate with peyton being lebron and brady being kobe
nba,not_removed,yes i am sure it is easy to imagine i am outright lying and am simply incapable of using any reference site because they you can keep telling yourself something which every other nfl expert was wrong two years ago at the very least most of them are smart enough to realise brady leading a final clutch drive near the end of every super bowl has no bearing on his teams defence and most of them are also probably smart enough to realise manning is no more successful with the patriots over the past ten years than brady and in fact would have cost them that title meanwhile manning fell out of the year as one of the worst quarterbacks in the league whereas brady is still a top three quarterback and showing no sign of throwing those ducks with plagued manning during his renaissance i wonder how many more titles denver would have won if they had swapped quarterbacks does brady throw a picksix against the saints in i doubt it
nba,not_removed,at the very least most of them are smart enough to realise brady leading a final clutch drive near the end of every super bowl has no bearing on his teams defence tell mehow can you have a final clutch drive if your defense cant even hold the opposing teams offense to even make the game close or tie it up oh thats rightyou cant just like if you cant hold a team to get a points in basketball you have no chance of getting a game winningtying shot most of them are also probably smart enough to realise manning is no more successful with the patriots over the past ten years than brady and in fact would have cost them that title who said this lol you are just speculating bullshit i mean you have regurgitated nothing but bullshit this entire time brady made bum wrs look good false all of his wrs were either good in their own right or were just as much of bums with brady peytons numbers are only good cause he played in a dome false tds outdoors peyton threw tds worth of screen plays lmao nfl defenses are pathetic then bradys season is better than peytons season false every statistic says otherwise brady would be better if he had better weapons false season where brady had better weapons while peyton won the mvp right in front of his face and outperformed him says otherwise at the end of the day you just dont really have a clue and are just saying idiotic nonsense meanwhile manning fell out of the year as one of the worst quarterbacks in the league whereas brady is still a top three quarterback and showing no sign of throwing those ducks with plagued manning during his renaissance peyton played seasons before brady did so he has greater mileage talk to me if brady plays elite for seasons because his decline is inevitable i wonder how many more titles denver would have won if they had swapped quarterbacks does brady throw a picksix against the saints in i doubt it he was our qb from considering how peyton had a coach in john fox in of those seasons and he didnt prepare for the noise in the superbowl ill go with and that is the same one peyton won coaching has held peyton back which is why we are saying give peyton manning bill belichick and he would see greater success
nba,not_removed,drtg is a pretty shit stat though hes among centers in drpm by your same criteria so no he isnt one of the worst centers in the league defensively
nba,not_removed,ive include pfcs seems meaningless kat is worse kp and tchan who are known to be good defenders have the same drtg as jokic i dont think jokic is an elite defender but i find it hard to say that hes below average
nba,not_removed,drtg is a shit stat for measuring individual players dbpm or dws would be a better gauge
nba,not_removed,he definitely has some defensive sturggles but hes a very important cog for denver on the offensive end as of late i was reading a zach lowe piece where he mentioned that the lineup of mudiay will barton wilson chandler danilo gal and jokic was doing crazy well points per minute wise
nba,not_removed,ortg and drtg are team stats and terrible to measuring players rockets players now have better ortg than anthony davis carmelo anthony john wall paul george and demarcus cousins doesnt mean anything
nba,not_removed,today is shit on the nuggets night apparently please tell me where rocky hurt you all
nba,not_removed,hes incredible offensively though i can understand wings and guards hell even some undersized being swiss army knives on offense but not i think he more than makes up for whatever defensive lapses he has with his overall offensive game unlike other offensefirst centers i know
nba,not_removed,dont you dare throw stats into this hes amazing also rookie big men take time to develop he has to learn how to stay square but that will come with time
nba,not_removed,oh nokic
nba,not_removed,ever since the kawhi thing happened ive gotta see the opinions of people who watch a player before judging him purely from what stats seem to suggest
nba,not_removed,using drating as your only metric to evaluate a single player is a poor idea especially if you strip it of context in this case that the nuggets are a poor defensive team hes actually well decent above average is probably stretching it a bit
nba,not_removed,stop with this nonsense this stat does not matter some advanced statistics say jokic is the best player in the nba and those are the stats that should be taken seriously
nba,not_removed,paging
nba,not_removed,but yet kat is worse
nba,not_removed,i hate jokic but hes a young center it takes time to learn how to defend especially when youre not an exceptional athlete idk whether hell ever be a great or even good defender but hell definitely improve
nba,not_removed,exactly mark cuban has said in the past that teams have their own stat guys and do their own stat keeping and some of the things they measure arent made public if hes still getting playing time the team knows something we dont edit the most impactful stats other than the score are typically tagged and tracked by individual teams and never published mark cuban
nba,not_removed,also hes factoring out every nonstarter which is a lot of dudes and it was pretty unclear for most of the season who was going to be the starting center for that team whats with all the jokic hating posts this morning
nba,not_removed,exactly
nba,not_removed,as much as i would like to disagree with you hes extremely average hes slow can get bullied by bigger centers and commits incredibly frustrating and needless fouls on defense to call him above average would be very nice even i think he has the iq to become better
nba,not_removed,jahlil okafor at you say so
nba,not_removed,tyson chandler is not a good defender anymore half of his defense is just his reputation at this point
nba,not_removed,is kp actually a good defender it seems like he defends the rim well when there but he isnt there that often he also doesnt do much else on that end
nba,not_removed,fwiw this is the bball ref drtg which is a formula based on box score metrics and team defense this isnt the drtg with jokic on the court that nbacom uses
nba,not_removed,dbpm measures defence by the box score its pretty dam shit in its own right
nba,not_removed,they mean something you just have to be able to look at data and watch games to figure that out if you are just taking everything at face value then you arent using the data correctly
nba,not_removed,i dont think anybody has a problem with using stats just understand what a stat measures and its validity drtg is heavily based on teams and stat sheet stats so if a teams drtg is bad and a player does not get a lot of blocks or steals that his drtg will appear terrible compared to players on other teams
nba,not_removed,dont you dare throw stats into this jokics biggest fanboy throws stats into it constantly
nba,not_removed,stop
nba,not_removed,they have the same drtg
nba,not_removed,woo someone hates one of our players weve made it to the big time fellow nuggets fans
nba,not_removed,well hes only getting like a game so yeah maybe they do know something we dont given his ability on offense the only thing holding him back from playing minutes is probably defense
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,still i dont consider him a bad defender though do you if hes not an elite defender anymore why is he getting minutes over the younger suns bigs shouldnt you guys be trying to develop them
nba,not_removed,use onoff vs ratings much better barometer
nba,not_removed,if you aint afraid to be banned go for it
nba,not_removed,yea hes annoying as fuck bringing him up at all times makes it a lot worse
nba,not_removed,not paging paging
nba,not_removed,thats step
nba,not_removed,i like all of your players
nba,not_removed,no he only gets minutes because he has foul problems and malone refuses to play him if he has foul trouble for whatever reason
nba,not_removed,to be fair i wouldnt need any advanced stats to claim that nurkic is our best defensive big man
nba,not_removed,i just wanted to see nurk play again defensive rating sometimes tells you information however its not a absolute by any means
nba,not_removed,ok fine i admit jokić is a bad defender but only if you admit jokić kat defensively
nba,not_removed,hes in maybe at most of threads and that are jokic or nuggets threads is he really that annoying or are you just in every thread he is commenting or hes mentioned in at this point people like you are just looking for ways to be annoyed by him
nba,not_removed,true hes pretty obviously a good defender even going by just the eye test but what that other dude does all the time is use specific stats when they favor him but then call them shit stats and meaningless when they dont
nba,not_removed,oooh what if i say no
nba,not_removed,tbh lol fam
nba,not_removed,i get your point but in this spesific case i think its valid because a nurkic is by far our best big man advanced stats aside so using drtg to make a point we all can agree with isnt horrible b jokic isnt the third worst defensive center in the nba averaging more than and we all know that i can name many others i get your point though and the nuggets fanbase has already called him out on his loose use of advanced stats
nba,not_removed,hes going to tell on you
nba,not_removed,derozan is lol also fuck that site
nba,not_removed,lmao at thompson ranking second to last and being labeled not an overly great defender just what i would expect from a clickbait slideshow article
nba,not_removed,terrible list
nba,not_removed,this list is horriblebutler and klay
nba,not_removed,that shit was crazy
nba,not_removed,fuck up some commas
nba,not_removed,highlight of the season so far what the actual fuck
nba,not_removed,lebron does some fuckin weird but cool shit sometimes
nba,not_removed,httpiimgurcomcxxfunsjpg
nba,not_removed,lebron is like a high school guidance counselor in the weird but effective shit he does edit even one for mo and dahntay jones lol
nba,not_removed,he later showed them a needle which he inserted into shumperts doll ow said shumpert lebron nodded
nba,not_removed,well thats definitely unique
nba,not_removed,just so everyone knows he hosts a halloween party every year and made them for the party didnt just randomly make chucky dolls haha
nba,not_removed,thats awesome
nba,not_removed,the uncle drew doll even has kyrie on edit tts has a kardashians tshirt on too lol
nba,not_removed,that is fucking weird i like it
nba,not_removed,he made them
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,made
nba,not_removed,he hosts a halloween party every year for that
nba,not_removed,the story wouldve been better if we found out that lebron just customizes dolls in his spare time
nba,not_removed,fuck you that title scared the shit outta me
nba,not_removed,title is dumb
nba,not_removed,wow im glad this isnt what i expected it to be
nba,not_removed,a possibly misleading title comments within minutes shitting on the title deletes post
nba,not_removed,btw between curry and harden who do you think ends up with more total points im gonna say harden because he is far more durable
nba,not_removed,yeah because points is the end all be all stat to determine player value or importance are you done shitposting yet get it all out of your system
nba,not_removed,i think you mean tied for best subtle tanking efforts were killin em out there keep it up heatbros
nba,not_removed,clutch loss boys
nba,not_removed,the key is to get blown out in the or early avoid that type of situation all together
nba,not_removed,tank game skrong
nba,not_removed,were tied for seed in choking—yes
nba,not_removed,a popular pundit on twitter told me that close or clutch game records were irrelevant since the situations were pretty much games seems wrong to me am i just oldfashioned and buying into those intangible ideas like clutchness is losing a lot of close games indicative of not being able to close it out or is it really just bad luck
nba,not_removed,nice
nba,not_removed,feelsbadman
nba,not_removed,miami also have leagues worst ft
nba,not_removed,byron scott nodded
nba,not_removed,we on that dion island tank
nba,not_removed,we have so much to learn from you
nba,not_removed,ah i see your team has turd quarters too
nba,not_removed,they inherited the turd quarter from the bulls
nba,not_removed,align that with rotations typically usedseen and youll be onto something
nba,not_removed,qualitatively whats going on
nba,not_removed,but this isnt a terrible problem to have atleast they are coming out with fire its much harder to take a lead than losing a lead wolves should be able to fix this problem
nba,not_removed,im surprised at the drating id expect the wolves to be a lot better on the defensive end
nba,not_removed,kings held them to points in the q that was so beautiful to watch
nba,not_removed,close game losses
nba,not_removed,those half time adjustments really seem to be doing the trick
nba,not_removed,perhaps some conditioning issues getting used to actually playing hard at both ends the entire game they will get better
nba,not_removed,teams with shitty quarters unite
nba,not_removed,was this a problem with you guys also
nba,not_removed,they are not making or following through on half time adjustments they are a young team but falls on coach imo
nba,not_removed,if i knew i would be an nba head coach haha but seriously this has to be mental combined with inexperience also memphis and sacramento are both veteran squads they both seemed to turn up the physicality on defense in the half in order to get us out of our game and it obviously worked its just so frustrating to see them play so well in the first half then shit the bed in epic proportions during the quarter its concerning that the exaxt same scenerio happend in two consecutive games
nba,not_removed,there have been periods of good defensive followed by awful stretches i think this is a case where well improve as the season goes on thibs is too good of a defensive coach to have a terrible defensive team he is just working with a bunch of young players where it will take a little bit longer to get the defensive system down pat i still have faith it has only been two games on the road as well and weve lost by a combined total of points
nba,not_removed,yep especially during the season but that was because it was the quarter noah was being rested and the best backup center the bulls had was nazr
nba,not_removed,exactly right thibs not making the right adjustments during the quarter is costing the wolves big time he should have changed the line up around after the kings went on a run he just let it all play out naturally this is what bugged me with sam mitchell he would make the adjustments way too late and from there it would be playing catch up to what the other team was doing the only thing ive notice that this team is doing better is defense
nba,not_removed,im not sure what happened in the memphis game but against kings it felt like the first qtr more of a fluke than the third lavine and wiggins were hitting unassisted shots and pull up threes like they were nothing dieng could not miss from mid range towns made a couple tough buckets on cuz rubio making plays on d for easy transition buckets even friggin dunn hit a three then in the third lavine and wiggins arent in god mode towns gets in foul trouble and bjelica had to stay on the floor and made some terrible plays on both ends which really swung the momentum thibs shouldve pulled him way sooner for bazz and called timeouts more but hes too old school with his timeouts to burn one to stop something intangible like momentum although conserving timeouts almost paid off at end of game just needs to make it clearer that if you play carelessly youre getting benched doesnt matter who you are next man up huge problem for us with karl last year hopefully joerger doesnt lose the room cus of it tho
nba,not_removed,are bench has been awful si that explains it
nba,not_removed,it sounds like the team is missing garnett last year they had him come out with the starters to stabilize things
nba,not_removed,in the memphis game kat was in god mode in the first quarter he had points and the timberwolves as a whole shot from the floor these first two games were eerily similar where we got off to spectacular starts and then played incredibly bad in the quarter weve scored points combined in the two quarters which in both games is the reason why we lost
nba,not_removed,dieng dont miss from mid range
nba,not_removed,i mean kg hardly played in the half of the year but it helps having that vet presence who actually knows what is going on really we have jordan hill and brandon rush but thibs needs to do a better job with the bench he didnt use hill at all when gorgui and kat got into foul trouble he didnt insert bazz or rush in the and opted to roll with the tired wiggins things will get better but so far thibs not making the right adjustments is hurting
nba,not_removed,we are definetly missing some kind of veteran leadership i mean it doesnt even have to be kg watching the game last night and seeing matt barnes make some key plays to help secure a kings victory i was telling my buddy that he is exactly the type of guy we could use off the bench here
nba,not_removed,make nba great again also itt people that dont know how probability models work
nba,not_removed,seriously after game isnt that just slightly ridiculous
nba,not_removed,then the warriors lose to a shitty team and the cycle continues regular season doesnt mean much
nba,not_removed,seems accurate even before the games happened tonight i mean uh sux
nba,not_removed,how could a single regular season gameday affect the odds so much
nba,not_removed,projections are volatile as fuck fair or not i think theyve lost a lot of credibility in the eyes of the general public after the election
nba,not_removed,how did they look at this time last year
nba,not_removed,i am sure their computer algorithm showed that the warriors would win it last year that hillary would be president and that lethal weapon would get cancelled before xmas but guess the fuck what riggs and murtaugh just got a full season ordered by the network boom take that
nba,not_removed,more than slightly the sample size isnt near large enough we arent even a quarter of they way through the season
nba,not_removed,cavs fan here dont blame them at all we are definitely the underdogs here barring another dray meltdown second and third best player in the nba plus two borderline top players i have dray top and good and man sounds like an accurate stat to me
nba,not_removed,nate plastic btfo again
nba,not_removed,before yesterday the warriors were at to win the title i dont remember clearly so yesterday only added to their chances each of the strong teams that lost to far poorer teams had their title chances drop around but the title chances of the nets bucks and magic didnt really rise not surprisingly
nba,not_removed,they were the best model it turns out
nba,not_removed,their elections predictions were while their nba predictions are what on earth does one have to do with another
nba,not_removed,to be fair they had trump at the highest chances compared to most other predictions
nba,not_removed,gave trump a chance to win the election which is pretty substantial in fact they had trump at to win the election while losing the popular vote pretty much every other model had trump at its also important to realize that their model is only as accurate as the public polling data that they can put into it
nba,not_removed,they had jeb bush as a lock to win the east
nba,not_removed,well the warriors pretty much had it in the bag if suspensioninjuries didnt happen
nba,not_removed,that still doesnt mean their model was good tbf
nba,not_removed,nothing people are just stupid though
nba,not_removed,donald trump is president and here you are posting articles kidding
nba,not_removed,i didnt say thay had anything to do with one another they obviously dont but fair or not the election has caused peoples faith in projection websites such as to drop a bit most people dont understand the numbers that go behind these projections they just look at which candidate or which team is supposed to win and judge these sites accordingly
nba,not_removed,please clap
nba,not_removed,lmao
nba,not_removed,kawhi leonard is michael jordan
nba,not_removed,bulls and nets no one saw the shooting coming from bulls in game one but they also banged down low on celtics nets are competing when everyone else gave up on them good coaching and shooting can go a long way
nba,not_removed,i was expecting the kings to play better under joerger but the difference has been insane the defensive intensity is the highest its been since the doug christie days
nba,not_removed,kings
nba,not_removed,i mean i expected dallas to win at least one game by now
nba,not_removed,agree with the bulls also been surprised by the kings even if they have beaten relatively weak teams they still gave the spurs a challenge
nba,not_removed,i thought kenny atkinson would be a good coach but now since the near the end of the preseason i think hes a really damn good coach that nets team is the greatest team in nba history with only nba players
nba,not_removed,its chicago i had them missing the playoffs because their roster looks like something sacramento would scrape together after firing their preseason coach in favor of viveks favorite nephew its early but i was visibly mistaken about the quality of roster they put together they still lack depth but the team is too competitive to be as bad as i had assumed
nba,not_removed,grizzlies
nba,not_removed,nets still crap but fun to watch
nba,not_removed,spurs i thought parker was dead he is i thought pau was dying he is i thought wed miss duncan more and we might still but the chemistry ive seen demonstrated is already awesome and this dedmon guy is solid as fuck in the paint david lee looks like a new man too i still want to see what maximum kawhi and maximum patty can accomplish
nba,not_removed,kings seem to be playing hard its cool to see
nba,not_removed,spurs i thought we had seen kawhi at his best but now he complains to refs gets the star treatment he deserves gets to the line times a game and is still the best defender in the league also the warriors look shaky which makes me confident the spurs will get the seed which will also strengthen kawhis potential mvp case i know people say its early team x will pull it together but im just talking about seeding the spurs have their shit together now which will help them build a lead in the west
nba,not_removed,this thread is well named for everyone surprised by the bulls just note that theyve played two games at home against visitors on the second game of a back to back and down rotation players im still happy about how they performed but vegas favored them in both games so it doesnt change vegass long term predictions about their season we will need some upsets to do that some wins in games where they arent favored also for those surprised by the nets and the bulls what do they have in common they beat the pacers maybe the real surprise is how poorly the pacers have played
nba,not_removed,the miami heat they havent won all their games but i think theyll be able to make playoffs still at this rate dragic and whiteside definitely impressed in that game against the spurs
nba,not_removed,if you had told me before the season that spurswarriors was gonna be a point blowout i would have agreed i just wouldnt believe wed be the winning team
nba,not_removed,rondo and wade are reminding us that basketball smarts count for a lot
nba,not_removed,dwyane wade is finally gonna get the mvp he deserved in
nba,not_removed,overreaction to the other end of the spectrum id say orlando so many fans panicking right now games into the season with a new coaching staff new players and key players missing training camp all i gotta say for our fan base is to relax
nba,not_removed,grizzlies are ready to outshoot the warriors
nba,not_removed,thunder i know theyve played shit teams so far but theyre one of the few undefeated teams left westbrook is playing his ass off
nba,not_removed,i always have high expectation for the spurs and still they manage to surprise me every year kawhi for mvp
nba,not_removed,kings
nba,not_removed,i thought the kings were trainwreck maybe theyre only a bicycle accident
nba,not_removed,actually im quite surprised that a russell westbrookled thunder are currently they dont seem to be struggling without kd and westbrook has unleashed and become a tripledouble machine hes going to average a tripledouble this season and possibly lead his team to at least the conference semifinals
nba,not_removed,other than the horrid first game against the lakers houstons defense in their past games have been surprisingly good though on the same note their offense has not been as good as you would expect despite a modest record for that team i would say this is a positive sign they are sucking at what they are supposed to be good at offense but being good at what they are supposed to suck at defense good defense is sustainable and their bad offense isnt a big cause for concern with dantoni at the helm
nba,not_removed,bulls and knicks
nba,not_removed,forever the most underrated
nba,not_removed,i expected hardens asts to increase but not double digit in asts averaging a game per type of numbers
nba,not_removed,you threepoint worshiping motherbleepers know the answer
nba,not_removed,rockets defence winning the last games and not their offence quite a shocker tbh
nba,not_removed,warriors doing better than i thought after the spurs game
nba,not_removed,bulls nets
nba,not_removed,nuggets bulls also
nba,not_removed,im not gonna lie im totally surprised the warriors have lost before okc wesbrook looks as good as people claimed hed be this season
nba,not_removed,bulls they are the best shooting team this season in games i did not see that coming
nba,not_removed,our point woes arent as bad as people have imagined thus far our rebounding is awesome wade and rondo are building great chemistry and providing much needed leadership shout out to taj gibson for elevating his game to another level thus far averaging asts on field goals over games showing good team orientated offense
nba,not_removed,spurs not trying to be a homer i really didnt think we would see this level of competitiveness from them until after the break their bench play has been amazing also the kings cousins is killing it hopefully he will be with a contender come february
nba,not_removed,nets for sure
nba,not_removed,miami heat my prediction was
nba,not_removed,seattle
nba,not_removed,for sure the dallas mavs seed
nba,not_removed,honestly going into this season i said i think this team can win around games and make the playoffs i knew there would be growing pains but im surprised how good they gel as a unit so early its essentially a new team new system new coaching staff granted were but we had an opportunity to win both games at the end this team fights last years if we were down in the wed give up and the game would be over by the start of the but now if were down with minutes left the young guys are fighting like its game of the nba finals as long as they keep the fight up theyll get better and better thats scary for the rest of the nba
nba,not_removed,this thread is too early wait at least first quarter to end
nba,not_removed,the bucks are still able to compete without middleton
nba,not_removed,russell westbrook is lebron james
nba,not_removed,i like turtles a very appropriate answer to the question at hand
nba,not_removed,kevin durant is a
nba,not_removed,the rebound discrepancy between us and chicago that game was absurd rebounding is our most glaring weakness though
nba,not_removed,joerger is a damn good coach but he hasnt been tested by the players or the organization yet well have to wait and see but it basically seemed to make karl give up
nba,not_removed,the way they were neck and neck with the spurs the other night was impressive they move the ball very well and defense been effective sucks to lose like that in the last minutes but it doesnt burn as much with it being against san antonio cousins looks beast even the addition of barnes has helped too
nba,not_removed,there is a reason theyre a tier team in jk i still dont know the reason
nba,not_removed,rule about dallas your expectations are always wrong
nba,not_removed,this game road trip should tell us a lot about what the kings are made of
nba,not_removed,the nets blogs which are legitimately crazy wanted him fired after game one im not joking we have a split between realistic nets fans who know we are rebuilding and those who just want brook to score a game
nba,not_removed,i think youre underestimating the bulls bench they were pretty much the reason the bulls blew out the pacers
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,hardly crap at all we had a chance to win all games
nba,not_removed,i think patty is better than tp at this point curious if they might consider starting him funny thing about the spurs is i think a lot of people had not great expectations wins but nothing insane but it makes sense that theyre good kawhi is still on the rise td got replaced by pau servicable and lamarcus has another year in the system additionally the emergence of jonathan simmons pattys strong play all these things bode really well for them
nba,not_removed,youre going to love dedmon
nba,not_removed,the best thing about dedmon is the larriors didnt get him
nba,not_removed,i love that the magic decided to give biyombo more per year than dedmon for less production hennigan is a bottom gm but somehow keeps getting a pass
nba,not_removed,pau is good in small doses gives you great spacing passing and block shots you just cant play him heavy minutes teams will exploit the fuck out of the pick n roll cause ive never seen a worse pnr defender than pau last season his offense is cash money though
nba,not_removed,yeah i legit had no expectations at all thought we were gonna mail this season in and wait for next summer pau looked horrid on d in chicago tony was terrible for france and we lost bigs yet here we are dedmon is already better than diawwest boban combined and lee rebounds so much better than west now if danny can pick up his shooting
nba,not_removed,tony is really an eyesore i am seriously considering paying for a david lee jersey also considering a bertans jersey as well those two are a damn good time to watch as a fan
nba,not_removed,as i said earlier my fear is that we end up being the bulls to your heat
nba,not_removed,just popping in to give props to someone that is actually analyzing their own team situation and looking at everything the way it is not that im saying you guys are bad or anything that pt percentage is a huge surprise and you guys seem to gel well taj gibson looks like a completely different player as well
nba,not_removed,i remember getting shit on during the iffseason for thinking the pacers would be worse this year than last
nba,not_removed,nets lost by one possession in a back to back while sitting brook we may suck but theres more to it than lol pacers
nba,not_removed,get out of here with your reasonable thinking lol
nba,not_removed,yup i thought it was going to be an easycasual win for the spurs last night but whiteside winslow dragic and tyler johnson did a great job to keep it close all the game
nba,not_removed,pls
nba,not_removed,and
nba,not_removed,if there is a coach in the east that i believe can turn around and get more out of less its frank i wont say for sure it will happen but hes gonna give it his best
nba,not_removed,suns lakers most teams would be against that schedule
nba,not_removed,the shooting goes to crap in the second halves of games i cant imagine that will last all season
nba,not_removed,not rated at all
nba,not_removed,not sure if name is ironic but genius is spelled wrong just doing my good deed for the day
nba,not_removed,eh they are still getting beat up down low and cant stop anybody their offense is about as good as one can expect but their defense is still incredibly suspect early on
nba,not_removed,we only played the game is fingers crossed though this is a fun group
nba,not_removed,hence the overreaction thread title
nba,not_removed,they lost badly to the pistons who are without reggie jackson they lost handily to charlotte and they just barely squeaked by brooklyn who may be the worst team in the league
nba,not_removed,honestly if westbrook were five inches taller the comparison wouldnt be ridiculous at all
nba,not_removed,kevin
nba,not_removed,fuckboi
nba,not_removed,small forward
nba,not_removed,dolphin noise
nba,not_removed,basketball player
nba,not_removed,fuckbag
nba,not_removed,b
nba,not_removed,thats cause all ur bigs are made of yogurt
nba,not_removed,its been horfords glaring weakness since cleveland became relevant again tbh and even then hes not really been as good at rebounding as his numbers say
nba,not_removed,it basically seemed to make karl give up you do know that karl walked into the front office the first day and said to them he wants to trade cousins right
nba,not_removed,because players like collison and rudy gay are given ratings while they have a rated center plus afflalo is a high
nba,not_removed,if we come out of the road trip with wins it will be a success if we come out with wins then we are going to the wcf
nba,not_removed,i think its really crazy how good he is lopezlinrhjbooker are the only ones that would be in a regular nba rotation and bojan when he gets hot the pace you guys are playing it is real team and system ball you guys are playing in a form where your guys are learning a skill which is what truly matters when youre not good and rebuilding what atkinson is getting out of this time is astonishing i know its early but jfc justin hamilton and joe harris are balling
nba,not_removed,their bench looked great in that game
nba,not_removed,our bench injuries definitely didnt help either stuckey although he doesnt post eye popping stats is an essential part of our second unit he creates the flow and rhythm in addition we have yet to have robinson iii break out of his shell nor have we even seen aaron brooks touch the floor we were also on the second night of a road after getting demoralized by brooklyn not that any of that is an excuse to get beaten as bad as we did i really hope this is a chemistry issue and not knowing each other i really need jeff teague to not suck so much
nba,not_removed,dont take away too much from the bullspacers game as a pacer fan that was the sloppiest game weve played since paul george was a good player
nba,not_removed,me about it since when did marc gasol become a knockdown threepoint shooter we shoulda won last night
nba,not_removed,if youre happy with close losses chances are your team is crap
nba,not_removed,a chance to win three games where do i sign
nba,not_removed,theyre not last years sixers bad but theyre still not doing too great
nba,not_removed,youre the nets you could win the east and still be crap
nba,not_removed,could easily be we played the bucks on the end of a back to back without lopez and got fucked hard by the refs and only lost on a tip in buzzer beater
nba,not_removed,if parker is too proud to come off the bench all the while manu never complained he doesnt belong on the spurs anymore check your ego at the door
nba,not_removed,oh we already love dedmon
nba,not_removed,the best thing about other teams is that their players dont play for golden state
nba,not_removed,david west is a terrible rebounder ive learned in just games that i am going to hate the david west experience
nba,not_removed,no
nba,not_removed,didnt that kinda happen last year
nba,not_removed,to be fair they do have a pretty solid team on paper i still have faith in them i think coaching choices may be the bigger mistake here i cant see them playing this bad if vogel was still at the helm
nba,not_removed,well lets see what happens tonight lopez vs lopez right
nba,not_removed,not the rockets
nba,not_removed,agreed like i said theyve played shit teams but theyre a helluva lot better than they couldve been
nba,not_removed,its meant to play on the stereotype that we poles are such briliant geniouses
nba,not_removed,their offense is way worse than what it could be theyre consistently showing flashes but the chemistry just isnt there yet their defense is also a lot better than everyone is giving them credit for the spurs are a top teams and shot lights out against them and anthony davis had a monster game i dont think their defense was really that bad in any of the games theyve played though they definitely need to work on defensive communication
nba,not_removed,my bad but yea still a fun team
nba,not_removed,and brooklyn was without brook lopez and to be fair they havent looked worstteamintheleague bad during these first three games far from it actually
nba,not_removed,without the inches i think its a valid statement
nba,not_removed,isnt he that sweaty guy you work for
nba,not_removed,cant argue with that
nba,not_removed,it was a problem for us last season too sullinger was our best rebounder and hes no longer here im not sure who will pick up the slack
nba,not_removed,right thats why i said dave hasnt dealt with any of the front office or player problems yet well see what happens it basically made karl give up
nba,not_removed,what about five wins
nba,not_removed,you guys came off a back to back as well which is understandable that some of your players would be gassed the bulls exploited that and dominated on fast break points
nba,not_removed,this season lol our new coach fizzdale has said he wants marc and zbo shooting multiple a night its definitely a new era
nba,not_removed,can confirm am browns fan
nba,not_removed,ouch
nba,not_removed,early burn
nba,not_removed,that ego comes with tony though hes not as good as he is and help win those championships without his ego i agree he needs to accept the role of possibly coming off the bench but its not black and white
nba,not_removed,oh we already love dedmon he speaks for all of us
nba,not_removed,hes essentially mo buckets
nba,not_removed,i told some warriors fan that david lee is an upgrade to west and i was thoroughly mocked i like the guy west its just that hes more of a locker room guy and jump shooter than anything else at this point
nba,not_removed,that mid range jumper is money though hes also a pretty good passer but thats about it
nba,not_removed,he makes a mean stank face though
nba,not_removed,bulls had the mvp and best record in the east not really the same at all
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,lebron is one of the greatest scorers ever arguably the best passer at his position in history one of the premiere defenders of his generation and perhaps the smartest active player you cant say any of those things about westbrook but give him lebrons body he could probably hit and
nba,not_removed,hes no where close to having james build though
nba,not_removed,its going to take the whole team especially guards because sully is gone and olynyk isnt going to save us when he gets back
nba,not_removed,bro he straight told the front office to get cousins traded right when be got appointed he probably hadnt even seen cousins once then how you gon put the blame on the front officeplayers
nba,not_removed,well just give them the championship trophy if that happens
nba,not_removed,lotterybound
nba,not_removed,the browns arent crap theyre shit
nba,not_removed,yeah its black and silver
nba,not_removed,minus the point shooting and less inches of height and reach mo didnt get bullied this bad on the boards its a downgrade i think
nba,not_removed,with fewer buckets
nba,not_removed,im just referencing this season career wise he has a long way to go to honestly be compared to lebron
nba,not_removed,youre right but there are still a lot of similarities in the ability to score pass rebound at an overwhelming level that athleticism and young lebrons mentality to just sometimes take over with brute force speed and power of will id say its as if not more fair than kawhi to mj
nba,not_removed,greatest scorers ever depends on your definition of greatest hes lead the league once in terms of just putting up points there are a lot of guys to consider kobes done it twice durant iverson and jordan arguably the best passer at his position in history for sure one of the premiere defenders of his generation again depends on who is in his generation eg is duncan and how you quantify premiere there are definitely a lot of guys on that list i think lebron is a fantastic defender but hes struggled with a few things early in his career i think lebron is the best since jordan but he isnt perfect at everything i think a taller rw is an interesting comparison how would that height help with other things passing might be one of those because you can see over smaller players so much better
nba,not_removed,what makes lebron such a better scorer than wb
nba,not_removed,karl sounds like an asshole in the matter but things in general were a clusterfuck if he baselessly went in a demanded a trade on his first day and the front office didnt fire him or rescind his offer then they doomed themselves to the basement of the league if he did have some actual base for his demand and the front office sided with the player it enforced that karl was not in actual control of the team and ensured that he would never gain buy in among the players dooming them to the basement of the league
nba,not_removed,if wins
nba,not_removed,how they gonna eat a whole football team
nba,not_removed,kawhi is pippen with a jumper
nba,not_removed,you dont have to lead the league to be considered an elite scorer lebron hovers around the top five every season and usually has a better percentage than most of the players ahead of him hell probably wind up on the alltime scoring list as for defense lebron is quite obviously resting on that end during the regular season but in the playoffs hes quite often the best lockdown guy on the floor when it counts i dont know if id trust any player save kawhi to stop his man than lebron
nba,not_removed,literally every measure totals efficiency and consistency james is taking a more handsoff scoring role this season but hes good for points on shooting any time his team really needs
nba,not_removed,through his first years lebron average on westbrook did on
nba,not_removed,traditionally the head coach doesnt have the ultimate power to make personnel decisions karl agreed to one level of control then tried to assert more power than he had this comment shows you know little about the business of basketball
nba,not_removed,there was no way the front office were gonna fire him after just appointing him especially not our front office which already has a history of being terribly managed what impression would we give if we fire the hc we just appointed the first day he asked to trade the star player there was no way we would have fired him immediately but that doesnt mean the notion of karl wanting demarcus traded went well with our management for sure theyd have some sort of bad impression of karl at that stage and so did the players especially cousins karl was not in actual control of the team this is stupid since when does the hc have absolute control over the trading of players you think divac peja vivek and co would just give karl control and straight trade their star player away heck you yourself would probably never think of trading cousins at that stage if there were people in the room of them wouldnt want to trade cousins and the only one left would be karl you think our front office would just let karl trade boogie when majority of them wouldnt even think about it karl just gave a stupid request and it didnt bode well with everyone thats his fault
nba,not_removed,like i get what youre saying but regardless of what we could have done it would have been a loselose situation for us there was a massive fo power change when karl was hired peted got demoted and vlade took the helm basically the fo that was supposed to back karl got changed so yes its definitely a fo fuck up but vlade was nice enough to give him a chance to coach and to not let him get traded
nba,not_removed,they get a free pass to the playoffs
nba,not_removed,im not sure id only use stats to measure scoring ability with that you can say lebron was a better scorer than kobe i just think lebron is so good all around that scoring gets opened up for him more while hes unstoppable barreling through the lane there are many players that can create a better shot in iso
nba,not_removed,westbrook also shared a team with one of the best scorers in the nba
nba,not_removed,no i understand how it all works and the levels of power that each coach has is relative to their position within the organization tenure relationship with the gm evpofbo pbo and the terms of his employment it is pretty clear that karl didnt have the power to make a personnel move otherwise he would have just traded boogie but he did try to force the fos hand into a me or him scenario by requesting a trade which is basically the same thing that nelly did to the dubs with the horrific webber deal which is not unprecedented the problem is that if the trade is not completed that relationship is completely torched and will generally lead to a toxic locker room the players not giving a fuck what the coach says and a massively shitty season in the win column i said that he put them in a position which they had to either fire him or deal boogie and they did neither leading to a terrible relationship between coach and franchise player
nba,not_removed,that is not what i meant more like the players take precedence over the coach but i definitely see how that is a confusing statement
nba,not_removed,win were back to leading the hearts per minute in the league wins were lol kangz forever
nba,not_removed,hot take lebron is a better scorer than kobe averaging more points on better percentages is definitely better in my eyes
nba,not_removed,yea and since then lebron has had his numbers go down due to his teammates as well its the same argument except lebron is always better wb wont be anywhere near that efficient this year when its him and a bunch of role players
nba,not_removed,youre making a lot of assumptions such as boogie was aware the minute karl made the request karl expected to have that power whereas he likely wrongly gauged the situation before he got there and felt it was paramount to his success as a coach other players also found out instantly and they all instantly lost all respect for karl we the public know everything that happened the reality is that we are looking at tea leaves and its really ignorant to make the assumptions you are nba teams are businesses first and foremost the reality of the situation is they simply hired the wrong guy and found out the hard way the same thing that happens at mcdonalds gas stations and any other company
nba,not_removed,and youre basing this on career averages
nba,not_removed,oh no doubt i was just saying westbrooks scoring numbers wouldve almost certainly been better had kd not been on the team
nba,not_removed,them finding out doesnt have to happen instantly whenever they find out is when everything goes to shit he put them in that situation simply by making that request were talking about it happening now and were when he was still the coach so they obviously found out sounds like youre the one fabricating assumptions
nba,not_removed,i think he basing it on shot selection in general kobe tends to shoot the long midrange shot which is inefficient for the most part and also shoots more in general which lowers his fg lower typically lebron tends to drive more for layups which makes his fg high
nba,not_removed,as opposed to what kobe dominates the peak but he never shot over in his career lebron has done that every season after his rookie year he even hit from if you compare their first thirteen seasons throwing away kobes rookie season kobe averaged less points too
nba,not_removed,i think so too smarter better there are so many factors in basketball that i think its ridiculous to use purely raw statistics to say who is a better scorer i agree that lebron is a better scorer than wb but if all you cite is ppg and fg then youre not very convincing
nba,not_removed,kobe managed to score at with his second best teammate being a tossup between kwame brown and smush parker i think its safe to say lebrons fg would take a hit if he tried scoring that much lebron is a smarter player theres no arguing that im talking about pure scoring ability weve seen kobe attempt and succeed at scoring with guys on him just watch his end of the shot clock compilation videos he can find himself a bucket in just about any situation dwight howard averaged on in with guys like lma and paul pierce below him in both points and fg please try to convince me dwight was a better scorer than those guys using purely statistics is flawed
nba,not_removed,dat shit look astouding
nba,not_removed,hes so good people complain about his flopping a lot but god damn is he good
nba,not_removed,thats a lob
nba,not_removed,that crossover was disgusting also just a nasty play all around
nba,not_removed,what was the point of this post
nba,not_removed,can you not
nba,not_removed,indians blew a lead
nba,not_removed,dont let the rockets beatdown distract you from the fact that the warriors blew a lead in the finals
nba,not_removed,cool stats bro did you know that the warriors are the only team in finals history to blow a lead
nba,not_removed,i got this as a pm a few times from similarly trollish account nothing to see here
nba,not_removed,anyone who takes this guy seriously is the real idiot
nba,not_removed,lmao wtf is this
nba,not_removed,fuck off
nba,not_removed,thats nice but the warriors blew a lead in the nba finals
nba,not_removed,and lol check out this guys post history
nba,not_removed,lead
nba,not_removed,idiot
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,well damn
nba,not_removed,ok more days till the game who knows who wins
nba,not_removed,great post tell me more s
nba,not_removed,rockets lost to the warriors in games with the warriors back to back league mvp missing the whole series also warriors win the finals in if draymond isnt suspended bogut doesnt get injured and curry and iguodala dont have to play through injuries
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,to remind you warriors fans are who they are despite everything that has happened
nba,not_removed,check his flair thats all you need to know
nba,not_removed,cool comment bro did you know that the last time the rockets made the finals was probably before you were born
nba,not_removed,something along the lines of harden is a fruad kiss the ring i think that a lot of rockets fans have gotten those
nba,not_removed,rockets lost to the warriors in games with the warriors back to back league mvp missing the whole series also warriors win the finals in if draymond isnt suspended bogut doesnt get injured and curry and iguodala dont have to play through injuries
nba,not_removed,both warriors and durant lol
nba,not_removed,rockets lost to the warriors in games with the warriors back to back league mvp missing the whole series also warriors win the finals in if draymond isnt suspended bogut doesnt get injured and curry and iguodala dont have to play through injuries
nba,not_removed,op is a newly created account way to jump the gun
nba,not_removed,what does that even mean lol you sound just as bitter
nba,not_removed,lol just clump us all together good job
nba,not_removed,so im good nice try though at least my team didnt have to wait years to win another championship
nba,not_removed,thats a lot of ifs your team with the best regular season of all time and the first ever unanimous mvp back to back choked their asses off and embarrassed their entire team and fanbase you guys are a running joke hahahaha
nba,not_removed,i mean its pretty obvious this is his alt account for obvious trolling and he has another account to be more subtle if you need help finding his real account look at the comment history of replies to this thread
nba,not_removed,doesnt mean warriors fans dont feel the same way about the rockets
nba,not_removed,must suck to wait years to have a good team then they find a way to historically fuck it up in the middle of their run
nba,not_removed,we do have a favorable history against houston but anyone who posts shit like this is an idiot seems more like a warrior hater on a bum account trying to create more hate people on here talk way more shit about the warriors than warrior fans talk about other teams every great team gets hate still worth it
nba,not_removed,not only that but to be reminded on a daily basis
nba,not_removed,think your sensitivity and defensiveness says it alltake it easy this is the internet comments sectionthe op is a troll post and yet theres a need to be doing forensics on his comment history etc etcwarriors fans should embrace the villainy in good humor like the team does
nba,not_removed,id feel bad for them if they werent so good and their bandwagon fans so annoying
nba,not_removed,did you read my comment i did embrace it i did no forensics other commenters brought light to his account but again quick to label us sensitive im okay being the villain better than having no team at all
nba,not_removed,yep honestly that game thread thursday night is going to be so toxic i cant wait for it
nba,not_removed,dam i smell the salt already

nba,not_removed,i like baron and bosh isiah been doing this sonce nba on nbc so hes smooth c webb and kg look nervous
nba,not_removed,i like them getting bosh finally involved hes definitely an introvert by nature but i knew that already
nba,not_removed,giving us the normal crew twice a week for a few weeks then sticking us with players only on mondays for a month is cruel and unusual punishment
nba,not_removed,somebody needs to tell these guys kyle lowry isnt out for the entire season
nba,not_removed,i think cwebb is doing a good job as the facilitator and just like when he was on any given wednesday i love hearing bosh speak
nba,not_removed,i miss shaq
nba,not_removed,im meh on these other guys but i still really like webber as an analyst

nba,not_removed,does webber know lowry isnt out for the season
nba,not_removed,hey quick questions anyone know of an nba trade machine with draft picks
nba,not_removed,i think i might like the players only game broadcasts more than the regular its a nice change of pace at least
nba,not_removed,i usually dont mind zeke but he seems to have no idea what he is talking about
nba,not_removed,webber groaning is so awkward
nba,not_removed,i thought players only is alright its not the regular crew but its not terrible
nba,not_removed,man isiah is breaking this matchup down beautifully
nba,not_removed,man cavs are so scary now with dwill and bogut
nba,not_removed,kenny 😒
nba,not_removed,well never get that with these guys
nba,not_removed,when shaq and chuck are on the same page theyre are the best duo i swear
nba,not_removed,rip in peace

nba,not_removed,super smart dude
nba,not_removed,and next month we probably wont get kenny or charles at all during march madness
nba,not_removed,thank you
nba,not_removed,i miss chuck
nba,not_removed,taking shots at steph now
nba,not_removed,yeah i was wondering this as well i thought he will be back for the playoffs
nba,not_removed,if he didnt know something realy important like the number of timeouts his team has left you cant really blame him for not knowing a trivial thing like lowrys injury and how long hes out
nba,not_removed,yeah its their first show but kg needs a lot of work
nba,not_removed,fps per second
nba,not_removed,i miss ernie
nba,not_removed,i miss ej and kenny
nba,not_removed,it is so awkward having him in area should just get him on the main show
nba,not_removed,i miss kenny
nba,not_removed,i miss underdog
nba,not_removed,i miss put that on a tshirt
nba,not_removed,peeler was such a beast for us in led the league in

nba,not_removed,to be fair ibaka grabbed lee like he was going to give him a rock bottom
nba,not_removed,wow didnt even notice that horrible
nba,not_removed,i actually think hes right on this one ed at least thats a foul
nba,not_removed,wow why did ibaka do that
nba,not_removed,love when all three officials in the game are watching the ball instead of the of the play
nba,not_removed,thats a definite foul great catch lee
nba,not_removed,damn thats pretty egregious
nba,not_removed,this shit doesnt get called but marcus smart elbow tap does
nba,not_removed,fined
nba,not_removed,thats worst than any screen kg used to set and thats saying something
nba,not_removed,wellit sucks when youre on the receiving end thats for sure
nba,not_removed,nope i didnt see anything looked clean if you ask me
nba,not_removed,lees wrong though well never catch a break
nba,not_removed,they probably would rather the knicks win off a melo than a courtney lee free throw
nba,not_removed,shots i think raptors had a foul to give no and melo did get a great look at that too
nba,not_removed,demar got a missed call against detroit at the end of the game they never call em at the end
nba,not_removed,still happy the traps won
nba,not_removed,its sad that every other knicks player or someone from the organization keeps making excuses on almost everything
nba,not_removed,melo shouldve hit that shot
nba,not_removed,welp now you took an l and youre getting fined but i guess this makes up for when melo blatantly stepped out of bounds last year
nba,not_removed,because they never call it in really late game situations they really swallow their whistle off ball
nba,not_removed,tom brady suspended games
nba,not_removed,this isnt westworld
nba,not_removed,it wouldve been two free throws and possession
nba,not_removed,two shots and possession is automatic if the ball hasnt been inbounded yet at the end of a game
nba,not_removed,we are not the traps
nba,not_removed,thats an obvious foul though
nba,not_removed,yeah ive seen that happen a lot of times people hug other players and stuff grizz vs warriors ot game had that
nba,not_removed,youre not not the traps
nba,not_removed,not saying it wasnt though its just that every week were hearing excuses from the organization and its players if anything they shouldnt have let it go down to the last few positions and then pointing out fouls which are very rarely called to begin with and then talk about chemistry issues coach mentioning they had a foul to give and told his players practices being weak etc
nba,not_removed,it is likely to stay that way too i would assume
nba,not_removed,this was almost the first question i asked myself after finding out he had dropped thanks for the info
nba,not_removed,he went for with assists id say the better performance
nba,not_removed,what are the best items to use to jerk off with
nba,not_removed,kgs career high is also coincidence i think not
nba,not_removed,unless theres a guy drafted in named isiah thomas who drops sometime in his career
nba,not_removed,debateable
nba,not_removed,that game was triple ot tf are you talking about better performance fuck outta here with that give it another mins to play and he was on pace to drop
nba,not_removed,tweezers
nba,not_removed,with one good ankle
nba,not_removed,he just had a point quarter
nba,not_removed,barbed wire
nba,not_removed,a rake
nba,not_removed,i dont know why but i think my username is kinda relevant here

nba,not_removed,al faroq aminu folows back nearly everyone on twitter not sure if youd want his follow considering the recent controversy regarding him but yea
nba,not_removed,what happened to aminu
nba,not_removed,you saying op is gay lol gilbert has some crazy opinions but people still follow him too
nba,not_removed,there was a popular post on this sub with someone digging up old nba players tweets and he had a lot of homophobic tweets before he got to the nba i think edit here is that thread
nba,not_removed,no im setting a disclaimer in case op isnt comfortable with tweets like that you dont have to be gay to disagree with homophobia
nba,not_removed,thank you
nba,not_removed,he definitely doesnt tweet like that anymore he wouldnt be in the league if he still did
nba,not_removed,sure but whether or not op is comfortable with following someone with a tweet history like that is up to him not to you
nba,not_removed,shits still funny to me idc never thought id see kg on tv like this
nba,not_removed,no one is forcing you too watch it bruv
nba,not_removed,sometimes you dont think it be like it is but it do
nba,not_removed,whats the point of this post just dont watch it we dont care that you dont like it lol
nba,not_removed,he also needs to stop swaying back and forth smacking the basketball all the time
nba,not_removed,man
nba,not_removed,i like our discount faried he is a lot of fun to watch
nba,not_removed,a monster
nba,not_removed,top center in the southwest division
nba,not_removed,i love this guys energy man its like he drinks a can of red bull each play and just keeps going
nba,not_removed,that first bucket was so dope post moves like that seem to be dead these days
nba,not_removed,thats like points on a normal offense
nba,not_removed,might turn out better decent jumper and handles
nba,not_removed,no a red bull
nba,not_removed,well hes only so i dont think most people would even consider him a center
nba,not_removed,in modern day basketball i dont even think height for positions matter anymore ie antentookoompow draymond
nba,not_removed,fair he usually does play the though he only plays the out of necessity eg capela being injured
nba,not_removed,hes been playinf the all year he doesnt have the shooting to play the
nba,not_removed,t jones didnt have the shooting to play but he started for a whole year
nba,not_removed,and we sucked lol
nba,not_removed,i asked my barber for a clippers logo hair cut for the playoffs he gave me a fade
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,ive lived in southern california my entire life and the first clippers fan i ever encountered was an australian on reddit
nba,not_removed,the clippers blew a lead in the playoffs before it was a meme
nba,not_removed,the clippers has always been selfroasting their logo for years was literally an inaccurate drawing of a basketball
nba,not_removed,the clippers are worse than the mods
nba,not_removed,the mods started off so good with posting these threads on time but have dropped off in consistency considerably we need to let them retire before doc rivers signs them
nba,not_removed,tomorrows team i think you mean next weeks team
nba,not_removed,the clippers are the third most loved basketball team in la
nba,not_removed,taylor swift has a banner in the staples center rafters
nba,not_removed,the milwaukee bucks have been to the western conference finals more recently than the clippers
nba,not_removed,i hope clippers fans are enjoying being one of the last two teams playing at something nba related
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,this was posted a few minutes after someone mentioned they forgot about the last roast
nba,not_removed,the clippers needed dirty fuckin dan gilbert a free agency kidnappingcoup a former championship winning coach a round phenom out of oklahoma and a new owner to consistently get bounced from the playoffs
nba,not_removed,the clippers are such an afterthought that the mods just realized that we havent roasted them yet
nba,not_removed,we already roasted the celtics
nba,not_removed,this roast could have been the one but david stern blocked it
nba,not_removed,the clippers title chances are on par with sterling winning a naacp award
nba,not_removed,why does never shoot times in a row because his clips only have rounds in them blake griffin is like a modern automatic car incredibly fast athletic smart and no clutch i named my dog austin and it learned how to turn over one time dj missed two free throws and got subbed out he was so upset that he threw his gatorade in disgust but still missed the trashcan they named our mascot chuck after jamal crawfords shot selection our jerseys the clippers really struggle in the playoffs because the players are never really focused in fact the only time i can really think that any player was locked in was deandre jordan last summer no one seems to know this but was an exceptional track star in high school as well as basketball he was originally a runner but because wasnt fast enough for it so he moved to because although wasnt especially fast during the first lap he never got passed in the second round
nba,not_removed,welcome you are now entering sob city
nba,not_removed,lets go easy on this team if it gets too personal someone will beat up a team manager
nba,not_removed,the raptors made it to a conference finals before you did
nba,not_removed,donald sterling wasnt racist he was just misunderstood he knew that black people have been through so much and didnt really didnt want to put them through any more torture by subjecting them to watching the clippers
nba,not_removed,i wanna spend a week roasting the mods for what they did with these roasts
nba,not_removed,finish dead last again
nba,not_removed,brandon bass is store brand draymond green the box looks like what you want but you can tell by the price difference its nowhere near as good
nba,not_removed,as a knicks fan fuck paul pierce as an nba fan i gotta respect his game and his career trajectory legend with the celtics had some big moments with the nets was a great roleplaying glueguy sfbackup pf and a great presence in the locker room for the wizards then after hed given his all bringing them to the playoffs he went to his old coach to give it a go for one more ring now that i think about it a roleplayer glue guy sf is exactly what the clippers always need just think if pierce had just gone to the clippers in instead of the wizards they wouldve had an honest chance at a championship
nba,not_removed,didnt mind waiting for this roast seeing as well probably be waiting longer for that championship
nba,not_removed,the roast threads have been so crazy the last few weeks showing up at crazy times if at all it doesnt make sense did doc rivers become gm of rnba
nba,not_removed,your star player looks like if bill cosby and carrot top impregnated an amazon and then roll the baby around in cheetos
nba,not_removed,our uniforms are so ugly that of the most marketable players in the league arent selling jerseys
nba,not_removed,the onion said it best
nba,not_removed,your players are more famous selling state farm insurance and kias than actually playing good basketball
nba,not_removed,clippers fans are just people that are too poor to afford lakers tickets
nba,not_removed,la clippers more like la shitfaces that cant make it passed the second round because theyre shitfaces
nba,not_removed,it took a racist rant about a laker great to make the clippers relevant in la
nba,not_removed,you know what i changed my mindim going to the clippers roast httpswwwredditcomuserreallyponderous please apologize to the dallas roast s
nba,not_removed,the raptors and clippers never made the finals but the raptors only been around for years whats the clippers excuse
nba,not_removed,idk guys i think the clippers are pretty cool
nba,not_removed,if you think the logo is bad check out the inexplicable universallyhated mascot
nba,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvhhgebpohs
nba,not_removed,the song friday by rebecca black had more depth than the clippers bench
nba,not_removed,for many years i thought the clippers logo was a badly drawn igloo
nba,not_removed,the gap between roasts felt as long as the clippers playoff drought in the and
nba,not_removed,damn donald sterling would have been a better owner for these roasts than the mods have been
nba,not_removed,ho ho waited for our turn
nba,not_removed,no one cares about these roasts just as much as anyone actually cares about the clippers
nba,not_removed,what did the clippers come last in that puts them as the roast
nba,not_removed,this sub has lame insults these are all loweffort non offensive jokes come to rnfl to learn proper trash talk
nba,not_removed,bringing black on black crime to new places like kidnapping and forced entry into a contract 🍌🚤
nba,not_removed,fuck the clippers they act like theyre hot shit when they only became relevant owing to david stern infamously vetoing the trade they still managed to squander best years their previous owner was a fat stupid racist prick in donald sterling who went through a sham divorce now called off with his wife shelly sterling in order to best preserve the value and profit off the team when they sold it and guess what that nasty cunt shelly sterling is the clippers official fan which is actually included in the contract language of selling the team she has the only flopping pussy on the team bigger than blake griffin their real fan clipper darrell is an elaborate con artist which still makes him more ethical than the teams ownership their new owner steve ballmer is a cocksucker that cratered microsofts stock surrounds himself with yesmen and is primarily famous for being a horrible ceo partial to dirty corporate intrigue stealing the ideas and inventions of others and jerking himself with the deluded notion of being even a poor mans steve jobs but hes really just a tawdry pathetic imitation that noone really likes much as the clippers are to the lakers they bring about as much value to staples center as a tick infestation being the nba equivalent of squatting crack addicts they have no banners and not a single player in their history whose number deserves retiring doc rivers can suck a dick the most ludicrous example of nepotism in nba history giving his shitty son an overpaid contract
nba,not_removed,we hang on to our hopes of getting to the wcf as well as we hang on to jamal
nba,not_removed,i was gonna make a joke but i have a lakers flair and im afraid the clippers might try to cover it up
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,the clippers were so close to making the second round last year both and blake griffin simultaneously became injured to avoid it
nba,not_removed,the clippers black alts are so much better than the other two uniforms that even donald sterling is thankful they exist
nba,not_removed,i want to participate in this roast but im not very good at jokes i guess ill just sit and watch like deandre jordan in crunch time
nba,not_removed,this is the first finals has ever made
nba,not_removed,was the order of the roasts ever disclosed yet no idea what the clippers are last at
nba,not_removed,please mods roast me after you guys
nba,not_removed,wasnt there a post a couple days ago listing the top scorers for the roast i thought this was already over
nba,not_removed,the clippers need to start hanging up their playoff wins as championship banners
nba,not_removed,i thought key mod got injured so our roast hopes was postponed for next season
nba,not_removed,can anyone tell me what factor the order of the team roast is based
nba,not_removed,the clippers will complain that this comment is a foul
nba,not_removed,theyre still only one player away from getting to the finals sadly the one player they need is a lebron or a durant
nba,not_removed,i would saw something mean about the clippers but i dont want blake to break my face
nba,not_removed,why is this roast the last round of roasts when the clippers will never go there
nba,not_removed,meh
nba,not_removed,no good clippers
nba,not_removed,steve balmer is the joke version of mark cubanwhich is saying something
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,doc austin and the entire rivers family arent new when it comes to roasting
nba,not_removed,donald sterling is better at managing than these mods
nba,not_removed,eight winning seasons in years that is all
nba,not_removed,youve been around since and you havent had a single trip to the wcf who said the raptors were bad again
nba,not_removed,they are the clippers enough said
nba,not_removed,the end of this roast is gonna be horrible cause all the good roasters will be injured
nba,not_removed,just google clippers team history
nba,not_removed,if the lakers are the in n out of so cal basketball then the clippers are jack in the box tacos if only they werent given out at lakers games
nba,not_removed,not even disappointed that they are last
nba,not_removed,i thought we roasted the lakers fans a couple weeks ago
nba,not_removed,casual fan trying to fit in with the nba talk at work just say fuck the clippers and theres a chance your coworkers will agree
nba,not_removed,jesus christ mods get your shit together dont agree to have roasts for every team and then just post them whenever you feel like it its really not that hard someone else had to come in and post it before you guys actually could also fuck the clippers or something
nba,not_removed,viva la revolucion
nba,not_removed,whatever you do dont bring magic johnson to one of their games
nba,not_removed,that is all
nba,not_removed,game
nba,not_removed,im not even mad about the botched chris paul trade anymore if it wasnt for basketball reasons the most accomplished point guard in clippers franchise history would have been httpimgurcomdcsmnrl
nba,not_removed,steve balmers so dumb he spent billion to acquire the clippers
nba,not_removed,doc and austin rivers are the poor mans coach carter characters
nba,not_removed,whats the point of this roast like all things clippers its proabably going to play out in the first hours at that point some self deprecating fan is going to find a mod and punch him and miss out on the cool part of the roast when the jokes are unique but nobody cares except clippers fans eventually people begrudgingly will look at this roast and in a few hours it will slip out everyones mind theyll go back to the lakers roast and enjoy the overall shitty quality of overplayed jokes so once again why does this roast exist
nba,not_removed,i was surprised to find out how long we had to wait to roast the clippers until i found out
nba,not_removed,i had a sick burn planned but blake threatened to kick my ass if i posted it
nba,not_removed,i was going to make posts but i wasnt able to make it past the second round
nba,not_removed,dont matter if theyre a playoff team or not they will always suck great at wasting talent though brand paul griffn dj maggs kaman good stuff since nba reddit hates the warriors now how about they force the warriors to adopt the clippers gameplan for the past years
nba,not_removed,the clippers thanks ill be here forever
nba,not_removed,modsboom roasted
nba,not_removed,fuck the clippers they have a stupid name and a stupid logo lets give seattle a team again
nba,not_removed,the clippers dont need a roast day when they already have a roast month in may of every year the clippers roast themselves right out of the playoffs
nba,not_removed,i played a kid who said his favorite player was chris paul he proceeded to repeatedly flop and get in the refs face truly embodies his role model
nba,not_removed,more whine than a vineyard haha wubalubadubdub
nba,not_removed,i dont even know doc rivers sons first name
nba,not_removed,fuck the clippers
nba,not_removed,just dont put this roast on instagram for the world to see
nba,not_removed,fuck the clippers
nba,not_removed,blake griffin looks like donald trump with black guy wannabe hair
nba,not_removed,congratulations clippers this is the first finals youve ever reached
nba,not_removed,clippers are the to last teamdamn yall cant be the final anything
nba,not_removed,he probably had no good clippers to give you a proper cut
nba,not_removed,you played your game really well against the clippers i heard doc wants to sign you
nba,not_removed,this is the best one fs
nba,not_removed,ah i remember people putting tracy on that
nba,not_removed,saving this for when the clips choke again this upcoming season
nba,not_removed,serious question are there even clippers fans in la i mean before they got good
nba,not_removed,i knew one dude in high school
nba,not_removed,we did it before it was popular
nba,not_removed,to give up a point lead in game with josh smith of all people raining buckets and dwight and harden on the bench is the most clippers thing you could ever do
nba,not_removed,holy fuck lol how was that unnoticed
nba,not_removed,the clippers need to design a logo with actual clipper boats
nba,not_removed,the second one looks like they tried to fix the first one but there was too much shame in trying to fix it a second time so they gave up and hoped no one would notice
nba,not_removed,so bad their roast got put off for two days later
nba,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°╯╲卐卐卐卐 dont mind me just taking my mods for a walk
nba,not_removed,mods are awesome upvote party edit so much disrespect towards our mods without them this sub wouldnt exist theyre spending their time in order for us to enjoy this sub fucking ungrateful spoiled brats edit everyone that hates the mods should be banned
nba,not_removed,lakers ucla basketball sparks usc basketball clippers
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,for some reason this is the only one that bothered me
nba,not_removed,well the clippers have division titles to hang their hats on so ha
nba,not_removed,so do the sparks
nba,not_removed,holy shit that is amazing
nba,not_removed,the minneapolis lakers have been to a conference finals more recently than the clippers
nba,not_removed,at least we won at something this year
nba,not_removed,thats not even a roast thats just a fact
nba,not_removed,the nba live logo is nicer than the clippers logo
nba,not_removed,clipperart
nba,not_removed,i always thought the clippers logo looked familiar
nba,not_removed,you know you have problems when the second rate nba simulator is blazing you
nba,not_removed,the clippers would still have been decent even if chris paul didnt get traded to the clippers eric bledsoe and darren collison would have been nice
nba,not_removed,no im dirty dan
nba,not_removed,thats not fair at least doc had a decent gm in boston to get him good players
nba,not_removed,fuuuckk
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,you mean
nba,not_removed,at least well avoid the balls
nba,not_removed,fuck my sudden realization game went too far edita word
nba,not_removed,i mean the comment quality dropped off significantly like paul pierces ability to play basketball
nba,not_removed,still ahead of seattle though
nba,not_removed,this isnt really a diss we just added him and everybody agrees with you
nba,not_removed,not even harden jsmoove and brewer
nba,not_removed,i too love business school
nba,not_removed,youre waiting for a clipper boat at the airport bro
nba,not_removed,cant believe youd disrespect the goat austin rivers like that
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,fuckin gotem
nba,not_removed,too far
nba,not_removed,we suck historically thats why
nba,not_removed,hey its a clippers fan get him
nba,not_removed,define universally
nba,not_removed,dam son this sounded therapeutic for you
nba,not_removed,thatll be dollars for todays session
nba,not_removed,holy fuck dude
nba,not_removed,look at those beautiful black alternates
nba,not_removed,considering dj plays during crunch time and crunch time means off ball fouls are free throws and possession meaning theres no reason for dj to be sitting your attempt at a joke is rather bad but i expect nothing less from a fan
nba,not_removed,field goal percentage from feet clippers were actually first bulls were last
nba,not_removed,field goal percentage from feet bulls had the worst percentage clippers had the best
nba,not_removed,then why did you buy him a steph curry jersey
nba,not_removed,id gladly be a joke it if means ill be billion dollars richer
nba,not_removed,original
nba,not_removed,im not a mod a mod stickied this plus a lot of the mods are on vacation or lazy
nba,not_removed,this doesnt make any sense
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,his name is of a city that the clippers should relocate to
nba,not_removed,what
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i bet you if you look hard enough youll find two good clippers around here
nba,not_removed,i lived in san diego for years and ive met exactly one clippers fan he also happens to play for the clippers so im not sure if that counts
nba,not_removed,the clippers most famous fan isnt even from la
nba,not_removed,me i even have the ticket stub to prove it seriously though never met one for a good years until i took my drivers test just had some friendly banter with the driving instructor he was like ill pass you if you have lakers tickets nah im just messin im a clippers fan
nba,not_removed,serious answer ive lived in la all my life and i actually met billy crystal once hes the only clippers fan i ever met prior to the last couple years
nba,not_removed,clippers preblake griffin didnt really have fans per say but they still had decent attendance the clippers were that team where youd go if you wanted to see pro basketball for cheap especially if an all star was coming to town like ai or mcgrady or someone good lakers tickets have always been pretty expensive so the clippers were the team you would see if you couldnt afford the lakers i knew some people that followed both teams in the cuttino mobley maggette and elton brand era and few fans who started to switch because they were pissed that shaq got traded other than that the clippers were pretty much nonexistent i didnt hear any clippers talk on the radio i didnt see their games on tv and they were barely talked about in the newspaper even now its a bit of a culture shock to see so many clippers billboards around the city even with stars like jordan paul and griffin
nba,not_removed,yup there were a few but we were here i got interested in that in the early my fandom really took control when cassel and brand led them in the playoffs httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqfzacfpdcao with cat mobley maggette kaman livingston vlad rad q ross then stuck around for more bad years but still loved the teams and learned to appreciate each and every win i think thats why im more forgiving than a lot of clips fans who joined in the era if you were around during the bad years then you cant take any winning for granted
nba,not_removed,i know one serious one but there are other laker fans that are suddenly clippers fans but to be fair most laker fans hate the clippers
nba,not_removed,there are more fucking warrior fans than clippers fans and by a huge margin
nba,not_removed,vince staples
nba,not_removed,damn clipsters
nba,not_removed,hipster chokers
nba,not_removed,lol and to follow up by picking him up the following season only for him to have his worst season ever
nba,not_removed,cuz its like combined with a barbers hair clippers see rshittydesignbriefs
nba,not_removed,for real
nba,not_removed,yikes
nba,not_removed,i was joking fwiw mods here are great besides finishing this roast thing
nba,not_removed,dont forget the warriors
nba,not_removed,put whatever basketball team mexico can throw together above the clippers too
nba,not_removed,csun basketball
nba,not_removed,god i hate dat ho
nba,not_removed,youre welcome
nba,not_removed,yeah they won a championship lol
nba,not_removed,so have the sonics
nba,not_removed,how many times would those two and vinny del negro have lead the clippers to the playoffs even with blake sterling was still the owner and not seemingly going to do much to make the team competitive for a title until chris paul became realistic no competing let alone contending for anything without chris paul
nba,not_removed,fuck you dan gilbert
nba,not_removed,thanks pal
nba,not_removed,new orleans agreed to trade to lakers but the league had ownership rights while they were lining up a buyer so david stern veteoed the trade as too lopsided for lal it totally was
nba,not_removed,hasnt he won several
nba,not_removed,fuck that guy
nba,not_removed,you better watch your mouth or else im going to get ibaka over here
nba,not_removed,i dont know is pretty sneakily dirty hes given his fair share of nut shots
nba,not_removed,seattle has a ring
nba,not_removed,i really like that first one they should have stuck with that design
nba,not_removed,savage
nba,not_removed,who are you vivian stiviano
nba,not_removed,chill please
nba,not_removed,ah thank you
nba,not_removed,actually the mods had the best
nba,not_removed,steve balmers such a joke he spent of his billion on the clippers
nba,not_removed,thank you for posting though i was wondering when the clippers roast was actually gonna happen at least they stickied it for everyone
nba,not_removed,no thanks
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,ive lived in sd almost my entire life and dont think ive met a honest to god clippers fan
nba,not_removed,billy crystal has a whole section titled sports on httpsenwikipediaorgwikibillycrystalsports theres only one sentence about the clippers crystal is also a longtime los angeles clippers fan
nba,not_removed,jack nicholson isnt from la either
nba,not_removed,umm nah bro vince staples is poppin right now and hes the biggest clippers fan i know still fuck
nba,not_removed,this is the exact reason im a fan back in the kobe and shaq days me and my uncle would watch the clippers play against various teams like the spurs pacers nets and basically everybody it was awesome cause we got good seats for dirt cheap for a good game
nba,not_removed,basically why im a nets fan growing up the train ride to the izod center cost more then the tickets to the game and there was no way i could afford knicks tickets plus the nets werent bad with kidd jefferson and martin and later carter
nba,not_removed,i didnt see their games on tv we were on channel homie and sure there werent as many fans prelob city but to say we didnt really have any fans is a bit disingenuous there are always going to be people rooting for the underdogs
nba,not_removed,i grew up in la and went to ucla for college and grad school in high school a bunch of us got angry that the lakers traded away nick van exel and eddie jones so we jumped ship to the clippers it just so happened that the clippers became entertaining soon after with lamar odomdarius milesetc also all of us really hated kobe so we just stuck with the clippers
nba,not_removed,same here move to socal in loved watching the squad play but once we got brand i was hooked
nba,not_removed,i really dont mind tbh
nba,not_removed,dear god reminded me how him and lance stephenson sucked ass haha
nba,not_removed,my message is more directed towards the imbeciles that downvoted me for stating facts
nba,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised if there was a team other than the warriors with more fans in la than the clippers
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,la
nba,not_removed,snek
nba,not_removed,lol why would you hate someone you dont know seems like a shitty way to go thru life and youre lying if youre saying you wouldnt hit that
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i know that
nba,not_removed,when he said they woulda been decent i think he means they would have been saved from the crushing blow of even making the playoffs and building hope theyd probably still be hovering around or just below which is a successful clipper season
nba,not_removed,the proposed and briefly agreedupon deal paul to the lakers pau gasol to the houston rockets and lamar odom kevin martin goran dragic luis scola and a firstround draft pick from houston via new york to the hornets cool instead you got eric gordon aminu and chris kaman
nba,not_removed,pelicans are good at being ripped in trades heres looking at you sixers
nba,not_removed,i understand the trade but what about this being the roast
nba,not_removed,seattle is probably more likely to make it to the conference finals too
nba,not_removed,this is what you meanright
nba,not_removed,they should have replaced jerry west with a silhouette of chris pauls flop in that pic
nba,not_removed,cover has been blown donald sterling is a good man
nba,not_removed,i know its a roast but it should be funny at least
nba,not_removed,np
nba,not_removed,sd i know one guy at my school thats a clips fan
nba,not_removed,what teams do you back in sd
nba,not_removed,haha that sentence is the ultimate afterthought
nba,not_removed,lol the are trash and they still have more fans than the clippers
nba,not_removed,its true i got so many im a lakers fan but i love the warriors customers in at my bar this past year it was ridiculous
nba,not_removed,yes
nba,not_removed,bandwagoners
nba,not_removed,i would hit it if i had a guarantee she wouldnt write a song about me
nba,not_removed,lakers got roasted
nba,not_removed,during the trade it could have been kobe dwight artest pau chris chris could have been the fifth player of that lineup but that got denied op is joking that this roast was gonna be the fifth one but that got blocked like the trade
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,honestly i dont really follow sports that much i dont watch football or baseball nearly at all but for both id say i support hometown i just recently got into basketball and like golden state because theyre fun to watch for hockey we have the gulls who just recently became a team again a farm team for the ducks so i root for them and continue to hop that one day the oilers will become a contending team again and i can root for themborn in edmonton where most of my family is from i also have soft spots for the clippers because they were from sd and the flames because they are my dads team oh also nashs suns they were some of the little nba basketball ive watched in my life and i still have a small hated for the spurs because they knocked the suns out of playoffs when i was or
nba,not_removed,just like any clippers postseason
nba,not_removed,thats his point
nba,not_removed,no surprise there considering the history
nba,not_removed,thats pretty sad tbh
nba,not_removed,i would hit it if she said wanna fuck yall are liars lol
nba,not_removed,i know imma get downvoted but for real she has an average as fuck body and if thats the best her face looks with professional makeup artist and stylist i can jerk it if i had to but yea id fuck most women that offered sex for no reason
nba,not_removed,pau was part of the cp deal he was gonna get sent to hou woulda been the one lakers were the team that got roasted
nba,not_removed,its hard to imagine that this team made the super bowl just what years ago oh how the mighty have fallen
nba,not_removed,welcome to la
nba,not_removed,i mean if anyone actually offered like that i couldnt say no thats impossible to turn down
nba,not_removed,from superbowl to gabbert starting
nba,not_removed,havent been back in a while usually when you saw blue and gold it meant you were near ucla
nba,not_removed,the alex smith curse
nba,not_removed,i already stopped going on rnfl you guys cant do this to me here
nba,not_removed,i dont think we should as good as we have been lately im pretty sure were significantly better when favors is available not only does it give us a lot more flexibility with different lineups but him and gobert form an incredible duo
nba,not_removed,someone correct me if im wrong but i think hillhaywardfavorsgobert have yet to share the floor this season i think they should see how that goes before they think about a trade
nba,not_removed,no though if he stays hes gonna have to take a massive paycut
nba,not_removed,as good as gordon is and as much as i love him favors is their best player when healthy imo
nba,not_removed,hill is gonna get prioritised in regards to an extension but i think theyll keep favors as well favors has made a home in utah and likes it there unlike some he stays there in the offseason he may not make as much money but i dont think hed wanna leave when hes a core piece of a team on the up
nba,not_removed,id say they have to keep him assuming his knee clears up the jazz can be a seed with him in and out of the lineup but if they really want to make noise they need him healthy bigs who put up with a complete offensive game and good defense are hard to find him and gobert are a perfect complement to one another when they were out there together last year their interior defense was hands down in the league lyles has shown improvement but hell never be a top option on a team like favors
nba,not_removed,paul millsap would be sick on this team i dont think the jazz would do it though
nba,not_removed,too early to say they need to get a reasonable sample size and see how this starting lineup fits together when fully healthy before making any rash decisions unless they get an incredible offer i agree that it should be on the table though and they will almost certainly need to to trade someone within the next yearish if they want to avoid going balls deep into the tax if im the jazz im a lot more comfortable dealing favors than hayward or even hood a great player for sure but they have more means of replacing him than a wing theyve got lyles or haywardiso joe could play the i dont think dealing favors would be as much about targeting someone in particular as much as it would be getting the best package possible boston and toronto are the only teams that come to mind for me with the assets and needs to try to deal for him
nba,not_removed,well take him will hawes lamb rounder do the trick s
nba,not_removed,not only this but im not convinced that he cant be a stretch he already plays the and he has not shown he can hit the three but he hasnt really tried i believe he is from three this year and that is not reliable but i still think he is a positive player and we need him even though i love hayward i would rather trade him than favors
nba,not_removed,i think they have only played minutes so far
nba,not_removed,oh heeelllll nahhhh
nba,not_removed,i certainly understand where youre coming from but having watched last season when burks favors hood and gobert were injured hayward was still able to lead the team to quite a few solid wins i dont think favors has the ability to control a game quite like that
nba,not_removed,doubt paul would come back to the team he came from but idk
nba,not_removed,favors would be sick in atlanta
nba,not_removed,i just cant see how wed fit his salary in as it comes time for everybody to get paid if we could fit him we would absolutely love him
nba,not_removed,i dont know what would be worse losing him for nothing in the summer or paying him at age i hate it i loved millsap when he was with us but no that ship has sailed
nba,not_removed,and you guys make fun of celtics fans for low balling trades lmao
nba,not_removed,yea id like to see him try it but even if he cant make it out to the three point line i think hes become a reliable enough mid range shooter that he can stretch the floor enough to coexist well with rudy on offense
nba,not_removed,yup youre right net rating in those minutes too better blow it up
nba,not_removed,upvoting everyone cause im torn
nba,not_removed,s thats the joke
nba,not_removed,danny ainge already prepping the lowball trade calls
nba,not_removed,ill take one hayward pls
nba,not_removed,im fairly sure favors had his injury back then too he didnt look like himself those games
nba,not_removed,im not at all i think favors is less important than hill and gobert as well there is absolutely no way in my mind that hes the best player on the team hes a great player i dont want him gone but man i really disagree
nba,not_removed,couldnt see it on mobile
nba,not_removed,what a trade good on ya portland
nba,not_removed,he has become such a huge defensive presence in our paint he times things perfectly
nba,not_removed,great block pretty sure ariza started griping at the ref for a foul right after
nba,not_removed,noooo
nba,not_removed,nope
nba,not_removed,resign
nba,not_removed,resign no i think he will play next year
nba,not_removed,its resign man and youre a writer lol
nba,not_removed,deleted but fuck i hope kd doesnt go to boston
nba,not_removed,it was deleted
nba,not_removed,you it
nba,not_removed,is op just fucking with us
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,he wont its been said all year but hes signing a
nba,not_removed,but after that haha i just dont want him in boston
nba,not_removed,dont look for real madrid or barca of the nba look for the leicester squad the team of underdogs that began to defy all predictions and be great im a bulls fan and as of right now id suggest picking either the washington wizards utah jazz or the philadelphia to support
nba,not_removed,whatwho should i watch on youtubefor example that would inspire awe in me again and help me get back into the groove warriors especially the version lebron westbrook harden giannis it boogie cousins
nba,not_removed,curry last year was amazing to watch no one could stop him theres always lebron and this year james harden is having an mvp worthy season put curry could just take over a game and still could
nba,not_removed,are you saying you missed the lebronsteph curry era just start with those
nba,not_removed,where do you live
nba,not_removed,rudy gobert blocks the stifle tower
nba,not_removed,you could start by watching highlights of guys like russell westbrook and joel embiid whatever u do please refrain from watching most things knicks related sigh
nba,not_removed,just watch the quarters of celtics games the cheeky black leprechaun scoring in that span will make you love basketball again guarantee it
nba,not_removed,if youve been out of the game that long there was this guy named koberetired now but you may want to check some of his highlights he was aight
nba,not_removed,become a sonics fan
nba,not_removed,lakers warriors sixers lakers kings cavs suns heat
nba,not_removed,you never heard of lebron james
nba,not_removed,what benny the bull highlights seriously good mascot
nba,not_removed,just watch the philadelphia and youll be in basketball heaven rooting for the underdog and trusting the process in no time
nba,not_removed,tbh regardless of whatever state the bulls are idk if i could support any other team theyre still quite dear to me despite my inexistent connection to chicagoim just foreign af
nba,not_removed,dont forget
nba,not_removed,man no time in and everyone is being so helpful holy balls thank you
nba,not_removed,all of these joel the process embiid and demarcus cousins imo
nba,not_removed,ive heard of a lebron vs curry debate is that a thing i mean i guess so another comment mentioned it do they hve similar or different playstyles as im asking this im like fuck this im just gonna youtube it
nba,not_removed,thanks holy shit
nba,not_removed,costa rica
nba,not_removed,sad face p knicks i hated them as a kidlol i dont know why
nba,not_removed,i went to a celtics game a couple of years ago as i said i dont know shit about basketball but some guy kevin garnett blew my mind
nba,not_removed,yeah heard he scored almost field goals per game
nba,not_removed,not to diss your team but i have zero recollection of it lol
nba,not_removed,tbh i know that he likes samsung galaxy notes thats what i got lol
nba,not_removed,go for the timberwolves my friend tom thibs is their coach and is trying to build something special with that team of immense potential its been really fun this season for me to watch a bunch of young talented guys figure it out in this tough league we call the nba
nba,not_removed,support being a fan im a bulls fan and only will be a bulls fan but during our current mess i enjoy watching the wizards jazz and sixers playing fun quality basketball and proving themselves in the league i would never buy jerseys for those teams however like i would the bulls because im a bulls fan
nba,not_removed,when i say support i mean watch them play because theyre exciting not root for the over the bulls but i get you
nba,not_removed,go for either the magic or nets
nba,not_removed,things i learned from this lebron james is an angry man
nba,not_removed,how have i never seen this before maybe i should open my eyes
nba,not_removed,ive been watching the nba for years and there are more intriguing current storylines than i can ever remember if you decide to latch on to any particular team you wont be making a wrong decision youll have a rooting interest good or bad
nba,not_removed,lol added boogie right after i posted embiid is a good inclusion
nba,not_removed,its a real thing play styles are nothing alike the thing with steph is he is dominating the game in a way no one ever has before he just pulls up and shoots from basically anywhere on the court and the basket goes in hes a small player dominating with small ball like they told us couldnt be done lebron is more of your typical big allstar player in terms of style although in terms of execution he does it better than maybe anyone but mj
nba,not_removed,the consensus here is lebron over curry lebron is a better all around player and curry is a top or player people just love watching curry pull up more casual fans will probably say curry is better
nba,not_removed,no problem man now i feel like watching me some highlights
nba,not_removed,any popular costa rican playing in the nba start with this bud
nba,not_removed,sarcasm you dont know why u hated the knicks as a bulls fan in the
nba,not_removed,i dont know much about soccer so forgive me if i dont know what im talking about but isaiah thomas is kind of like messi an undersized guy who does amazing things that most people only dream of doing and comes up clutch most of the time i really dont know anything about soccer
nba,not_removed,the guy he is talking about is the polar opposite of kevin garnett in terms of physical appearance and style of play not talent
nba,not_removed,oooh thats a diss dont worry furnaceboy they dont exist
nba,not_removed,omg this is a dream come true im a huge footballsoccer fan and even a mention of supporting another team in rsoccer and you get lynched and called a stupid american for not understanding how to enjoy soccer
nba,not_removed,for the most part i hate american sports football and baseball and i almost hate hockey and its all due to ads gametime but man idk what rules are in place that make every team be able to just have an amazing year in soccer the big teams are all cemented in and thats that cinderella stories for days
nba,not_removed,bahahahahah yeah sarcasm my bad on the clarity
nba,not_removed,meh rsoccer is full of overlysensitive obsessive pricks this sub is way better lots of appreciation threads tons of highlights many memes to enjoy its a good spot to get a mix of basketball content to be honest
nba,not_removed,no nba team fans are as passionate as football fans are so theres that
nba,not_removed,yea theres not a whole of parity in todays nba but its the drama its addicting
nba,not_removed,michael h goldberg the executive director of the national basketball coaches association for more than years who died last week of cancer at theyre wearing bow ties as a sign of respect for michael h goldberg
nba,not_removed,its to honor michael goldberg the executive director of the nba coaches association who just passed away
nba,not_removed,michael goldberg director of the national basketball coaches association passed away last week and a few days and theyve been wearing bowties in his memory he was known for always sporting a nice little bowtie
nba,not_removed,also spotted stevens and budenholzer
nba,not_removed,what are we up to now like days in a row this question is asked
nba,not_removed,it means they like to be choked like pj carlesimo
nba,not_removed,no one knows it was trumps idea
nba,not_removed,damn i guess i forgot how to google i just wanted to make a shitty post so bad thanks
nba,not_removed,i think i even saw hoidberg wearing one which is endearing given his heart condition
nba,not_removed,billy and the thunder coaching staff had them too
nba,not_removed,we needed a bot response
nba,not_removed,be careful about shitty post because most of the time when you see this sort of thing is because someone is going through a rough period and people want to show support or because theyve passed away not being preachy you didnt know just pointed it out so you can take what you may
nba,not_removed,would be easier to enjoy this if someone on stephs current team didnt deliver a way more clutch performance this series skip is beyond moronic
nba,not_removed,you got to give it to skip i read this tweet and legit got furious skip knows how to draw attention
nba,not_removed,come on skip
nba,not_removed,skip you flip flop like its your goddamn job oh wait it is
nba,not_removed,extremely small sample size lets maybe wait to see if they win the title this year before even thinking about making this comparison
nba,not_removed,skip just sees stars not teams
nba,not_removed,skip on a mission to piss us off as much as possible
nba,not_removed,what an idiotic statement
nba,not_removed,ayyy i kinda like this skip guy whoever he is
nba,not_removed,while i do think steph is unreal in late game situations this year kobe was clearly as unstoppable as mj in the playoffs late in the game obviously they werent a very good team but in those late games he made every bucket he could possibly make he would crush teams night in and night out throughout the playoffs denver utah san antonio phx okc orlando boston houston every series he came up huge multiple times i still think kobe in the wcf is the greatest display of playoff dominance in a series in the last years
nba,not_removed,cant disrespect klayyyyyyyyyy
nba,not_removed,rnba triggered skip about to get owned
nba,not_removed,he right tho curry is as clutch as anyone since mj
nba,not_removed,i mean steph himself was pretty deadly in game he went and also hit the dagger floater that sealed the game klay was slightly better in game but curry was unquestionably way better through the entire series
nba,not_removed,whats wrong about what he said its too obvious
nba,not_removed,hey lets see if they can get past a healthy cavs team first i mean they definitely can but im going to fervently doubt them until they force me to acknowledge their greatness
nba,not_removed,this seems pretty defensible to me theres no one id want with the ball more than steph
nba,not_removed,his dagger doesnt mean shit if klay hadnt held the fort in the crucial quarter to comeback when the team is down klay is hitting the shot not curry in this series at least
nba,not_removed,are you a lakers fan
nba,not_removed,skip is that you
nba,not_removed,curry made tons of plays throughout the game to keep the warriors in the game he scored points on ts and was assist away from a triple double like he went from he wasnt just chilling and watching klay
nba,not_removed,its almost as if basketball is a team game
nba,not_removed,yes im just curious whats so blasphemous about what he said to me its clear that steph is a better shooter ball handler difficult shot maker and passer than kobe traits that are extremely important in the clutch like if my team is down with seconds left i wouldnt even hesitate to pick steph
nba,not_removed,why would the cavs do this
nba,not_removed,sources
nba,not_removed,dont believe everything on the internet
nba,not_removed,westbrook and love wont be on the same team until theyre on the lakers
nba,not_removed,i dont think either team benefits from this the cavs already have kyrie and theyll reach an agreement with jr before the season starts
nba,not_removed,nah klove is coming back to the wolves with westbrook westbrooklavinewigginsklovekat doesnt sound half bad
nba,not_removed,the leon smith example is horrible and it was on account of myriad mental and psychological issues does the author think that those things wouldnt have reared their heads in college he could have gone to college that stuff would have come out and then he would have never been drafted at all instead he got a guaranteed contract as a round pick going pro out of high school was clearly the correct choice for him ndudi ebi is another poor example he was also a round pick so he got a guaranteed contract he sucked in the nba which means that he likely would have sucked in college too by skipping college he got paid when he otherwise probably wouldnt have
nba,not_removed,hindsight is and one year of college does not make a player not an idiot
nba,not_removed,yeah who the hell
nba,not_removed,no one youre likely to even recognize didnt know a single name on the list off the top of my head
nba,not_removed,httpiimgurcompdkkiktjpg
nba,not_removed,deandregate thread
nba,not_removed,the lebron free agency craze was a lot of fun we were tracking planes and shit
nba,not_removed,veto trade smh
nba,not_removed,well malace at the palace was pretty damn dramatic
nba,not_removed,offcourt magics announcement that he was hiv positive i think this tops the list because it wasnt just about basketball hiv phobia was still a very real thing then and magics announcement forced a lot of people confront their ideas of what hiv was and wasnt honestly i think it helped change the country oncourt malice in the palace i remember watching it live it was unreal those pistons and pacers absolutely hated each other and you could sense that something bad was going to happen as that game was winding down but then the thing that actually happened was worse than anything you thought could happen and it kept going on and on it seemed like it wouldnt end that was definitely the craziest oncourt drama that ive witnessed and it changed the nba as we know it
nba,not_removed,classic off court
nba,not_removed,spurs to spurs go from being eliminated by the seed grizzlies while rj sucks ass and george hill was our best young player to straight wcf straight finals and sweet sweet revenge in along the way they got revenge on memphis in wcf and revenge on okc from the wcf in the wcf oh yeah and turning george hill into kawhi leonard
nba,not_removed,well a few years ago i tracked dan gilberts plane down to miami where he actually was having a meeting with lebron about his potential return that was crazy
nba,not_removed,kobes rape case
nba,not_removed,artest
nba,not_removed,shaq kobe
nba,not_removed,pacers vs pistons ben wallace ron artest jermaine oneill and stephen jackson
nba,not_removed,knicks gate
nba,not_removed,jordan playing baseball
nba,not_removed,the kobe rape scandal was pretty intense not best in the good sense but i was still pretty young so i didnt grasp what he was being accused of
nba,not_removed,the dwight sweepstakes definitely not as crazy now
nba,not_removed,what year was that
nba,not_removed,kobe shaq feud oh that was fun and malice in the palace
nba,not_removed,lol its funny how they tried to spin that story like it was a complete accident im not saying its incredibly offensive or anyone shouldve been fired but itd like saying insert black player monkeys around knicks lose
nba,not_removed,holy shit somebody got fired over this right
nba,not_removed,you kind of wonder what goes through a persons mind when they think yes this is totally okay to post on the internet its even got my name on it too
nba,not_removed,that day was so funny
nba,not_removed,🍌🚤
nba,not_removed,lbj free agency malace at the palace deandre in my opinion
nba,not_removed,man and it all started with just a thrown cup of beverage
nba,not_removed,this was fascinating you guys should watch the fbi break down of the fight its amazing everything is documented and processed
nba,not_removed,this i wrote my apush final paper on how magics aids announcement was the biggest event in sports history looking at how big his impact was and how major aids was and how much a single announcement influenced society thats probably the all time goat as far as off court stuff goes
nba,not_removed,man you saying it in detail sounds like it was worse than what i felt watching the replay
nba,not_removed,around i think
nba,not_removed,it was way worse than that haha
nba,not_removed,it upsets me that the best day in nba history has already come and gone
nba,not_removed,there was just so much happening from so many sides my goodness
nba,not_removed,serious question what happened
nba,not_removed,chris bosh up vote party
nba,not_removed,theres no need for me to make a more accurate analogy as that could be potentially offensive and that writer ended up getting fired so its all good
nba,not_removed,it was so amazing you could write a short book about everything that happened from broussard and his sources to dj to the clips to cuban to parsons to blakes antics and beyond
nba,not_removed,there was a thread on here where everyone watched this play out live over social media
nba,not_removed,blake with the chair picture was amazing
nba,not_removed,dont forget the emoji war
nba,not_removed,dont forget the emoji war that went viral and paul pierces attempt at joining in lmfao
nba,not_removed,well damn that went from real quick
nba,not_removed,dat banana boat though
nba,not_removed,october is the day turkey celebrates the proclamation of republic of turkey httpsenwikipediaorgwikirepublicdayturkey
nba,not_removed,its anus cancer awareness month
nba,not_removed,didnt his real family disown him or something if so then this is really sweet of the thunder and okc
nba,not_removed,he has only played like games in an okc jersey is this normal does everyone get a day
nba,not_removed,whereas enes kanter has a strong twitter game and
nba,not_removed,why tho
nba,not_removed,is this because it was republic day in turkey the or is this just a coincidence seems like theyre doing this intentionally after his clash with the government and basketball federation
nba,not_removed,am i crazy or does that document say october
nba,not_removed,finally
nba,not_removed,i thought he wasnt going by kanter anymore
nba,not_removed,kanter doesnt deserve this imo i think it has to do with his connections within gulen cult i mean oklahoma has adams and westbrook hell even collison which is a loyal guy deserves more than brain washed big man
nba,not_removed,do they know hes muslim
nba,not_removed,crazy christian community honoring a muslim times they are a changin
nba,not_removed,i hope they lose their team and have useless holidays for nba players that dont even belong to their city anymore
nba,not_removed,in years there wont be one day not named after a thunder player
nba,not_removed,dick move state of oklahoma
nba,not_removed,yeah seems an interesting choice
nba,not_removed,didnt know anal cancer was a thing until now so i guess it worked
nba,not_removed,i remember them being kinda forced to disown him cause the turkish government considers him an outlaw now or some shit
nba,not_removed,hes a follower of preacher fethullah gülen who is considered a terrorist in turkey until the government highly respected him then they disagreed on some issues and now suddenly hes a terrorist kanters support for gülen wasnt well received in turkey especially among the people who support the erdoğan government his father said he disowned him enes said he would take gülen as his new surname i dont know why enes is this much into turkish politics he looks like a religious fanatic when he passionately defends fethullah gülen makes no sense to me
nba,not_removed,just a day in this one year its pretty cool shows how much the thunder mean to oklahoma as well as how much they appreciate what hes done if you read the image in the tweet it lists the reasons for making it kanter day
nba,not_removed,not a ton of stuff to celebrate in that whole city bro
nba,not_removed,look at the picture
nba,not_removed,it was signed on the
nba,not_removed,why
nba,not_removed,does it matter oklahoma city has a lot muslims
nba,not_removed,bro we arent as backward as you think hell we even massively voted against trump and for sanders in the primaries
nba,not_removed,i think thats a part of what makes it nice
nba,not_removed,what the hell is the crazy christian community the state of oklahoma
nba,not_removed,oh ok thats cool too
nba,not_removed,pretty interesting though if things go like this we wont be a republic anymore
nba,not_removed,we woke now
nba,not_removed,he is a religious fanatic not much else to it really
nba,not_removed,especially if you consider that he grew up in switzerland he isnt doing himself a favor
nba,not_removed,oh just for gotcha
nba,not_removed,i can think of one
nba,not_removed,population of okc population of seattle difference of hmm
nba,not_removed,so sulky
nba,not_removed,i went to a pakistani restaurant in okc a few weeks ago we cool that stuff was good as fuck too
nba,not_removed,that was the primaries trump will take oklahoma and he will take it by or more luckily im confident the majority of the country will vote against him oh and for fuck sake my fellow oklahomans please vote yes on state question and
nba,not_removed,not anymore
nba,not_removed,not that hateful i just think itd be sort of funny and i find all the player holidays strange
nba,not_removed,no kidding
nba,not_removed,i thought gulan was the not dictator of the two
nba,not_removed,yah i got a bit confused too when they did it for westbrook
nba,not_removed,a mediocre basketball team yeah sounds like a great trade off for living there hey seattleites if you all want a basketball team you can move to okc and well pay you a year as well to not work still gonna be a no for me dog
nba,not_removed,well a lot more people live in the seattle metropolitan area than seattle itself sf has only about people but the whole bay is around million
nba,not_removed,hahahah youre an idiot
nba,not_removed,lol lets look up the greater seattle area vs the greater okc area or economy which is probably a better indicator
nba,not_removed,just stop
nba,not_removed,is that a joke
nba,not_removed,i hope it was sheesh mahal that place is great
nba,not_removed,johnson has my vote so trump will only win by and screw our ag for getting med mj off the ballot and vote yes on those state questions
nba,not_removed,ah right well its only for this day this year so not a holiday
nba,not_removed,like legendariusss said its a holiday just in not annually its basically saying we appreciate that youre active in the community is there really anything wrong with that
nba,not_removed,its more of a recognition for the good that someone does in a community its not like every october people are going to start wearing fake moustaches its more of a way of saying on this day we want to thank you for being a positive member of our community for everything you do on and off the court
nba,not_removed,they arent holidays pretty much every community announces this day or that day just check your own citys website
nba,not_removed,yep youre right i should mention how much i hate our fucker of a president it still does not change the fact that gulens a cult leader and enes is brainwashed hes our tom cruise lol
nba,not_removed,theyre both dictators one just isnt in power gulen is a cult leader
nba,not_removed,imo russ deserves an annual one though
nba,not_removed,might want to make a doctors appt to get that blood pressure checked
nba,not_removed,i used to feel bad for seattle fans that lost their team but everytime i see one post something on rnba i dont feel bad anymore
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,sorry we dont pay hipsters to live here also you have to personally fistfight a tornado to be an oklahoman citizen so i just dont think itd work out man
nba,not_removed,anger leads to the dark side you know
nba,not_removed,oklahoma voters had a referendum where they approved a ban on sharia law a few years ago it was ruled unconstitutional i thhnk
nba,not_removed,it was indeed
nba,not_removed,just curious why gary johnson
nba,not_removed,yes which part do you have issue with
nba,not_removed,what does he believe
nba,not_removed,the dangers of a high salt diet
nba,not_removed,been like this for years its one thing to shit on an owner or what happened nah they have to shit on where im from like wtf
nba,not_removed,also its okay dollars an hour minimum wage and an actual city people want to visit make me feel better
nba,not_removed,you guys usually lose those fights to tornadoes
nba,not_removed,yeah its because people cant afford it youre a special brand of stupid
nba,not_removed,its not the matter of affording to go to the game we didnt want to support your fuck boy owner cant wait till westbrook leaves and you guys average every night
nba,not_removed,a lot of places have had similar votes because people started using it as a criminal defense
nba,not_removed,because i am a libertarian and he represents me the best that is the cliff note version i can get more detailed if you want
nba,not_removed,well its complicated turkey since mustafa kemal attaturk has prided itself on being a secular state first of all recently especially with the election of the outwardly religious erdogan some are worried that secularity is softening and some it is worth noting are happy with this the military considers itself the guard of that secularity now gulen is an exiled islamic preacher who lives in pennsylvania and has an extensive network of gulenist schools around the world he is accused of using his network of schools to infiltrate the turkish police and military forces with agents who are secretly loyal to him and some allege that he was behind the recent failed military coup in turkey in hopes of usurping erdogan with a military loyal to his brand of islam
nba,not_removed,whatever gulen tells him to
nba,not_removed,no where near the same level man
nba,not_removed,its so remotely different
nba,not_removed,you make minimum wage and yourre proud of that
nba,not_removed,im yet to lose one toby keith is kinda our bad though sorry everyone
nba,not_removed,nah dude its the money in seattle no one in seattle has any money oh wait the two richest people on earth live in the suburbs around seattle
nba,not_removed,the law already outlaws other types of laws
nba,not_removed,yeah im sure thats what motivates the voters
nba,not_removed,uh that is not true as an oklahoman it was bigotry with zero legal ground to stand on having said that a lot of states have passed stupid laws like that
nba,not_removed,interesting id be glad to hear more but its probably not best in a public venue like this
nba,not_removed,it would allow local liquor stores to actually refrigerate their products and for grocery storiesgas stations to sell high point beer this is the norm in almost every other state were a rare exception all this does is modernize our alcohol laws to be more on par with the rest of the country as for the economy im not sure how it helps exactly either it would allow local grocery stores to carry higher point beer and wine which could bring in more sales but it would also allow major retailers like walmart so i dont have answers for that im just voting for it as a consumer who doesnt like having to go to a liquor store to buy warm high point beer when in almost every other state you can just walk into your local grocery store and get it cold
nba,not_removed,ok what does gulen believe
nba,not_removed,i dont but you probably do source you said yourre
nba,not_removed,appreciate your apology for that thought that counts and were sorry for ted bundy and owl city
nba,not_removed,youre right two people in seattle have money
nba,not_removed,he teaches islam that benefits him individually whether it is demanding donations building missionary schools in africa or managing cram schools in turkey all of his advice to his followers makes a profit for him or gains him more followers so its not like he has a cult similar to the lds church or scientology that teaches something completely removed from the holy books islam does not give that much freedom to greedy religious figures instead they try to build a following loyal and influential enough to give them power even though thats a super simplified explanation filled with incomplete analogies to appeal to a western audience it at least gives some perspective on how people like gulen matter
nba,not_removed,if you dont make minimum wage then why did you bring it up that seems odd sorta like you
nba,not_removed,microsoft amazon starbucks all were started here just stop bud were a huge hub for jobs just stop talking now youre gonna hurt yourself
nba,not_removed,wasnt aware of that i also buy tons of buy because i like variety
nba,not_removed,try not to make sense of weird salty fans
nba,not_removed,minimum wage is an indicator of how well the local economy is doing in my city its okay basic economics is hard
nba,not_removed,im just making fun of it cos youre being a cunt
nba,not_removed,and raising it would indicate a society heavily reliant upon minimum wage thats not a good thing regardless of the economic theory you subscribe to but please keep trying
nba,not_removed,our mcdonalds jobs pay more than any hourly job in your city
nba,not_removed,so the economy in seattles economy isnt booming with it not a theory its in action and working also you think people who work for minimum wage thetsat with no extra spending money is a good thing for an economy built on buying and selling youre a genuine idiot
nba,not_removed,i dont understand what youre trying to say thetsat maybe try settling down first and then writing coherently
nba,not_removed,yeah you all are incredible
nba,not_removed,you couldnt use context clues not surprising you seem pretty damn dumb thats at auto correct little buddy not responding to anything else god you are one pathetic soul
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i cant respond to something i dont understand i mean i guess i could just write jibberish since that seems to be your language du jour but keep trying
nba,not_removed,you just googled how is dollar minimum wage bad and gavw me the first link and the funniest part of that is you found an article from that says could harm when its already been happening and working in seattle youre so stupid it literally hurts
nba,not_removed,its okay you cant understand sentences with one mistake in them because your brain cant fill in blanks you mustve really blew your sats if youre that awful at understanding context clues product of that fine oklahoma public schooling system though so its not all your fault
nba,not_removed,dont what does that mean i dont understand anything youre saying because of this typo you
nba,not_removed,its like youre having an argument with yourself ill just let you respond for me since youve already decided how and why but really though somethign that works in seattle doesnt work everywhere this should be painfully obvious to someone who doesnt have their head up their ass secondly and more importantly you fail to address the issues associated with and caused by minimum wage and raising it ie increase unemployment but thats not a surprise because i dont think you actually understand how economics works at a country scale keep on riding on the coattails of those who are successful in your town im sure theyll be happy to continue paying you the minimum whatever that may be later dummy
nba,not_removed,double reply and you responded to yourself the salt is real lulz
nba,not_removed,what does somethign mean i cant respond if i dont understand dummy
nba,not_removed,and keep loving your fracking earthquakes once again not making minimum wage i understand i need to repeat things to you though glad you got your high school diploma in oklahoma but just some suggestions they need to work on sentence comprehension and context clues actually really important in other more literate states but youre still in oklahoma it seems so you should be fine without learning them if you want to rot away in that awful state you guys are literally worse than texas how guy
nba,not_removed,haha not at all im actually laughing and want you to respond you are hilariously stupid you linked me an article from that said it could harm im dying bro please dont stop responding
nba,not_removed,seattles labor market has thrived since the city became the first major metropolis in the country to pass a law setting its minimum wage on a path to per hour the citys jobgrowth rate has been triple the national average for example
nba,not_removed,so an article from a year ago has no bearing thats your out as i said before later dummy
nba,not_removed,kevin should know that all good business is done at chilis
nba,not_removed,if kd is smart hell go where theres free crab legs for life
nba,not_removed,this is turning into a time share free trip to the hampton as long as you go to the meeting
nba,not_removed,i really dont know how its gonna work for the heat whiteside wants to decide early but kd isnt even meeting with them until the and i dont think they can get both unless wade takes the minimum which he doesnt seem to have interest in doing its a very confusing situation please correct me if im off about anything
nba,not_removed,ugh my blood pressure
nba,not_removed,everybody says hes staying but its really interesting how hed meet with all these teams if he was just gonna stay in the first place
nba,not_removed,the kevin durant free agency timeline date location team thursday june okc rthunder friday july nyc rwarriors friday july nyc rlaclippers saturday july hamptons rnbaspurs saturday july hamptons rbostonceltics sunday july hamptons rheat
nba,not_removed,meeting at george constanzas house
nba,not_removed,currently pretending like i havent been texting my boys for the past two years
nba,not_removed,kevin durant has a place in the hamptons
nba,not_removed,so riley gets last say since i believe thunderthurs warriorsfri and spurssat are all before that cool
nba,not_removed,how long are team presentations usually
nba,not_removed,kd getting ready for all his free lunches
nba,not_removed,im hoping the knicks get added to that list if only because hes already in the hamptons i dont think we have a shot at landing him but id like to be in the running
nba,not_removed,ainge is going to provide some epic comedic material come join our pg and jaylen brown
nba,not_removed,toronto
nba,not_removed,its the new golf course small buisness man magazine
nba,not_removed,only if you cant get a table at
nba,not_removed,who do you think he is jameis winston
nba,not_removed,sounds to me like hes just going to hang out in the hamptons forever
nba,not_removed,holy crab in los angeles
nba,not_removed,careful man dont want the warriors to make that dungeness pitch
nba,not_removed,wellit could happen if wade and whiteside make it look like theyre gonna leave then at the last moment are persuaded by riley to stay at discount wade takes the min and gives a speech about ultimately valuing winning over everything whiteside says he wants to stay true to the franchise that made him and plus he loves the south beach lifestyle meanwhile micky arison the real godfather slips them each a few carnival cruise line shares and a couple million in cash to be safe the whole nba is so captivated by the story lines the twistending and rileys genius that nobody looks under the table or we let whiteside walk max wade and rebuild with riley taking a backseat in the franchise
nba,not_removed,blood pressure typical thunder fashion
nba,not_removed,what a life then i go to the hamptons and have people come to my vacation home and try to convince me why i should let them pay me tens of millions of dollars to play a game ive loved since i was a kid
nba,not_removed,you dont
nba,not_removed,pat riley aka the devil himself will make kevin an offer he cant refuse
nba,not_removed,its all according to his plans have the last talk and wow him some way about the heat organization lets hope he makes something magical happen
nba,not_removed,i remember reading somewhere that they can be hours usually
nba,not_removed,thats nba allstar point guard to you buddy
nba,not_removed,he crossed them off the list awhile ago
nba,not_removed,radisson just gives out this vibe oh im doing business at the radisson its kind of snooty
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,lol yep its so fitting
nba,not_removed,classic warriors fan
nba,not_removed,pat riley scares me so much tbh
nba,not_removed,kevin durant to replace nicolas cage in the ghost rider series confirmed
nba,not_removed,well kev last guy who did it got two rings just saying
nba,not_removed,decades ago
nba,not_removed,a vacation mansion in the hamptons might be cheaper than a crappy apartment in san fransisco tbh
nba,not_removed,this indicates the inevitable appearance of garnett on reddicks podcast
nba,not_removed,im kinda curious what kg would be teaching grnt mind games grnt franchise loyalty grnt being a champion grnt anything is possible
nba,not_removed,see i like this better than him coaching being limited to one team that way he can still show up at twolves practice and show up at clippers or whoever just show up to knicks with a bowl of honey nut cheerios dude is a teacher im still pissed off that he isnt staying on with the us
nba,not_removed,brice please take advantage of this
nba,not_removed,im kind of surprised i havent heard anything about danny reaching out to him i would love to see him mentor some guys and maybe have a front office position i think he could do a lot for marcus smart and jaylen brown i guess im still stuck in the kg bleeds green mentality ill have to wait until pierce retires to get one of them back in boston
nba,not_removed,now that bob thate is gone if blake wants kg to be his shooting and post moves coach he should ask kg to become part of the staff
nba,not_removed,if he ever coached im sure the frustration of it would lead him to several concussions
nba,not_removed,will he get paid for this shit
nba,not_removed,pretty sure that he already lives in la and has lived there for years so itll basically just be like going to the gym and hanging out for him does the nba have some sort of rule against this though like if hes at the facility all the time and always helping out players on the clippers its kind of like hes an unpaid coach
nba,not_removed,i have no issues with retired players coming and showing guys some stuff with different teams but i would love to see kg make the guys on the twolves a priority between kat wiggins and even dunn he could definitely show them a thing or two about a thing or two
nba,not_removed,its now my favourite podcast i think it might be the best podcast series that is sport related out there also redick only has one d my man
nba,not_removed,you know damn well redick will try like hell if he hasnt already
nba,not_removed,grnt bar fights passfail only
nba,not_removed,grnt trash talking
nba,not_removed,oncology called a player with alopecia cancer
nba,not_removed,ehh its not that kg doesnt love boston and the celtics but he lives in la lol hes retired now thered be no reason to have him come live in boston for any amount of time its time for him to enjoy family life
nba,not_removed,i think he doesnt want a real job at all like basically he will be retired but spend like days over the season at clippers practices at twolves at celtics etc
nba,not_removed,didnt thibs do something similar last year he would go around the league and help a different coaching staff every few weeks it would be like a advisor role
nba,not_removed,i doubt they would tell him anything itd be like an internship
nba,not_removed,trust us one d is more than enough for jj
nba,not_removed,that come with a lab grnt avoiding melo by the buses
nba,not_removed,and he probably has a closer bond with doc and pierce and sam cassell than anyone currently with the celtics
nba,not_removed,i dont know if he helped or gave advice but he went and observed scott brooks did the same thing
nba,not_removed,the only person still on the celts that was here before kg left is avery bradley
nba,not_removed,i remember him taking notes and watching teams practice and in games i know he was at different training camps last summer but httpwwwcbssportscomnbanewstomthibodeautovisitthewarriorsofferupdefensiveconsulting
nba,not_removed,damn with the guttural german announcers and the unnecessary violence it felt like i was watching downfall
nba,not_removed,one of the craziest hangtimes ive seen on a dunk
nba,not_removed,tmac was spectacular in his prime what a move
nba,not_removed,god i miss having a player like this to bad he literally had no help and grant hill ate all our money
nba,not_removed,lebron has lost out of games since getting in a dad beef with lavar ball
nba,not_removed,who knew shaq was i knew he was great but im still impressed
nba,not_removed,shit is he right behind dirk now o
nba,not_removed,i knew because i saw this stat earlier tonight
nba,not_removed,shaq is awesome no surprise here hes been passed by dirk kobe and now lebron in these years past
nba,not_removed,i think that this sub not you in particular tends to underrate shaq particularly his longevity
nba,not_removed,hes a couple thousand away from dirk whos putting up an admirable fight to keep his spot obviously lebron passes him so im hoping dirk passes wilt to remain in scoring for a long time that would please me
nba,not_removed,i think weve seen shaq on tv so much as an outofshape explayer in the last few years that we forget what a great athlete he was
nba,not_removed,assuming he plays out the rest of the mavs games and scores an average of ppg hes been increasing his ppg steadily as hes been getting healthy over ppg this month thus far he will need pts to pass wilt i think dirks implied that hell only play more season after this so hell definitely need to be a boss and average like to have a chance to pass wilt as well as being mainly injury free its a long shot for sure hoping for the best in any case
nba,not_removed,with teams or more cause some days only two teams play interesting though
nba,not_removed,what the fuck happened went to sleep to prepare for my shift later before all these games started and wake up to this someone please explain how this happened
nba,not_removed,youre all pretty lucky mavs werent in action tonight or this stat wouldnt exist
nba,not_removed,wow considering that some powerhouses like cle sas and lac were playing this is quite shocking if you parlayed all the underdogs you probably could have retired to your own private island
nba,not_removed,shout out to anyone who did that game parlay of all underdogs
nba,not_removed,and my goes vcless for a night
nba,not_removed,not sure what the other qualifications are unless theyre saying that one week ago was the first time that the team with worse record won every game on tuesday nov nyk beat por nop beat atl den beat chi lal beat okc
nba,not_removed,i really wonder how they come up with stats like these
nba,not_removed,lebron sleepwalking out there thats how the cavs lost
nba,not_removed,pretty neat actually
nba,not_removed,what a time to be alive
nba,not_removed,illuminati
nba,not_removed,it was the day of the underdog i should have bought some lottery tickets
nba,not_removed,on the same night a little confused at first
nba,not_removed,ive seen like of these tweets be wrong already this season wish i could fact check
nba,not_removed,utah are a better team than houston anyway theyve just had injuries this is a really good thing it means its a competitive league
nba,not_removed,i remember it also happened in june june june
nba,not_removed,well it was giving tuesday
nba,not_removed,has to be it happens in every nba finals series that isnt a sweep
nba,not_removed,yup confirmed
nba,not_removed,yeah the first time was years ago
nba,not_removed,yeah it literally happened a week ago with teams
nba,not_removed,the basketball gods got bored and decided to fuck with us
nba,not_removed,the cannibalized itself already chaos had to have somewhere to go
nba,not_removed,its the year of the upset
nba,not_removed,magic
nba,not_removed,parity is a myth
nba,not_removed,in terms of betting the pelicans were actually favored against the lakers despite the worse record not sure about the rest of the games
nba,not_removed,a parlay on all three wouldve netted you a little over
nba,not_removed,you just know there is some degenerate in vegas who caught the feelin that the underdogs would take it and placed the bet
nba,not_removed,i did it all on favorites first time i bet on nba in a decade never again
nba,not_removed,yep wheres my lowlights thread
nba,not_removed,games or more my dude
nba,not_removed,at least games that night and games into the season
nba,not_removed,stats company does this shit
nba,not_removed,nwo confirmed
nba,not_removed,spooky teams
nba,not_removed,i assume its regular season only as well
nba,not_removed,mmm chaos is going to have a field day on saturday this was just an appetizer
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,clippers have been on a losing streak not enough for the nets to be favored though
nba,not_removed,thats a bet you throw down when you get to vegas knowing you aint getting it back but hoping some wild shit happens
nba,not_removed,your first ever bet after years was a team parlay
nba,not_removed,and we helped
nba,not_removed,just use ur eyes and take out the parentheses
nba,not_removed,i dunno weeks ago should have sated it of the playoff teams went down that was a pretty crazy saturday heres hoping chaos wins out for the season though my team is unranked now so i just want to see the rest of the world burn
nba,not_removed,it was a two game losing streak now is two games really a streak
nba,not_removed,meant i did a multi bet on favorites not a parlay
nba,not_removed,you know were gonna pay for it next time we play sa though but right now i remain high on pure ecstasy
nba,not_removed,when you are as good as the clips yes
nba,not_removed,theyve both been on fire all of february
nba,not_removed,technically davis and cousins are at in feb since they started playing together
nba,not_removed,what about durant and curry
nba,not_removed,are cousinsdavis not technically doing this
nba,not_removed,lavine gone has a lil to do with this
nba,not_removed,what about the whole season does anyone know
nba,not_removed,whats the most by a duo in a month ever
nba,not_removed,timberwolves fans about to feel what thunder fans feel right now in a couple years
nba,not_removed,too bad it doesnt translate to em wins
nba,not_removed,its been a very warm february as well
nba,not_removed,in the games since the asb kat and wiggins are also averaging ppg
nba,not_removed,ppg
nba,not_removed,they probably dont qualify since theyve only played games together
nba,not_removed,fuck that
nba,not_removed,lmao jesus you got downvoted to shit
nba,not_removed,they swept the magic this year
nba,not_removed,at least our future looks a lot brighter than the magics lmao
nba,not_removed,yeah
nba,not_removed,over the last
nba,not_removed,it all makes sense
nba,not_removed,im gonna pretend this means something and that both duos will have many battles in the western playoffs in the future
nba,not_removed,thats pretty sick
nba,not_removed,tee hee
nba,not_removed,holy shit i just saw that lmao oh well worth
nba,not_removed,the truth makes people defensive
nba,not_removed,lol for the record i didnt downvote you twolves fans must be out here
nba,not_removed,imo its always more important who ends the game as opposed to who starts it if you want to limit iggys minutes to while allowing him to be relevant at the end of the game then taking him off the bench is a great way to make sure you play him in the minutes that are most important
nba,not_removed,i think barnes will get his spot back at least for game if kerr benches barnes now he may lose him for the rest of the series
nba,not_removed,not necessary unless it becomes obvious that the cavs game plan is to get lebron established on offense really early on from what ive seen the cavs prefer getting their other guys touches earlier on its wiser imo to bring iguodala in to check lebron when lebrons on with the second unit
nba,not_removed,but barnes was immense in game as the backup when dray was in foul trouble in the
nba,not_removed,it depends they may want to save iggy in crunch time wear lebron down with barnes on him if its not working kerr can probably tell after one game hell start iggy or try something else
nba,not_removed,that lineup is kerrs ace in the hole he wont bring it out like that again unless he truly needs to
nba,not_removed,he could but he wont unless things get desperate
nba,not_removed,considering that theyre playing lebron next i say yeah they do
nba,not_removed,andre
nba,not_removed,id see kerr starting with barnes to see how he handles lebron then switching to iggy if things get to bad
nba,not_removed,i think their rotation in game was the best its been all playoffs starting was their most efficient then when hb comes in for bogut it becomes their most explosive really liked what i saw despite the slow start
nba,not_removed,nah i dont think so last year lebron was the only threat on cle so they needed him to start even if they need him to lock down on lebron theyd probably bench bogut and go small
nba,not_removed,no kerr will wait for the team to be in serious jeopardy before actually playing his good players his pattern is to aggressively bench iggy until the team is down in the series
nba,not_removed,if you remember bogut didnt even play in the last few games in the finals iggy has to start for lebron
nba,not_removed,think we might have to go small with barnes at the cause tt will probably be too athletic for bogut
nba,not_removed,barnes is trash tbh without andre the warriors wouldnt even be close to what they are now if he starts he earned it
nba,not_removed,nah kerr wont but he should series could be done in games rather than
nba,not_removed,i can see this argument but i disagree if you want iguodala to slow down say kd or lebron on defense you have to align his minutes with theirs
nba,not_removed,and the future
nba,not_removed,barnes is such a confidencedependent player that this is right unfortunately
nba,not_removed,seriously people just looking at the box score wont realize how impressive some of his rebounds and decision making were he had a couple threes rim out too
nba,not_removed,aggressively benching stop with this shit post everywhere already there a legitimate reason for igoudala to come off the bench
nba,not_removed,where iggy is fresh and kd and westbrook are worn out
nba,not_removed,yes and no kd or lebron are going to play minutes a game iggy at this point in his career isnt that guy so you want him to play the most meaningful minutes on lebron the end of the game
nba,not_removed,would be a way around the salary cap
nba,not_removed,ugh i wish this answer wasnt so simple d edit mods fade me im done
nba,not_removed,are you sure i feel like this is a cop out i mean just make rules about it so that youd have to then include the playercoachs salary in full as per usual eg if lebron became coach his potential coachs salary would count against the cap this way if both sides really want to do it theyd have to make it work financially
nba,not_removed,i liked the question my friend thank you for it
nba,not_removed,its not so simple the obvious work around to thisinclude coaches salary in the salary cap expand cap if needed
nba,not_removed,if the playercoach is coaching without compensation for coaching then hes a not really a coach plus the nba coaches association isnt going to like it
nba,not_removed,i think the idea is that a player coach could take a smaller player salary to allow more cap room while taking a massive coaching contract to supplement the lost income
nba,not_removed,thats what i was thinking but then theyd have to make a special exception for some teams which would put the commissioner on the hot seat from other owners
nba,not_removed,i dont think anyone expects or wants it to happen but if it was desired im sure they could work around any salary cap concerns maybe coaches salary is only included for playercoaches but not nonplayer coaches something like that
nba,not_removed,theres no rule saying how the award should be voted right now media members believe that big team success matters more than just big individual stats
nba,not_removed,i think that huge raw numbers on a low seed team are easy to get for any superstar i think you should be rewarded for winning games because that is more difficult to do and requires playing basketball the correct way
nba,not_removed,no and i rather have them fix the fan voting for all stars instead
nba,not_removed,i think the mvp award should go to who gets the most place mvp votes or jimmy butler whichever
nba,not_removed,this is an absurd question this is not a hard and fast rule its just how it goes so its not an actual change its more how voters vote
nba,not_removed,as much as people are saying its not a rule its an unwritten rule if kobe bryant who averaged ppg and was one tim thomas three from getting out of the first round could not win the award then its pretty evident you have to have a successful team to win it
nba,not_removed,no
nba,not_removed,fuck beginning of the season shitposts
nba,not_removed,its easy to put up huge stats when youre the only scoring option do you think harden and westbrook would both be putting up if they still played together
nba,not_removed,if westbrook or ad leads their team to wins and they keep up their play they should win mvp
nba,not_removed,do you think that westbrook lillard davis and harden are better players than lebron curry and durant
nba,not_removed,absolutely not if your team is not good its the best player and solely the best players fault
nba,not_removed,theres no rule saying how the award should be voted exactly not sure what op means by change you cant force people to vote a certain way or at least you shouldnt if you dont want to come off as influencing the judging panel in anyway
nba,not_removed,i think you should be rewarded for winning games because that is more difficult to do and requires playing basketball the correct way would winning games be more difficult for the warriors than the thunder winning say
nba,not_removed,yea thats what i meant in the original post it is an unwritten rule
nba,not_removed,ya
nba,not_removed,nah wins in the west barely gets you to the playoffs
nba,not_removed,contrary to popular belief basketball is not a team sport
nba,not_removed,no but do you think westbrook can keep up what hes doing and lead the thunder to win games
nba,not_removed,its at least as difficult if not harder people underrate the difficulty to make the jump from wins to say i mean how many teams actually manage to win every year its tough to maintain such a high level through games imo its easier to drag a team to seed we literally see it every year most all star level guys with a functioning roster should be able to do that pau in memphis iggy in philly bosh in toronto etc but can those same guys also lead a better team to make that next jump see iggy in denver thats where the lebrons and currys come in leading a seed is very different to leading a true contender
nba,not_removed,really depends on the situation if a player on the warriors and a player on the thunder had at all similar stats then i would go with the player on the warriors because getting those types of numbers is harder to do on a better team i cant give you an exact quantification of how much each is valued but winning does mean a lot when youre separating superstars from superstars
nba,not_removed,that doesnt matter to me as much if they can get their teams to i think they should win
nba,not_removed,agreed not sure why im being downvoted
nba,not_removed,i think they can win outside of the warriors the thunder should be able to compete with any team in the west including the spurs
nba,not_removed,it does work both ways though sure players like russ ad and harden will have very high usage but the looks they get and ease which they can score isnt high compared to teams with multiple superstars
nba,not_removed,thats fair but i dont feel you should get mvp unless youre the best player on your team while being one of the top contender teams
nba,not_removed,the guy you just agreed with was being extremely sarcastic to make fun of how dumb the reasoning behind your post was
nba,not_removed,because you said something stupid
nba,not_removed,they won with kd last season without him this season is absolutely insane
nba,not_removed,with a lot of players that people make this type of argument for their efficiency doesnt get much better when they get a better team westbrook for example has played on win teams with an mvp teammate but was never an efficient scorer anyways kobe as another example was able to score ppg on ts with crap teammates when given incredible teammates his ppg drops to ppg but his ts remains constant at i dont personally buy the idea that a crap team is an excuse for chucking on bad efficiency i think a great team benefits roleplayer efficiency but superstars are going to get theirs in a similar way regardless of their teammates
nba,not_removed,highly doubt that
nba,not_removed,i think thats the point wins and seed does westbrook get mvp hes not top seed but its still super impressive
nba,not_removed,no hes right
nba,not_removed,i disagree
nba,not_removed,when can we induct him into the hall
nba,not_removed,anytime i watch ad he has some really awkward ways of finishing at the rim some of them look really off balance and he takes off from the wrong foot at times yet somehow they all go in
nba,not_removed,damn man his mid rangefloater is so good
nba,not_removed,can we call him the big easy
nba,not_removed,unreal
nba,not_removed,could you imagine ad and giannis on the same team
nba,not_removed,as soon as he grows a bushier brow
nba,not_removed,zach lowe wrote about this early in ads career he said that ad takes and makes the most difficult shots in the entire leagueand he said it might get terrifying if he consistently looks for the easiest shot but still hits weird off hand floaters when needed
nba,not_removed,take a look at his looks made the guy is unreal with unorthodox shots
nba,not_removed,nah fam hes the brow
nba,not_removed,i like it
nba,not_removed,i can dig it
nba,not_removed,i didnt even know how excited i was for old anthony davis with a grey unibrow hopefully handing out awards and stuff
nba,not_removed,im aware why not both kg was kg the kid and the big ticket for example
nba,not_removed,cant corral the brow
nba,not_removed,i feel like is more important than attempts in this case
nba,not_removed,pace adjust or gtfo
nba,not_removed,if you watch the tape most of the open are because jabari is clueless on d
nba,not_removed,source
nba,not_removed,its interesting that corner threes attempted doesnt really seem to have a correlation with how good at shooting a team is its all over the place
nba,not_removed,we give up so many wide open looks in our scheme pretty lame if you ask me
nba,not_removed,coach k gasol goat
nba,not_removed,gasol better
nba,not_removed,surprisingly this song is actually a good song for highlights
nba,not_removed,did the dream team sing a vanessa carlton song on a plane these guys are soft wed beat them by barkley
nba,not_removed,i did not expect the highlights to be there but the song just worked and it is amazing barnes pointing when it said if i could just see you is perfect
nba,not_removed,melo sittin there thinking i cant believe i signed up for this shit
nba,not_removed,derozan really likes the looks of his face
nba,not_removed,i cri
nba,not_removed,this video isnt available any mirrors pleasure
nba,not_removed,melo looks like the grumpy dad because he is noticably older than everyone in the video hes and the next oldest are lowry and dj even though this might not have been the best team ever it seems like the most chill one
nba,not_removed,kd is the michelin man confirmed at
nba,not_removed,is it weird that i got kinda emotional after watching this
nba,not_removed,im being serious right now i bet kds going to have so much fun hanging out with dray steph and the whole warriors squad feels like such a different vibe than the thunder
nba,not_removed,at when draymond takes a snap of melo and is giggling like a little kid looking at it so good haha great work op
nba,not_removed,i knew someone was going to do this reddit strikes again
nba,not_removed,well this is phenomenal
nba,not_removed,thank you
nba,not_removed,man this video is so good almost perfect if you had included the bleacher report fixed video of the dunk it would have been flawless
nba,not_removed,i just watched this with headphones in public and i was still embarrassed even though it just looked like i was watching basketball highlights for anyone who saw
nba,not_removed,still the best remix of this song
nba,not_removed,i like the slick transition to phantom cam
nba,not_removed,idk why it says the video is not available
nba,not_removed,ive never actually heard this song in its entirety
nba,not_removed,will always associate this song with white chicks
nba,not_removed,the song is amazing and those drums on top of nba highlights are awesome
nba,not_removed,lowlights ubootum used it for cj miles
nba,not_removed,the contrast with melos grumpy face is too perfect
nba,not_removed,well im pretty sure the team would beat them by
nba,not_removed,they probably did bryan adams
nba,not_removed,my friend said that the slowmo shots from melo and durant were his proudest moments also wished he couldve found better highlights for the duh duh duh duh duh duh parts
nba,not_removed,httpimgurcomabfgvp
nba,not_removed,kobe woulda never let this shit happen
nba,not_removed,why shouldnt he
nba,not_removed,i thought it was strange too but thats what people do now i guess not a trend im particularly fond of now even taping other things going on around you is done like a selfie good thing i could look at derozans dinosaurlooking mug all day
nba,not_removed,evri tym
nba,not_removed,cause of the song its probably blocked ill have a streamable up in a second
nba,not_removed,i thought i was going to see terry crews
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,dream team would probably win but by though
nba,not_removed,he looks like a fucking reptilian
nba,not_removed,im fine with the way boogie and dray did it but demars was like some instagram model shit
nba,not_removed,my man
nba,not_removed,sure those are scars from accutane poppovich has them too
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,hey what device were you using when the video wasnt working just curious
nba,not_removed,accutane doesnt cause scars acne does
nba,not_removed,i thought it was a side effect of accutane gets rid of acne but leaves those divets
nba,not_removed,if you have acne bad enough that you need accutane the acne is gonna be bad enough to leave scars looks no different from someone that just has acne scars
nba,not_removed,you learn something new everyday
nba,not_removed,clearly a foul from another angle
nba,not_removed,i admire how much you didnt give a fuck with the title
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,yea the replay showed pretty much ball
nba,not_removed,i thought it was elite
nba,not_removed,pj fleck is on reddit
nba,not_removed,za
nba,not_removed,oxford maine build an arena right next to the casino itll be fuckin mint bub
nba,not_removed,kentucky that state is all about ball and they deserve a franchise
nba,not_removed,d league champs get bumped up to nba the following year
nba,not_removed,as a cincinnati resident pls nba lets bring the royals back
nba,not_removed,right a wrong and expand in seattle if seattle gets another team i hope its through expansion dont want to just take anoter city and fan bases team it sucks trust me
nba,not_removed,the obvious seattle wa las vegas nv vancouver bc the interesting kansas city ks and mo louisville ky pittsburgh pa the unlikely honolulu hi anchorage ak san juan pr
nba,not_removed,pittsburgh has a really strong following for all its team but no nba team
nba,not_removed,vancouver and seattle a rivalry would be born right there
nba,not_removed,i think philly deserves a professional team
nba,not_removed,las vegas
nba,not_removed,kansas city would be a great place for a team and heres why we have the stadium already i watch whatever nba games they bring to the sprint center and it seems like it would be a great home for a team kansas really likes basketball as does missouri to an extent i live there and im tired of seeing all the warriors bandwagoners
nba,not_removed,to whoever is going around and downvoting all the seattle suggestions richard sherman sends his regards well see you in the fall
nba,not_removed,seattle or montreal
nba,not_removed,if they expanded and didnt put a team back in seattle they would really be on their sawgdy
nba,not_removed,bring back the hartford whalers as a basketball team
nba,not_removed,seattle
nba,not_removed,flint they need some good news
nba,not_removed,vancouver cause i live there
nba,not_removed,bring the nba back to seattle
nba,not_removed,london an nba team in london would be huge
nba,not_removed,kansas city similar to okca perceived football state would really bet behind an nba franchise
nba,not_removed,vancouver seattle because cascadia has the best rivalries in mls and i want that in the nba
nba,not_removed,las vegas seattle kansas city san diego baltimore pittsburgh louisville
nba,not_removed,maldives
nba,not_removed,seattle would be a lock contenders st louis they lost the rams and the nfl is done expanding san juan good pop distance isnt bad montreal they can probably support a nba team vancouver it would be cool to have teams in seattle vancouver portland louisville basketball town
nba,not_removed,tampa since the only major professional sports league that is missing is the nba and its proximity to orlando would make for an interesting rivalry against the magic
nba,not_removed,add teams in seattle and vancouver move memphis or nola to the eastern conference seattle and vancouver are huge media markets that have proven they can get behind a team memphisnew orleans is so far east already that it would probably be easier on them travel wise to play in the east we all know the chinese love basketball vancouver will soon be little beijing seattle should be much further along in the process of getting a new team but the city council are a bunch of fucks who lie in their campaign promises and then spend their tenure in office trying to figure out how to move homeless people aroundget a giant drill working again
nba,not_removed,las vegas because i live in las vegas and want a las vegas team to root for when the jazz dont have games
nba,not_removed,birmingham al has a big enough tv market to be reasonable has demonstrated interest in the nba and could pull together funding for an arena reasonably obviously seattle comes first but teams isnt happening so you need somewhere to pair with it and birmingham works well
nba,not_removed,lincon or omaha nebraska give us something to cheer for once football season ends
nba,not_removed,seattle
nba,not_removed,seattle supersonics
nba,not_removed,i know san diego has had tries before with the clippers and the rockets but its a different city now than it was then sdsu has turned this city into a basketball town and a team would probably be so popular among residents
nba,not_removed,team in chicago
nba,not_removed,little rock ar because i live near there
nba,not_removed,i wouldnt expanding makes no sense at this point
nba,not_removed,austin texas its the largest city in the us and currently has no professional sports team
nba,not_removed,i was gonna say bangor me next to hollywood casino the cic has a large paul bunyan statue could be the bangor lumberjacks
nba,not_removed,just learned now that hubie brown who coached the bullets and the pistons to championships coached the kentucky colonels edit my bad he was coach of the year in and
nba,not_removed,people really overestimate d league teams and underestimate any team in the nba the sixer would legitimately go undefeated in the dleague and the d league team would probably never win a game
nba,not_removed,do they get a chance to stay how do they defend their title if they make a trade and get relegated does the nba player they traded for have to go to the d league
nba,not_removed,thats cool but santa cruz warriors vs golden state warriors also how would a team be able to develop their players if they dont have their dleague affiliate would they have an expanded roster
nba,not_removed,and somehow the sixers will still get the first pick in the nba draft
nba,not_removed,would you take the thunder
nba,not_removed,as much as i love my native puerto rico theres no way in hell there should be an nba team there the economy isnt doing too well there if you havent heard
nba,not_removed,anchorage would definitely overcome detroit for the least attractive city for a millionaire athlete to want to live in
nba,not_removed,mostly because all their teams are usually good
nba,not_removed,pennsylvania is not a big enough market to command the need for any more than one nba team
nba,not_removed,the english dont play no basketball dude id vote for barcelona
nba,not_removed,it wouldnt make sense logistically traveling time would be insane unless nba becomes iba or something
nba,not_removed,its miles from san juan to portland i know that would be their furthest opponent but it seems excessive
nba,not_removed,la should give st louis the clippers as compensation for the rams
nba,not_removed,i like san juan how about mexico city
nba,not_removed,im not going to reference the latter part but vancouver proved that they couldnt get behind a team seattle is another story of course
nba,not_removed,california doesnt need another team
nba,not_removed,oh god no
nba,not_removed,san antonio is like hrs away houston like dallas like no way they would add another team there austin has the longhorns
nba,not_removed,well call them the austin rivers
nba,not_removed,also the traffic is already a bitch i couldnt imagine if they added a pro team
nba,not_removed,two arenas two teams the lumberjacks and the heroin addicts
nba,not_removed,and the train conventions
nba,not_removed,larry brown coached the pistons
nba,not_removed,every d league team would have max cap space coming into the nba
nba,not_removed,lowest team in the nba gets the boot d league contracts become player options
nba,not_removed,guess you should have called up who you wanted before they got in the nba part of the fun if a good teams sends too many people to the d league
nba,not_removed,you mean the cavs
nba,not_removed,well the pelicans basically started a dleague team at the end of the season because everyone was injured
nba,not_removed,fucking wet dream for sonic fans
nba,not_removed,is detroit worse than oklahoma city
nba,not_removed,flyerspenguins eaglessteelers and philliespirates id say that pennsylvania is viewed as a big enough market to have multiple teams in each sport off the top of my head only three states have multiple teams in all four of the major american pro sports florida new york and california only two states are one team short from being included in that stat texas nhl and pennsylvania nba i could be missing some but off the top of my head those two stats are one team away from having two teams in four different sports
nba,not_removed,london is nearly times the size of barcelona though
nba,not_removed,thats the tough part but it would be a massive success an nba team in london would be the richest most succesful franchise in the league and the new tv deals in britain and the commonwealth would bring in huge money
nba,not_removed,idk the population size is amazing but i dont know if players would want to live there edit plus its pretty far south in mexico
nba,not_removed,the league basically set up vancouver for failure they had the expansion draft rules that orlando and the others never had they had the worst gm in stu jackson who pulled off trades worse than billy king and was then rewarded with a exec league job and the exchange rate was always a problem especially since they had an owner that wasnt quite rich enough without stu jackson the team would still be there
nba,not_removed,if were going off of population i dont see why not california has more people than all of canada san diego is one of the most populated cities in the country and recently became a big college basketball town it wouldnt be entirely illogical
nba,not_removed,i would probably say the same thing if i didnt live here fuck arkansas
nba,not_removed,and seattle is hours away from portland sacramento oakland and la are all within hours the argument that they wouldnt put another team in texas because they have already is laughable if im the nba and choosing expansion cities im not choosing cities based on if they have teams in a certain driving distance its all about markets and austin is not only a large enough market to easily support a team but is growing as fast if not faster than any other market in the us
nba,not_removed,the bangor browns
nba,not_removed,just reread the wiki article he was coty those two years my bad
nba,not_removed,still doesnt help the fact that there will be a real nba team in the dleague who would just crush everyone
nba,not_removed,lowest team gets the boot ╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
nba,not_removed,definitely worse than detroit i go to utah every year to ski and that is all that there is to do there considering nba players cannot ski per their contracts it must suck to live there
nba,not_removed,barcelona actually cares about basketball though
nba,not_removed,an nba team in london would be the richest most succesful franchise in the league wot
nba,not_removed,brooklyn is another example i think the move from new jersey was considered a franchise relocation the nba nor the knicks objected
nba,not_removed,see above where all contracts become player options
nba,not_removed,say a barcelona resident is times more likely to be a basketball fan than a london resident since london is times bigger you have the same number of fans but london has many more possible corporate sponsors but arguing london or barcelona is silly realistically it would be better for the nba to have multiple teams in europe so london and barcelona with maybe paris and amsterdam rome milan or munich added in
nba,not_removed,london is nearly as big as ny and the team would have the tv market to itself instead of sharing with other teams like the ny and la teams do the games would be broadcast nationwide in britain to million people why do you think the nba and nfl have been so tempted by the possibility of a london franchise the logistics are nearly impossible but if they figure it out the money is huge
nba,not_removed,so if a team becomes last in the league they lose all the players they recently drafted every time a team gets relegated or moved up they become an entirely different team not to mention rookie contracts
nba,not_removed,hell in that situation if im the first pick im going to tank my team the first year to get out of my shitty contract and pick which team i go to
nba,not_removed,well if that happens we need a revival of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiconcorde
nba,not_removed,but nobody watches basketball in england by numbers alone it still wouldnt be the richest or most successful thats still the lakers all of socal minus the clipper fans and the neighbouring states are laker fans and the lakers are the most popular team in basically every non west coast state its like saying a london nfl team would be more popular than the cowboys patriots probably a better example in this era or the yankees it sounds nice but its not true the closest example to that is something like the blue jays in canada except canada has played baseball for over a century england has never played basketball spain would be a better place to put a european team
nba,not_removed,no one watches basketball in england because they dont have good teams to watch an nba franchise changes that i dont think you realize just how culturally relevant london is across the globe top gear had a global audience of million viewers in territories anything broadcast in the london tv market will be rebroadcast in australia malaysia china india the caribbean pretty much everywhere london is the best tv market in the world and you dont have to own the market just be present
nba,not_removed,except the games would be at like over there
nba,not_removed,the home games would be in the evening and they would be in the afternoon in the us away games would be in the evening if they were day games otherwise they would be in the middle of the night like youve said one of the many logistical difficulties of expanding a league across so many time zones one that has not proved impossible for though
nba,not_removed,not even top
nba,not_removed,its definitely not kobe bro
nba,not_removed,its not kobe its jordan
nba,not_removed,other than everything kobe did jordan did first better and more
nba,not_removed,kobe had the goat final performance its just the games before that werent as great as some other people you might know
nba,not_removed,jordan was on a whole different level
nba,not_removed,michael jordan
nba,not_removed,jordan was offensively dominant defensively dominant athletically dominant had the mentality drive and the perfect team to become the goat he put up a game in his second year
nba,not_removed,any laker fan under the age of will tell you its kobe any other person will give you a different answer in my opinion its mj but kobe is in my top
nba,not_removed,lol dude best player ever is not restricted to players you personally watched play the game
nba,not_removed,its jordan and it isnt close
nba,not_removed,mj thread
nba,not_removed,danny green
nba,not_removed,wilt
nba,not_removed,my heart tells me kobe but id say lebron is the best ive ever seen but its hard to argue against mj
nba,not_removed,i have kobe number behind jordan kareem and wilt jordan kareem wilt kobe duncan shaq magic bird hakeem lebron thats my top edit lol downvotes for my opinion haha figures around here
nba,not_removed,op literally everything you said can be said about jordan and he did it first youre the worst troll ive ever seen on here
nba,not_removed,the mole on mo speights head
nba,not_removed,mike beasley
nba,not_removed,kyle singlar
nba,not_removed,you could argue hes not a top laker edit magic and kareem clearly better shaq and wilt were better players but didnt have career with lakers dont know if thats important to some people so thats why i said you could argue it
nba,not_removed,not true jordan didnt set the record for most missed shots first
nba,not_removed,kobe is in your top over who i dont even think kobe is in the top edit downvotes for what mj kareem lebron magic wilt hakeem shaq duncan bird and russell all have arguments to be better than kobe
nba,not_removed,you cant fault him for it though hes taking a more logical approach to it than just looking at stats and youtube highlights from decades ago which dont tell nearly the whole story i find it refreshing instead of regurgitating stuff others say about players like wilt russell etc
nba,not_removed,dont agree with all of it but have an upvote just counter the irrational downvotes
nba,not_removed,good list
nba,not_removed,kareem and magic are better but i think kobe is greater than west baylor and shaq
nba,not_removed,no you couldnt lol try it
nba,not_removed,okay thats even more stupid than what op just said
nba,not_removed,youre an idiot
nba,not_removed,i was the first person to comment though
nba,not_removed,people overlook the simple fact that kobe spent yearsseasons in one single organization he did not get to pick his team unlike others lbj so he won rings with the same team something that cannot be said about other legends the only other player who comes close is magic johnson and rightly so i rate him higher as a player than kobe
nba,not_removed,best i could do kareem top player in a lot of peoples minds magic top in a lot of minds wilt ungodly stats that other greats couldnt even come near jerry west some people have argued hes the best guard in lakers history winning fmvp on a losing team and scoring almost ppg without a three point line and having a decent shot could have been lethal in any era if were feeling ballsy elgin baylor since he has been known as a revolutionary sf not saying i agree with every reason i listed but thats about as good as i could do
nba,not_removed,lol theres shaq kareem magic wilt id say kobe is the most recognizable laker and has the best legacy with the team id say kareem shaq magic kobe wilt cause i never even seen wilt so im not gonna pretend to have an opinion on him kobe is the laker goat tho
nba,not_removed,its easier to stick with one organization when you happen to have the most dominant center of all time as your teammate and the or one of the best coaches of all time lebron didnt have that and do you think durant would still be in oklahoma if they hadnt drafted westbrook and harden earlier no way
nba,not_removed,kobe also played on of the most stacked teams ive ever seen he was for sure a great and an amazing player who will forever go down in history but him being with la his whole career doesnt overtake the fact that players like kareem magic wilt bird russell lebron duncan hakeem shaq and maybe a few others all have legit cases as to why theyre better than kobe
nba,not_removed,wilt played seasons with the lakers and had very few of his great achievements with the club pau gasol is a greater laker than the big dipper its greatest laker not greatest player who played for the lakers
nba,not_removed,i agree that kobe is the goat laker
nba,not_removed,serious question why is this guy getting upvotes for saying that hes assuming has only been watching nba for the past years just because hes a warriors fan that is pretty disrespectful idk why rnba wants to condone this attitude
nba,not_removed,mj is the goat man sorry kobe aight tho
nba,not_removed,but you have a warriors flair so im assuming youve only been watching for the last two years and dont actually know why mj would be the goat lol alright bud
nba,not_removed,bad troll is bad
nba,not_removed,unless he took the qualifying offerwhich is dumb for a player of his calibre he would have had to stay in okc for or years so yes he would have stayed regardless of what okc was doing
nba,not_removed,you can only make that argument about kobes first championships shaq wasnt around thats of his years without shaq gasol and bynum can not even compare to shaq just because the gm made some smart transfer moves doesnt mean that kobe magically picked his team if you were watching around that time youd know how critical he was to their success and not the other way around
nba,not_removed,why do you use a stacked team argument then proceed to list a bunch of players who played with far more hall of famers than bean ever did
nba,not_removed,yeah i dont know why i thought wilt played so much longer than years with la
nba,not_removed,because its currently cool to shit on the warriors its fucking adorable to watch lakers fans on here try to play the innocent scrappy underdog card like they wont immediately turn around and act like insufferable little shitheads on here the moment they actually have a good year again
nba,not_removed,well im a warrior fan and some people dont personally like me on here its fine but thanks for trying
nba,not_removed,because playoffs bring the absolute worst of this sub out
nba,not_removed,mh you got a good point there let me change that in he definitely would leave okc now without a player like russell at his side
nba,not_removed,im not hating on kobe he is definitely one of the nbas greatest i just brought it up because i dont like it when people act like switching teams is the cowards way out chances are lebron still wouldnt have a title if he had stayed in cleveland and years with one team is long enough you can have a different debate when a player wins titles with a team and the second they dont make the playoffs he leaves
nba,not_removed,this exactly
nba,not_removed,youre right a lot of these players did play on more stacked teams than kobe but im not using rings as my argument my comment was referring to the fact that kobe played on very stacked rosters that helped him win his rings he didnt do it on his own rings are not the best way to compare players at this level you have to compare the players themselves directly for mj kareem lebron magic and wilt there is simply no argument that proves kobe was the better player if im rebuilding a team from scratch and i can have any player in history there is zero chance i take kobe before these guys for the others you can certainly make a case that kobe is better but i feel you can make an even stronger case that the other are more elite shaq and hakeem were simply dominant bigs who were unguardable i cannot justify putting kobe above either of these guys simply because of how dominant they were duncan is the best pf of all time and his dominance on both sides of the ball gives him the slight edge over kobe bird and russell well i honestly dont know as much about these players as the others but iirc bird was an absolute lights out shooter and was basically the kobe of the just better as for russell isnt he considered one of the most dominant defensive players to ever step on the court that type of is invaluable
nba,not_removed,its ironic when laker fans get on warrior fans for being bandwagon fans when everyone hated the lakers for the same exact reason not that long ago in cali
nba,not_removed,late when i was a kid
nba,not_removed,he probably will anyways
nba,not_removed,im not using rings as my argument though look at my response to the other guy
nba,not_removed,never said you were using rings as your argument but you used the stacked team argument to bring down kobes greatness for whatever reason there are only a couple top players who won without significant help hakeem in and timmy in that is about it if you explained your reasoning in all that i did not read for it was too long
nba,not_removed,i wouldnt be so sure about that both him and russell and the coach are to blame for not closing out the series the talent level in okc is still among the highest in the league and if he goes to another team it will usually take at least year until theyll compete for the title and they beat the spurs and now did almost the same to the warriors both of which are historically good teams
nba,not_removed,i didnt use it to bring down kobes greatness lmao i just said it wasnt a solid case for top all time
nba,not_removed,nah you literally used it as why you dont consider him up there
nba,not_removed,i just listed why i personally dont put him up there and you didnt bother to read it i didnt literally use it for my argument either
nba,not_removed,kobe also played on of the most stacked teams ive ever seen yes you did it was the very first thing you said
nba,not_removed,he won rings with the same team my response was to that comment it may have been the same organization but it was still the most stacked team in the league all years its not like he just carried scrubs to different rings for the lakers and didnt play around superstars again for the last time if you wanna know why i said kobe isnt top all time then read that long ass comment my argument has nothing to do with me saying kobe also played on of the most stacked teams ive ever seen so get over that part
nba,not_removed,defensive metrics arent really good for evaluating defense
nba,not_removed,rebounding and steals make his stats look good
nba,not_removed,he contested about shots this season dead last per minutes in the entire league for guards
nba,not_removed,i think his rebounds might be inflating his numbers a tad in these categories nevertheless westbrook is a great defender when he focuses on defense he just cant do that this season because he needs to expend so much effort offensively
nba,not_removed,as everyone has said those stats do place too much emphasis on steals rebounds and blocks he has a drpm of which seems closer to being accurate that number isnt actually terrible for a pg but not close to league leading or anything
nba,not_removed,a lot of those numbers have to do with the uncontested rebounds that his team boxes out for him to get and is also missing that he contests the fewest amount of shots of any player who plays over mins
nba,not_removed,this is just more evidence that defensive stats need to be refined
nba,not_removed,rebounds and steals will do that for ya
nba,not_removed,i read somewhere that hes last in contesting jumpers in the league he did a terrible job guarding steph on the perimeter hes not good at defense
nba,not_removed,classic case of stats not matching the eye test we all know westbrook can be really good but is extremely inconsistent defensicely and yet a good defensive team and bad metrics make him look great
nba,not_removed,thats actually impressive
nba,not_removed,rebounding and steals are a part of defense lol
nba,not_removed,lol i get rebounds but steals steals are supposed to make you look good
nba,not_removed,great feels like its pushing it hes a great athlete and when hes focused im sure his on ball defense is solid but the off ball stuff except for certain stretches looks like its as much effort as it is awareness
nba,not_removed,swear he says biyombo or at least i want to believe
nba,not_removed,i like kendrick as much as the next guy but this song really isnt anywhere near his best incredible video though
nba,not_removed,yes and getting free rebounds and gambling for steals doesnt make you a good defender the entire point of my post klay thompson terrible rebounder doesnt get steals way way better than westbrook on defense see the point
nba,not_removed,steals good defense westbrook gambles too much and leaves his man open going for steals
nba,not_removed,never said he was a good defender but just saying rebounding and steals are the reason his defensive stats are good doesnt make sense because no shit they would make his stats look better as they are part of defense on ball defense isnt everything
nba,not_removed,not so much this year a lot of the time the steals are just legit athleticism but the rebounding sometime has him out of place and just general lack of effort on d
nba,not_removed,it does make sense with the added context of how he gets those rebounds and steals it was probably assumed that everyone was aware of why he gets them
nba,not_removed,idk why youre down voted this is exactly what happens
nba,not_removed,id suck and fuck corey brewer every night for a year if it meant six straight for houston hes making million a year ill be his sugar baby driving free range rovers and wearing designer clothes every day

nba,not_removed,id fuck jokic to win titles and then tell about it
nba,not_removed,le spurs are too classy to ever repeat
nba,not_removed,he just didnt want to say boban

nba,not_removed,lol fair enough man
nba,not_removed,no way man youre my hero spreading the word even though people try to turn it into a joke jokic is legit one of the biggest draft surprises in recent times what a fantastic player
nba,not_removed,more evidence to you being utterly lost
nba,not_removed,hey i made another post for you be sure to cast your vote
nba,not_removed,ill pray for your parents
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,jonathon simmons made the spurs after paying for an open tryout
nba,not_removed,both dennis rodman and scottie pippen came to the nba from the naia not the ncaa however
nba,not_removed,i want to say ben wallace had an interesting path to the nba cant recall the story
nba,not_removed,rafer alston was a wellregarded streetballer before his nba career
nba,not_removed,does jeremy lin count he was undrafted but played years for harvard
nba,not_removed,he almost quit bball before his agent talked him into trying the open tryout hes got multiple kids like and he needed to make a stable living if he has as big of a role as i think he will this year mins a game more if manu gets injured or needs rest he could be in line for a big pay day hes athletic as almost anyone in the nba not named russ or lebron and has improved his outside shot if he can be more disciplined on d pop will play him a ton compared to last year just a quick run down for people not familiar with him athletic slasher really good passer and steadily improving outside shot that he didnt have enough confidence in last year weaknesses are bball iq tries to force his way to the rim too much on o and fouls too much on d and the aforementioned outside shot
nba,not_removed,he was an undrafted free agent from virginia union university an immeasurably tiny primarily black college very close to where i grew up its like how people say lillard came from a small school weber state weber state is a school with enrollment vuu has about student and is a school so basically it is the size of a high school
nba,not_removed,only alston was a round nba draft pick in
nba,not_removed,i used to love skip even though he was on the rockets
nba,not_removed,i can already see the pistons offering him years
nba,not_removed,him yao and tmac
nba,not_removed,hes not a big so i think we should be safe
nba,not_removed,adams did a pretty great job on them the first games honestly the way they were shooting the last games i dont think it mattered who was guarding them
nba,not_removed,i think this is a bit of a kneejerk reaction earlier in the series we were talking about how okcs length and athleticism was their advantage how good a job adams was doing on the perimeter and then he blocked currys the warriors countered and steph and klay made tough shots they lost but i think adams can definitely be a very valuable starter on a championship team
nba,not_removed,they only took him out because they needed a comeback their traditional c and length overall has gave us fits this series
nba,not_removed,no even a new age big like ibaka or ad cant guard curry on switches literally no one can
nba,not_removed,curry and klay are generation talents when it comes to shooting the basketball theres no shame in having to adapt adams wouldve been on the floor vs other teams
nba,not_removed,ultra small and if they had nate robinson too what would that lineup called ultra mega small
nba,not_removed,no centers that can score andor are dominant on the glass will always be a good counter to small ball see mosgov in last years finals hibbert against heat in whiteside or boogie against any team that plays small ball adams isnt as offensively gifted as some other big men so this put okc at a disadvantage because they couldnt utilize his size to score when gs went small
nba,not_removed,well even with smalls curry still can make its the other end even adams were very good at rebounding his offense not that great he couldnt punishpound them at other ends now days centres like townshorford that are settling midrange and
nba,not_removed,the small ball didnt work for at least games this series so lets not overreact and say the center is dead kat drummond adams cousins all of these guys are young not in their primes and defining the future of the center position
nba,not_removed,no there arent a lot of teams that can field small ball lineups with the skill that golden state has and its a unique problem to have adams on the best shooter of our generation the position is fine its just that the finals team dont rely on the traditional center adams is a beast though definitely the evolution of an ultraathletic big who can switch onto just about anyone
nba,not_removed,i dont think so klay and steph hit some really tough contested threes shots over adams other teams dont have guys hitting threes at that kind of rate on a regular basis and both klay and steph werent hitting them at this rate in the first games heck even playing bogut more minutes then usual helped gsw get their defense more under control big will never be out of style in this league and with guys like kat and ad playing major minutes at center the position will evolve
nba,not_removed,demise of the traditional no its simply a weak position as charles barkley said theres just not that many foot guys theres some guys theres some guys but real foot guys are rare when you finally find yourself a real foot guy that body is ideal for the center position but is he skilled enough earnie johnson chimes in with there has only been a few guys throughout history to really be skilled like a kareem or a shaq again this is true basketball requires a player to play offense and defense some guys do alright at one or the other only a couple ever put it all together then we get to the michael jordan gene first again the body can they jump can they time blocks can they steal the ball can they hustle dive and slam the ball over people then the mind can they make the right play can they hit the clutch ft can they pull out a new trick even when the pressure is on and the game is on the line at that point youre down to hakeem kareem bill russell wilt duncan ewing or shaq in our current generation of players nobody has it all theres a new class of dudes on their way up and maybe they will have it but nobody is a traditional in the way that the legends that have defined the position were
nba,not_removed,as good as he did you just cant stop curry and klay when they are on fire like tonight if anything they could go even smaller and have an unmatchable line up a line up of ian clark curry klay iguodala and barnes would be a match up nightmare for its speed and three point shooting
nba,not_removed,answer no a back court of curry and thompson is like having generational sharp shooters on the same side in the same era its just so unique i seriously doubt any other team can replicate that many years
nba,not_removed,ive said this before but steven adams isnt the unstoppable force people are making him out to be hes huge and physical but that mainly manifests itself in two ways hes an absolutely stellar offensive rebounder hes a great paint defender he started working a bit in the post on the offensive end this series but he lacks a lot of refinement there the warriors started to play bogut on him in the paint and it took away a lot of his ability to produce on the offensive end with the warriors small ball the expectation that they score in the paint diminishes as their objective is mainly to get guys open on the perimeter and suddenly adams defensive prowess isnt worth so much in the the thunder were down by or so with not too much time to go thats not the time to slow the game down and make extra passes to get your bigs open they needed that pace to increase to give them a chance of cutting the lead down in time adams is not part of that equation lastly a lot of teams starting emulating the spurs strategy that they used earlier in the season against the warriors in the game that had them totally blowing them out they switched essentially every time curry went through a screen meaning curry couldnt get to his open threes nearly as easily the warriors adjustment was to switch just enough to get a big like adams on him and then let curry do his thang on a guy like adams who has a very difficult time defending someone as quick as steph particularly at the three point line so yeah not the end of big man ball also steven adams is hes a great prospect and hes got a great personality but this sub acts like hes a top center in the league sometimes which is nowhere near reality
nba,not_removed,the quicker people realize that the type of basketball you like to see doesnt matter the easier viewing will be
nba,not_removed,well in todays nba were forced to switch the pick and roll due to how poorly screens are officiated if we could actually attempt to play through them or hedge without being but blasted into the ground there might be more counter play as officiating changes well see the game change and thats okay more over having a more efficient inside scorer will offset how bad the warriors can torch you when you have a big like towns shooting in the future and youre not able to body slam rubio into the ground youll notice a more versatile game
nba,not_removed,not every one is steph curry and will make the center look bad right away and make him pay this isnt a good example and the warriors still struggled to get a lot of rebounds it was just in the cards for the warriors tonight
nba,not_removed,its just hard to play a big c against the warriors the thunders defensive scheme involved heavy switching onto curry which is hard for adams but you basically have to do everything different against the warriors
nba,not_removed,maybe but in the end you see what happened they kept switching curry until adams on him they cleared out and let curry work him
nba,not_removed,the narrative keep changing whats next
nba,not_removed,i bet you wouldve seen more bogut if okc didnt use the hack a player strategy that strategy alone is killing a normal man basketball look just due to the fact centers statistically cant hit free throws
nba,not_removed,ive come to realize that you can play the best defense on curry and thompson and at the end of the day good shooters are going to shoot and make a good majority of their shots its just basketball weve just never seen shooters of quite this caliber before
nba,not_removed,the traditional has be on a heavy decline for a while now not a surprise that adams was used the way he was
nba,not_removed,curry hit a few threes in his face but to be honest i was happy not to see adams too much in the half the guy gives us fits im not sure it was a great idea to take him out completely
nba,not_removed,pretty much this when klay and curry shoot like that it just doesnt even matter
nba,not_removed,i mean it would because adams or bigs generally cant really crowd and throw off the motion at any competent level without getting a foul called or without falling out of a play if they get driven past what we saw in the last two games were shooters prepared to focus on their motion rather than be concerned about potentially being blocked
nba,not_removed,seriously donovan choosing not to play him does not equal him being unplayable
nba,not_removed,kevin hartkat williams for the picolineup
nba,not_removed,i think the lineup op was referring to was curry barbosa klay livingston barnes which might be as small as you should ever go
nba,not_removed,but it turned out playing mosgov wasnt a counter to small ball last finals we pulled bogut because he was getting beaten and forced small ball then mozzy become unviable for the cavs
nba,not_removed,heyheyheyyou forgot to include embiid in that list of yours
nba,not_removed,jv
nba,not_removed,i think towns can get there
nba,not_removed,except that lineup cant defend as well without dray
nba,not_removed,pete dinklage with the shot
nba,not_removed,which comes to coaching and better defense gsw designs those plays that switch adams onto the perimeter where hes weak this is a result of good coaching not an indication of the center position dying
nba,not_removed,i actually have a ton of faith in the upcoming class adams included theyre just all a ways away from their peak because of how much high school and college ball has changed i think centers are particularly behind to the point where theyre usually not that useful until or their peak is a bit later or so and then they can hang around a bit longer than a lot of guards and wings if their bodies dont break down the embiid towns noel wcs adams okafor gobert drummond jocic nurkic jv davis class seems pretty much on target to deliver a big man revival im definitely excited
nba,not_removed,dude this sub fucking hates the warriors and shit on their team and fans when they were down its the internet give me a break
nba,not_removed,this is why you dont go to other teams subs if you arent a fan of the team
nba,not_removed,cool
nba,not_removed,who gives a fuck about other fans man if you love ball just enjoy the game dont worry about the rest
nba,not_removed,cry about it
nba,not_removed,you act like it wouldve been different if okc won
nba,not_removed,what do you expect its their team and people have been shit talking them all series long they can do whatever they want
nba,not_removed,after we had been brigaded constantly this entire series why cant we say a big fuck you to the people who done it
nba,not_removed,after the shit rnba gave them for the draymond green incident and the deficit im fine with them gloating stop crying
nba,not_removed,lol this guy
nba,not_removed,we had a bunch of gsw fans watching at a local bar and i can tell you when it was over there was no cheering we took a moment to reflect on every team in the league there were no winners or losers tonight its all about fun winning is not the biggest deal just because on the scoreboard there were more numbers at the end for us in games does not mean we really won okc won more than us throughout the entire series and if there were points for heart and grit they deserve them also youre retarded
nba,not_removed,every teams sub has stuff like that its just fans being fans who cares this was the top post on the right sidebar earlier complete with shitting on an entire fanbase and conspiracy theories
nba,not_removed,do you happen to work for the salt lake city newspaper
nba,not_removed,stop whining man these people arent in your living room gloating if you like a team how their rnba fans behave shouldnt affect your stance on the team grow up man
nba,not_removed,we all we got we all we need its probably not fair to feel like everyone is against you because not everyone is but people perceive things how they perceive it it appeared the loudest people were constantly calling out the bandwagon throwing crap about how overrated we are how happy they would be to see us crybabies lose blah blah blah it puts people a fanbase in a cocoon where its us vs them its horrible its the internet
nba,not_removed,the warriors have some good level headed fans in this sub that actually engage in real talk and strategy regarding games unfortunately that kind of talk isnt upvote worthy cause it gets buried in memes in this sub as well as team subreddits for the guys that do the gloating its probably all they have i learn to just ignore it
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,yeah theyre like the weird kids in the corner try to avoid them
nba,not_removed,lol fuck the warriors for celebrating history i guess
nba,not_removed,he already is lol

nba,not_removed,mac wily
nba,not_removed,hell be medium kev
nba,not_removed,kyrie korver kd bron love thats a fun lineup
nba,not_removed,or kevin martin being kmart it was always kenyon martin to me
nba,not_removed,it bothers me so much when i see josh richardson being called jrich
nba,not_removed,or like lbj was actually what lebrons mother would give delonte west on latin nights
nba,not_removed,he means in the locker room he was probably addressed as dwill and thatll have to change now
nba,not_removed,regardless the announcers gave him that name from day at arizona obviously because of how similar his name is to derons though
nba,not_removed,thats the joke
nba,not_removed,how am i only noticing this now
nba,not_removed,holy shit i cant stop laughing
nba,not_removed,no they will just both say williams on the fox sports broadcast last night they mentioned the rules of early would mean theyd have to use first initial of first name on their jersey until they were different which would have resulted in dero williams and derr williams would have looked so bad lol
nba,not_removed,s curry
nba,not_removed,wade gave up being the flash
nba,not_removed,but he was never really dwill
nba,not_removed,lol are you saying jlo started it
nba,not_removed,this just needs to be higher up imagine ejo instead of magic pmav instead of pistol pete narch instead of tiny drob instead of the admiral
nba,not_removed,yes it is thats why its called a nickname theres no right or wrong way to call a nickname
nba,not_removed,you sound a bit bitter

nba,not_removed,people forgetting jr already
nba,not_removed,it was always the store i used to steal stuff from when i was a kid to me
nba,not_removed,or tracy mcgrady trying to be tmac when we all knew it was really todd macculloch
nba,not_removed,yea but at least that was a debatable on who was the real kmart
nba,not_removed,just like mj is never gonna be majic johnson
nba,not_removed,same just like when i hear people call some old fart larry legend when the nickname belongs to larry nance jr
nba,not_removed,wat
nba,not_removed,ehh it happens before i went to texas state university lbj stood for lebron but i pass by a lyndon b johnson statue everyday so now every time i hear lbj i think of him
nba,not_removed,sharing birthdays with teammates wasnt enough for deron
nba,not_removed,w the shot boi
nba,not_removed,thats ok i actually enjoy watching barry allen now
nba,not_removed,for the awesome nickname wow
nba,not_removed,you expect every mediocre player to have a quality nickname like nba legends
nba,not_removed,kaahhhnnnn
nba,not_removed,wonder why
nba,not_removed,httpimgurcomapxzzc
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,kevin like like
nba,not_removed,jr and korver are interchangeable depending on the level of pipeness youre feeling that day
nba,not_removed,i think korver is better
nba,not_removed,what would you steal most
nba,not_removed,just like how keyon dooling will always be the real kd thank goodness paul george changed his jersey number so he can adopt the moniker it was just disrespectful to the great pat garrity to call another player pg so carelessly
nba,not_removed,thats new jersey nets legend todd macculloch to you
nba,not_removed,or how about just the name larry nance jr completely ripped it off from his dad what a tool
nba,not_removed,i i respect you and all but jesus fucking christ i dont like you edit take your god damned upvote you animal
nba,not_removed,el bj
nba,not_removed,if you like cringe jokes ive built a youtube channel just for ya
nba,not_removed,nope but i think tmac should have gotten a better one kd sounds like air jordan when you think the alternative is slim reaper might be the syndrom in my time everything was better but i really can not think of a great nickname in last ten years very goodgreat player has or had well other than flash that is if you do not count sauce castillo as very good player
nba,not_removed,but why
nba,not_removed,link didnt open for me but if i were a betting man id say that was thrillho
nba,not_removed,these never ever get old
nba,not_removed,jr is more wet in than korver
nba,not_removed,o really
nba,not_removed,what if i just dont want the pipe that day
nba,not_removed,i used to steal the coins off of the puffles that had the code on it i didnt even play club penguin though lol
nba,not_removed,milf hearts
nba,not_removed,various pocket knivesi wasnt the most mentally stable grader in the world
nba,not_removed,or richard jefferson going by rj when that was clearly always ron jeremy
nba,not_removed,woah now lets not get carried away do we really know if larry nance jr even knew who the other larry nance was before he got the name
nba,not_removed,link please
nba,not_removed,mamba the truth big ticket big fundamental the jet superman the chosen one king father of
nba,not_removed,the truth the king the babyfaced assassin the greek freak black mamba the answer the beard the brow boogie cardiac kemba uncle drew porzingod the stifle tower splash bros stache bros jimmy g buckets the grindfather brodie and of course andrea primo bargnani
nba,not_removed,maybe if shaq didnt walk into camp all lazy and fat he would have been able to churn out some more nicknames
nba,not_removed,korver is underrated in
nba,not_removed,haha ever feel bad
nba,not_removed,lil devil noice
nba,not_removed,hope groaning is your thing httpswwwyoutubecomusermemetherapy
nba,not_removed,just gotta get him open
nba,not_removed,no i still do it
nba,not_removed,nah lol i probably should though
nba,not_removed,tasty
nba,not_removed,how your channel gave me a stroke
nba,not_removed,you arent me get outta here
nba,not_removed,gotta cash in before club penguin shuts down i respect the hustle
nba,not_removed,time to so bigger and better things until you feel bad might be your calling card
nba,not_removed,well it could be due to blood clot in one of your cerebral arteries
nba,not_removed,nah man im never ripping off another puffle code im fucking done with that shit now that i think about it i kinda feel bad for the kids who only got a puffle toy without getting the ingame stuff i dont feel bad for kmart so maybe i could rob a bank or something
nba,not_removed,haha there it is well done
nba,not_removed,i read the first half of that comment like you were a felon giving a speech to kids about staying on the right track it was all fun and games until i started stealing tokens
nba,not_removed,scared straight puffle nightmare
nba,not_removed,i swear this has to be the coolest group of friends in the nba
nba,not_removed,compile all of these yacht snaps into your original post and add them as edits next time imo
nba,not_removed,it must be nice to have friends
nba,not_removed,damn melo is missing out
nba,not_removed,it cant hurt that they can all just go wherever they want on any day they want by whatever transportation they want and have anything they want basically what im trying to say is that yacht looks straight up ballin
nba,not_removed,yeah and they all earned their way there these are not trust fund babies who all just have fun on their social media they deserve all this fun and taking a break
nba,not_removed,i was not criticizing them i was saying it lends to more interesting group outings and adventures
nba,not_removed,this man is amazing
nba,not_removed,joel reddit gold embiid
nba,not_removed,he does what he wants
nba,not_removed,what was the score
nba,not_removed,ended up in the final minute in the game
nba,not_removed,embiid is a clown
nba,not_removed,put them up lol
nba,not_removed,a clown with a smooth post game and nice shot
nba,not_removed,youre a clown my man
nba,not_removed,wow you just pissed me off im going to downvote you and call you a clown is your name ronald hahaha xdxd s
nba,not_removed,u wouldnt talk shit about him at lan
nba,not_removed,lol with seconds left did they lose
nba,not_removed,i get hes good at basketball im just saying hes goofy not sure why all the downvotes its hard to deny the guy is an entertainer guess if something can be percieved negative against him its going down lol
nba,not_removed,still playing joel has gone since
nba,not_removed,no theyre about to win and embiid went on fts in the last seconds
nba,not_removed,yeah i got what you were saying rnba can be sensitive sometimes when they think youre insulting the golden child
nba,not_removed,ah the weekly lets shit on rose thread
nba,not_removed,its not too late for him to reinvent himself people came back from worase
nba,not_removed,absolutely hell be the only mvp to never make the hall of fame
nba,not_removed,damn i forgot that rose is only and should only be entering his prime right now such a shame man
nba,not_removed,we got robbed of his career
nba,not_removed,for frame of reference i watched and httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjazzwxqivbq wow dude used to be soooo aggressive most of my exposure to roses play is post injury
nba,not_removed,yep whos
nba,not_removed,hell be the only one to not be in the hof so yes probably
nba,not_removed,😢
nba,not_removed,wellyeah probably sadly very sadly
nba,not_removed,worst is a pretty strong word im sure u didnt mean it in a volatile way but the fact he was mvp regardless of whether or not we feel he is last place among all who won it is nothing to be ashamed about just to be clear
nba,not_removed,and say derrick rose is the only mvp that will not make the hof despite nothing being confirmed yet
nba,not_removed,💩 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
nba,not_removed,worase perfect spelling mistake
nba,not_removed,he actually has reinvented a lot of his game he still plays similarly by attacking the basket as his main way to score but he jumps differently now instead of going up and landing awkwardly he jumps forward now so the landing wont hurt him anymore only reason no one has been saying hes reinvented himself is because hes been stuck on shitty teams and i cant think of anyone who came back from worse but i might be wrong
nba,not_removed,so he is the best player to ever win an mvp but miss the hof
nba,not_removed,i swear to god every shit on rose thread you are either the top comment or the op i have a red sitting next to your username lmao rose could still make the hall of fame i dont know why everyone is saying he wont basketball hof isnt hard to get into and roy mvp team allnba is probably more than enough
nba,not_removed,you cant say that as its a fact he wont get in lesser players with less accomplishments have gotten in
nba,not_removed,too early to say that maybe hell take up coaching
nba,not_removed,hopefully he goes to a team like the spurs and wins a ring or two with kawhi and lma and makes himself a case would hate to see the guy miss the hof after being so explosive
nba,not_removed,entering his prime entering im not even hating on you op but how does this have upvotes and nt a single reply about how is not the age that anyone enters their prime at except a very small number of exceptions its one thing if a random user singular makes a mistake or lacks knowledge its another thing if no one on this sub even recognizes the mistake or attempts to correct it
nba,not_removed,crazy how different it would have been if he hadnt torn his acl against philly
nba,not_removed,prime rose was very very similar to prime westbrook minus the rebounding
nba,not_removed,maybe wes unseld aside from the year he won he was never top in voting again only allstar appearances and never averaged points per game he does have a ring and a fmvp though
nba,not_removed,probably some dude in the or
nba,not_removed,probably bill walton also because of injuries
nba,not_removed,iverson achievement wise
nba,not_removed,as a bulls fan even i could say he arguably shouldnt have won mvp that year
nba,not_removed,yeah lebron isnt in the hall of fame either you never know
nba,not_removed,why would he make it
nba,not_removed,but also the worst
nba,not_removed,his bbiq is too low for the spurs
nba,not_removed,im sorry we didnt meet your expectations
nba,not_removed,you just did exactly what you are chastising others for how about you edit your post with the information you claim to have from what i understand he is not far off your prime as a player is right around thats when you still have the athletic ability but your bbiq has caught up physical prime is a much younger age but thats not what he said
nba,not_removed,and plus the gang rape bring out the downvotes
nba,not_removed,dave cowens too these guys were before my time so i cant really say just going by statsaccomplishments here
nba,not_removed,do those decades even count
nba,not_removed,winners in the were pettit cousy russell might be kd at the moment
nba,not_removed,and he still led a team to a title and won another one down the road id argue ais career doesnt match up to waltons even with the horrific injuries
nba,not_removed,uwhythehellknot is a knicks fan and let me tell you something about us knicks fans our basketball team sucks and rose is a huge part of the problem when i people shit on rose its like a breath of fresh air
nba,not_removed,youngest mvp significant feat making history leading his team to conference titles and best record in the nba all star all nba roy gold medalsplus career is hardly over despite the idiotic he should play in china nonsense people love to pretend that you need to be freaking curry or lebron to get into the basketball hofyou dontand derrick was and is huge internationally and has set a major record by being the youngest mvpwhat do people think hofs are they are made to acknowledge and immortalize exactly these things edit mentioned conference titles by mistake was just thinking about them being at the top of the east straight years and associated that with conference titles by mistake
nba,not_removed,are you the same animal but still a different beast
nba,not_removed,i think youre underestimating pop
nba,not_removed,thank you admittance is the first one toward correctence
nba,not_removed,im sure these guys were before of this subs time comparing cowens to unseld though cowens has more allstar allnba and alldefense selections more rings and much higher career box score stats id say at least on paper unseld had the worse career
nba,not_removed,after looking it up was the first year of the mvp award so no the and early dont count
nba,not_removed,are we pretending kd retires tomorrow or something because once his career is all said and done i can definitely see him as a top player all time putting him under guys who played in the or unseld is borderline insulting even right now
nba,not_removed,in terms of career accomplishments its probably kd thats obviously going to change though
nba,not_removed,he led his team to a conference title series radically different than saying he led them to conference titles not only did he not win any conference titles he only went to the ecf once
nba,not_removed,lol i love that commercial
nba,not_removed,what the fk does that mean
nba,not_removed,whats pop going to do tell rose to start standing under shooters and reinvent himself as bruce bowen
nba,not_removed,i think he meant at the peak of his prime
nba,not_removed,yea i was meaning at this point his career resumè will undoubtedly improve
nba,not_removed,yeah my mistake i was just thinking about them having the best record twice and somehow associated that with the conference titles
nba,not_removed,tmac just made it in without ever sniffing a conference final in series where he actually played meaningful minutes
nba,not_removed,kd would still make it to the hall of fame even if he retired today though all star allnba first team scoring champion with points
nba,not_removed,id feel comfortable slotting him in front of iverson
nba,not_removed,even at this point he has great accolades only players with more scoring titles are mj and wilt
nba,not_removed,i guess regular season titles counts for something i didnt think of that either
nba,not_removed,that dude went way too hard to defend that lol
nba,not_removed,i love jamal so much such an entertaining player to watch good or bad
nba,not_removed,hes a lot better in seattle than la
nba,not_removed,honestly the draft is going to be so good ik cuban doesnt like tanking but they should
nba,not_removed,nice im sure everyone else will believe this
nba,not_removed,they need to just seriously tank and rebuild around hb
nba,not_removed,of the playoff spots are locked no question gsw spurs clippers okc grizzlies rockets and jazz dont get it and the last spot is in a war between the kings nuggets and blazers and even potentially the the pelicans ill bet anything they wont make it get a good draft pick and have someone to build around after dirk retires and have a good new player to give dirk a good last playoff run
nba,not_removed,honestlyare we playing basketball or ping pong
nba,not_removed,just keep telling yourself that man
nba,not_removed,play not very well for markelle amiright mavs fans
nba,not_removed,bro just accept it
nba,not_removed,soooo that means lakers also have a chance lmao
nba,not_removed,the tank commander
nba,not_removed,fuck
nba,not_removed,the entire fanbase wants it for the most part give the fans what they want
nba,not_removed,nobody in this draft is as good of a prospect as simmonskatembiid were in past years
nba,not_removed,i believe it i dont think that rick wants to tank he looks at the records of the teams fighting for the seed and sees hes only losses back
nba,not_removed,harrison wont ever be the centerpiece for a championship team hes a good player but we need a superstar player to build around
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,a master tank commander never admits to a tank
nba,not_removed,i dunno bro nobody in this draft is as good as simmonskatembiid why even waste your time s
nba,not_removed,whats your point the value of this draft is its depth its deeper than previous ones not having a singular prospect who looked as good as those dudes is irrelevant and doesnt negate the depth of this draft its not really even debatable
nba,not_removed,do they really think they can beat the warriors tho can they win even one game
nba,not_removed,yeah i kinda feel hes a good player but not really a first option maybe second if you want to be a contender because if he was really that good the team would have way more wins now because he would have dragged them to some wins
nba,not_removed,whats funny
nba,not_removed,hes and averaging and and hes efficient
nba,not_removed,for some reason you dont understand the argument being made about draft depth vs top prospects and their different impact on a teams incentives to tank imagine two scenarios you and twenty nine friends went to a party last year with full knowledge beforehand of party gifts the first three guests each received a ferrari the next twenty seven received a roll of toilet paper you and twenty nine friends are going to a party tonight the first ten guests each receive a playstation four with two games the next receive a with no games the next fifteen receive a sixty dollar gift card to gamestop in which scenario are you most likely to leave early if you have a friend who was unwilling to leave early last year why would he be eager to leave early tonight
nba,not_removed,its not irrelevant if they didnt tank in order to get a potential superstar the last few years theres no way in hell theyre tanking for this draft so yes in a sense youre right its not debatable
nba,not_removed,no
nba,not_removed,by that logic would boogie before this season not be considered someone to build around
nba,not_removed,bro sarcasm
nba,not_removed,so despite all scouts and draft experts calling it the deepest draft in years youre telling me that the mavs think the experts are wrong solely because some dude on reddit isnt buying it once again there are more potentially franchise changing guys in this draft than there have been in previous ones the top guys look like they can be the best or second best players on a franchise that wasnt the case in previous drafts and its not up for debate its a fact not having a singular player that looks as good as the players you named doesnt negate that
nba,not_removed,why do you think there are no potential superstars in this draft thats just false
nba,not_removed,and i guess ad couldnt be the centerpiece of a team either
nba,not_removed,yeah i understand that his comment would be closer to correct if it wasnt sarcastic
nba,not_removed,maybe you should read more closely
nba,not_removed,so despite all scouts and draft experts calling it the deepest draft in years youre telling me that the mavs think the experts are wrong solely because some dude on reddit isnt buying it literally never said that
nba,not_removed,its full of pgs that cant shoot wings that cant dribble josh jackson and a pf thats torn his acl like in high school alone it has a lot of good prospects and some all star caliber ones but nobody that screams franchise player like kat or embiid
nba,not_removed,you said they wouldnt tank for the guys you named so they wouldnt tank for anyone in this draft solely because no one player is as good as the guys you listed as though that negates the depth in this draft
nba,not_removed,youre telling me fultz and ball cant shoot
nba,not_removed,embiid didnt really play in college his full potential screamed franchise but nobody knew for sure fultz is more of a sure thing than joel
nba,not_removed,the point hes making is you are more likely to tank to get a guy like kat with the first or second pick if anything this upcoming drafts depth removes the incentive to tank
nba,not_removed,or dennis smith its just ntilikina and fox who are not good shooters lmao
nba,not_removed,im aware and dont think its a valid point you dont wait for guys like kat to tank because a you dont know when those guys are coming and its no guarantee that theyre going to be franchise guys even if you do b when you have a perfectly good opportunity in a deep draft theres no reason to prolong rebuilding for a guy who may or may not be there in future drafts
nba,not_removed,even ntilikina can hit shots at a reasonable rate its pretty much only fox who has a weak jump shot
nba,not_removed,this doesnt make sense if there are two top prospects in a shallow upcoming draft your incentive to tank is greater than if the draft is deep but lacking a lebron or even a kat caliber player this conversation is independent of whether in fact any given team ought to tank the point is that depth isnt doing in your argument what you think it is
nba,not_removed,me too
nba,not_removed,isnt being on the cover of enough for him
nba,not_removed,consistency is key achieve that and you very well have a good chance
nba,not_removed,doesnt every nba player
nba,not_removed,then become consistent
nba,not_removed,if he and the pacers can step up and be consistent he has a chance
nba,not_removed,please be that this coming season
nba,not_removed,i really think hes at that level but the one guy its hard for me to see how hed end up ahead of is kawhi its very likely the spurs will be better than the pacers and kawhi will be the clear best player on the spurs the way mvps tend to go unless pg just plays way better than kawhi kawhi would get it
nba,not_removed,come on son lets be real here pg is not an nba regular season mvp caliber player yet excellent player but not top in the game sorry pacer fans i wont knock him for his fg even tho its clear he needs a more consistent jumper to be a truly great offensive player but if the argument is bad teammates mean tougher shots and shittier then he should also be scoring more than low
nba,not_removed,paul george ball cop
nba,not_removed,its great he has this goal all power to him i hope he can get to that level
nba,not_removed,i think he has a shot lets see what happens
nba,not_removed,no doubt he has the talent but unfortunately i dont see the pacers being a top seed well see i suppose
nba,not_removed,if his shooting is more consistent and the team has success it could happen otherwise hed really need to improve his handle or add something new like a high post game or some skills as a screener
nba,not_removed,lets get it pg
nba,not_removed,i cant wait for a lebronless league
nba,not_removed,go do the damn thing you have the ability for sure one of the nicest dudes i know with the help he got he should be able to be up there
nba,not_removed,i think he has a chance
nba,not_removed,if he had a true second option this could happen its just carrying the team alone causes his fg to go up and down at times in the season as he gets tired
nba,not_removed,i think pg has zero chances of winning mvp for one its easier to win mvp by dominating on offense vs dominating on defense like pg does so he simply wont get as much attention compared to harden curry lebron westbrook as theyre just better on that end two hell need his team to win significantly more games in order to even put himself in the picture and i dont see the pacers doing that
nba,not_removed,hes going to have to average a few more points and the pacers are going to have to win a few more games not sure if a new coach and more talented but fresh roster are detriments or improvements but it will be fun to watch i really like pg and think he can improve quite a bit
nba,not_removed,reminds me when d rose said and he went out there and got it played perfectly to the narrative
nba,not_removed,thats too bad cause youre not gonna be an mvp pg you know that right lad you arent gonna get it so try getting another goal that is more reasonable like giving your dog a walk every day consecutively for the next month or something i did that and it made me feel really good about myself it might not be an mvp but it makes me happy and thats all that really matter cause we are all the mvp of our own lives
nba,not_removed,win more games then league isnt awarding mvp to guys on teams that win games i think the fewest wins recently was nashs suns with one season
nba,not_removed,tehre is no i in mvp mr george
nba,not_removed,never gonna happen sorry pg
nba,not_removed,pg has become my favorite player with steph shriveling up in the finals durant showing that hes an utter bitch lebron still being the cornball hes always been westbrook still having a negative iq harden still having the most cringeworthy game still flopping paul george the only real nigga left and i commend him for his confidence going into this season
nba,not_removed,thats good because hes going to be the mvp it would be awkward if when they give him the trophy and hes all i dont want it
nba,not_removed,george is good enough to be an mvp this year especially theres no competition besides maybe westbrook and lillard maybe lebron but i think theyll start limiting his minutes i really cant imagine durant and curry being mvp candidates when they play on the same team with multiple other amazing players its slim competition this year make sure the pacers are great and george is an easy mvp candidate
nba,not_removed,same here
nba,not_removed,its nice to want things
nba,not_removed,your mvp
nba,not_removed,not while its a popularity contest
nba,not_removed,i want to date shakira
nba,not_removed,people are shifting their goals from winning the championship now
nba,not_removed,who is the better player overall or james harden who do you guys think has a better shot at that mvp title
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i wonder if they are trying to create a narrative for him to be mvp
nba,not_removed,why is he even on the cover trying to hype up his season
nba,not_removed,being on a top team is a big deal
nba,not_removed,what does consistent mean derrick rose
nba,not_removed,didnt get to watch too much of pacers last year other than the playoffs where pg looked like a monster could someone elaborate on his inconsistency
nba,not_removed,kawhi will be the clear best player on the spurs not sure i agree with that as long as lma is lacing them up
nba,not_removed,people with dogs dont walk them every day i have to take my dog on two or three walks a day and have never thought much of it
nba,not_removed,try getting another goal that is more reasonable like giving your dog a walk every day consecutively for the next month or something pg has never pulled off something with that kind of consistency
nba,not_removed,idk if hell be able to do that hes pretty inconsistent
nba,not_removed,kawhi
nba,not_removed,this is a true rnbacirclejerk post
nba,not_removed,kawhi is a big front runner for mvp too
nba,not_removed,i agree about durant and curry same with lebron he will be resting for the playoffs but to be mvp you need to be on a top team just look over the mvps of the last years they are all on top teams preferably top teams i think thats what will hinder pg he will have a great season on a slightly above team same goes with lillard and westbrook they could have a great season on win teams i think kyrie irving is a good dark horse candidate for mvp because the cavs will have wins in the mid to high and kyrie is young enough to still be growing and have an even better season than last year kawhi is another candidate but pops system in recent years has not lend itself to be beneficial to get mvps though its great for team success because of the unselfishness of the players but since the spurs are a little on the thin side with regards to depth compared to recent years this might be the year kawhi needs to go full superstar and carry the offense
nba,not_removed,i think is the dark horse of the race
nba,not_removed,either all you guys are high on pg or the value of mvp has gone down
nba,not_removed,make sure the pacers are great the problem is that the pacers and george have to really really great in order to get the media hype required for him to get mvp personally i think its gonna be lebronhe wants that mvp and this year might be best opportunity with his main rivals cancelling each other out or they are going to do some weird comvp with gswtheres precedent remember that dumb hawks thing that they did
nba,not_removed,i agree especially out east since they havent been close to top seed in a while that works in pgs favor
nba,not_removed,no
nba,not_removed,this is tough because harden is so much better offensively but george is a much better defender
nba,not_removed,harden is much better offensively than that it makes this a rather comfortable choice george is criminally reliant on his outside shooting if his threes are dropping he can have an explosive scoring game but usually it regresses to the mean sooner or later and his other skills on offense while decent arent good enough harden is an alltime great scorer how many dudes in nba history averaged ppg on over a course of seasons his drive and kick game is elite solid playmakerpasser outside of that too his turnovers are a problem his defense is a problem but hes not as horrible as people make it sound and he has a proclivity to ballstop hold the ball for long stretches and run the clock down in favor of isolation but if your team is absolute garbage on offense which the rockets were in these last few seasons then thats probably your best bet to at least have a competitive offense
nba,not_removed,i think its more likely that a supercharged dantoni offense can launch rockets above their expected win total than for a nate mcmillan pacers to be better than expected since wins are so heavily weighted in mvp considerations i give the edge to harden i dont think either guy can really be the best player on a championship team but hardens insane shotcreation and weak defense is probably still more valuable than pgs good offense and elite defense
nba,not_removed,gonna have to go with because he doesnt play negative defense
nba,not_removed,is this a joke harden is a top five player best at his position all time great offensively pg isnt even in the top at his position and is just good offensively and great defensively
nba,not_removed,are they not allowed to have variation in their cover athletes who is supposed to be on it lol
nba,not_removed,well technically he still has room to improve hes a great allaround player but doesnt do anything at a particularly elite level if he adds something other than shooting threes hoping they go in to his scoring arsenal if he becomes more efficient if he can maybe improve his playmaking if he gives more effort consistently defensively lets just say if he plays even remotely as good as he did vs the raptors in the playoffs which i doubt he will but ok hypothetically i dont know if thatd make him the best player in the league but hed definitely have a a solid case for top maybe that in combination with the help of teague having a good year myles turner improving jefferson brooks bolstering the bench they can win around games which could put him in contention for mvp depends on how kawhi does because the warriors will share the wealth lebron are coasting every other candidates team probably wont win games
nba,not_removed,he was pretty much the best player on the best team for the first half of before the pacers capitulated
nba,not_removed,if you watch pacer games then you can see how its possible for him to achieve that
nba,not_removed,jeff green
nba,not_removed,we men
nba,not_removed,it means
nba,not_removed,i dont know but maybe you could tell me
nba,not_removed,just look up his stats from month to month from game to game etc just look up his stats in general
nba,not_removed,lol lma is good a top for sure but kawhi is inarguably better
nba,not_removed,depends on the breed i guess
nba,not_removed,plenty of dog owners who dont even let their pupperinos leave the house poor babies
nba,not_removed,theres some days when i just dont feel like going out to walk my dogs for an hour i do try to walk them everyday tho
nba,not_removed,if giving your dog a walk everyday is a goal then you probably shouldnt have a pet
nba,not_removed,i like kawhi but he doesnt have any swagger
nba,not_removed,i guess because rnba and reddit in general is about adhering to a script for upvotes
nba,not_removed,harden is in that race as well lets be honest enough to admit that mvp is by and large the offensive player of the year award
nba,not_removed,kyrie is under no circumstances winning the mvp even if lebrons limited to minutes per game or something crazy like that
nba,not_removed,we got a first seed years ago
nba,not_removed,yes checkmate atheists
nba,not_removed,its also tough because pg doesnt play a style of d that consistently shines every game his team isnt good enough defensively i mean theyre starting teague ellis and young for george to play a free safety balldenial and passing lane interceptor like kawhi he cant anchor the d and constantly switch or rim protect like draymond hes not the paint presence of gobert or deandre jordan he really excels when the opposing team has an excellent offensive wing like lebron or kd and pg can stifle and hound him on and offball on the other hand hardens offensive style is so versatile and he runs the offense no matter what you can tell hes going to showcase his offense every game
nba,not_removed,i agree with the part george still shoots to much and doesnt drive and finish like harden does even if he doesnt finish he gets fouled
nba,not_removed,not just hardens shot creation hes also more efficient more consistent and much better at distributing than pg
nba,not_removed,oh you can talk now cause warriors finally mattered
nba,not_removed,gonna have to go with harden because his entire offensive game isnt reliant on his shot being on
nba,not_removed,yea of course they are i just wondered how he got picked is all
nba,not_removed,he is an elite perimeter defender unfortunately offensive stats tend to help win the mvp more than great defense since it doesnt look flashy in a box score still he was one of best defenders in the league last year and was still top in the league in scoring
nba,not_removed,man he was more than ppg behind durant that season and behind him on pretty much every other stat as well
nba,not_removed,man hes turning this season youre talking about him as if he was a rookie pg is very good hes an allstar caliber player but theres a gap between allstar and mvp that i just dont see him bridging and since there are younger players in the league that are better than him i also dont think hes going to get his time in the future
nba,not_removed,he has all the tools to be a top player in the nba for sure the best in the league not a chance he doesnt have the all around ability of bron the scoring of steph or kd or even the offence of harden let alone rws ability to dominate
nba,not_removed,even kd admitted wanda durant deserved to win that year
nba,not_removed,dunno mandurant has a trend of elite pgs outperforming him lately
nba,not_removed,attorney facepalm
nba,not_removed,can you guys atleast be creative with this
nba,not_removed,when this shit will get old its annoying
nba,not_removed,fuck im two hours late
nba,not_removed,true i have a lab mix who needs exercise or hes a rambunctious little fuckerbut not that little
nba,not_removed,where do these puppers poop tho
nba,not_removed,hes probably not gonna get a seed almost certainly though which puts him out of contention i think the same applies to paul george
nba,not_removed,why not say if he averages the most points on the highest win team that easily put him in the runnings
nba,not_removed,doh seemed so much longer ago but didnt they start not playing as well down the stretch i feel like how they ended felt anticlimatic
nba,not_removed,hes one of the top players in the league won gold at olympics in a much talked about comeback season after a horrific injury is a really likable guy oh and hes good friends with and pg is ronnies favorite player so that helps
nba,not_removed,hes a monster son
nba,not_removed,his end of season stats and the pacers record that year dont reflect how much they rekt the start of that season he was an mvp candidate at the allstar break
nba,not_removed,but was he a bitch durant padded that stat too much
nba,not_removed,mvp doesnt stand for best player it stands for most valuable player
nba,not_removed,hes in that gap between allstar and the cream of the crop like paul pierce great player top easy but hes not on the level of kd lbj steph and unless he gets better at everything except defense
nba,not_removed,wanda averaged on shooting that year such a scrub
nba,not_removed,which ones
nba,not_removed,its occasionally funny but it was so forced in this instance
nba,not_removed,finally paul george was the highest scorer on the best team in the east in averaging a much better statline than kyries last healthy year he came in in mvp votes below al jefferson
nba,not_removed,same reason kd and curry are less likely to win playing together because kyrie plays with lebron also if kyries scoring like ppg more than his last fully healthy season lebron and love will probably be scoring less which means even less assists for kyrie remember that wade put up next to bron in and didnt get a single mvp vote realistically kyrie has no chance we cant even solidify him as a top pg no way he makes the jump to a top player especially not when he shares the court with two other players who have gotten mvp consideration in the past
nba,not_removed,yeah both pg and the team started out hot slumped after the all star break but still played the heat pretty well
nba,not_removed,makes sense thanks
nba,not_removed,at the allstar break he was averaging points rebounds and assists shooting from the field and from three that is not for any season in nba history mvp stats
nba,not_removed,no shit
nba,not_removed,yeah but she was a defensive monster that year nobody scored on her in fact the other team never scored when she was on the court all you have to do is get a point lead and then sub in wanda durant to clinch the w
nba,not_removed,literally none
nba,not_removed,derrick rose was the highest scorer on the best team in the east in averaging and won mvp im not saying kyrie is the favorite but hes a decent dark horse candidate if hes playing minutes per game and cleveland wins the east
nba,not_removed,would you have said in that rose had a chance at mvp the following season its just a dark horse candidate suggestion but what puts him above guys like westbrook davis harden etc is that hes on a great team and mvps are historically from top teams
nba,not_removed,they got demolished by the heat
nba,not_removed,straight from shaqs mouth
nba,not_removed,people always say the all star break for some reason but it was more like first months the all star game is actually a decent amount of time after the middle of the season imo
nba,not_removed,while im inclined to agree theres also more to mvp voting than ptsrebast and shooting
nba,not_removed,thats not even what lillard averaged this whole last season people constantly over rating him
nba,not_removed,my point is that hell never be the best player in the league or even statistically have the best season but he could still win mvp
nba,not_removed,the back to back mvp
nba,not_removed,but drose was the entire offense i see your logic but im saying its really not plausible kyrie needs to step up his game and become that focal point of the cavs offense and on a team with lebron and love i dont think thats likely especially since drose had a great narrative and his team was crap i think the player to have a season similar to droses mvp season would be pg but his teams full of offensive power and no defense
nba,not_removed,once we lost home court advantage it was over we planned all year for having that game at home but couldnt do it came close demolished is a strong word
nba,not_removed,the series was they lost by a lot in games but they didnt get demolished i think
nba,not_removed,shaq has never been wrong
nba,not_removed,yeah i hate that half of people just look at offense for mvp voting defense is half of the game of basketball
nba,not_removed,so u r saying its over after game
nba,not_removed,would have been except lebron picked up four phantom fouls in the first quarter of game
nba,not_removed,ill take his opinion over yours
nba,not_removed,elite offense is just generally more valuable than elite defense i dont know if it means anything but advanced stats like box plus minus and win shares tend to show this
nba,not_removed,we lost game at home and it ruined everything when we lost in games in the whole team talked about getting the first seed so that game would be at home beating those heat teams on the road was tough and i dont think lebron was gonna lose a clinching game at home
nba,not_removed,why would you take his opinion over kennys though id say kenny is the best analyst on that crew for sure
nba,not_removed,obviously kd and lebron were the best that year the point is there was a small window in the past that pg was considered an mvp candidate by a lot of people so him being an mvp in the future isnt too far fetched give him a decent team and a healthy year and he could be mvp
nba,not_removed,steph curry leads with points assists and rebounds as gsw move past okc and advance to the finals for the consecutive time
nba,not_removed,grizzlies are like a foreign country just getting friends on tv
nba,not_removed,the game has changed
nba,not_removed,the grizzlies are in grit n grind w
nba,not_removed,this jennifer aniston girl might have a future in acting ill tell you what
nba,not_removed,underrated brook lopez marc gasol and demarcus cousins all becoming aboveaverage shooters out of nowhere shooting and respectively
nba,not_removed,its not only the top guys but the guys that are next in line fucking shit up i mean look at gianniskembacousinsblakebutleretcthese guys are having top player seasons and all of them could be argued out the top ten for sure top ten players are two spots left for butler blake cousins walker lillard derozan giannisetc etc even guys like it is having a career year hassan is a monster kevin love is a beast this season george hill has a real case of being better than lillardwallkemba draymond green is a fucking defensive monsteri mean does a player like lma or klay make top anymore shits insane
nba,not_removed,yeah this shit has been unreal harden especially ive always been kind of a hater mostly because i never really liked his play style but the man can flat out ball
nba,not_removed,giannis should be on this list imo averaging with steals and blocks very rare
nba,not_removed,durant is having an amazing year surprised no one posts more about it
nba,not_removed,whiteside with the and too
nba,not_removed,demar although he seemed to have cooled down a bit
nba,not_removed,remember when that fucking idiot tracy mcgrady said the league is watered down
nba,not_removed,greatest toptier talent the league has ever had
nba,not_removed,for real even the tier stars are going off lillard with on ts it on kemba with on etc
nba,not_removed,dont forget demarcus cousins numbers ppg rpg apg spg bpg
nba,not_removed,before today was on pace for a top season in at and nobodys even talking about him
nba,not_removed,slightly irrelevantrelevant but this year has had one of the most parity for top picks in fantasy something is definitely different this year not sure if this breaks the rules but ill delete the comment if you guys think its irrelevant but i have never seen such eye bulging stats and distributed so well heres some stats you might only notice if you are following fantasy but definitely should be part of the bizzare numbers should also be on this list with his absurd shooting percentages and ridiculous steals giannis should be here dont need fantasy for this kawhi is averaging fts a game and making it at westbrook is shooting fts vs hardens a lot of players are also putting up massive ft numbers this year point shooting is also massively up in terms of percentages across the board with an example being kemba walker shooting at an absurd overall rate of with a game curry definitely made everyone bring their a game lillard has also improved his shooting from a to a very strong despite how much he shoots amazing numbers across the board
nba,not_removed,this is the most talent the league has had since the early it might even be better a historically great era and its not just the people op listed there are a lot of very talented young players who are not yet putting such numbers older superstars about to exit their prime and then of course superstar players in their doing ridiculous things the nba is deservedly doing better than all other professional sports leagues
nba,not_removed,my myplayer averages almost ppg apg spg and rpg what an insane season yes i play on easy
nba,not_removed,the start of every season tends to have some unreal outputs things will settle
nba,not_removed,traditional positions are going away and star players are being tasked with all around roles you have forwards running point better than some guards guards getting more rebounds than some centers centers and power forwards shooting better from than guards what a time
nba,not_removed,these are great offensive stats but should we look at defensive stats besides rebounds too theoretically it would be easy to ge these offensive stats if no one is playing defense
nba,not_removed,does anyone know the last person that has put up the consistent numbers that russ has i know obviously oscar but who else has averaged a triple double this late in the season
nba,not_removed,dont forget the process
nba,not_removed,cousins was a capable shooter last year on fairly high volume so there was at least some sign he had the range lopez and gasol though are bizarre both had good touch on their midrange jumpers but nothing at all like this
nba,not_removed,isaiah thomas is averaging
nba,not_removed,i think derozan is probably a must include in the top but you are spot on
nba,not_removed,i cant stand the guy and at the game tonight i certainly yelled at the refs a couple times with the way he controls them but shit man that guy can play
nba,not_removed,harden freshest clothes hottest dudes etc
nba,not_removed,some of it is because he is getting assisted on on and of which is insane for an mvp candidate its a little unfair because hes playing with curry klay and draymond cant double kd ever anymore
nba,not_removed,im not surprised
nba,not_removed,jeremy lamb did better than that
nba,not_removed,lol thats nothing compared to the stats he listed
nba,not_removed,yeah hes been his typical self recently thankfully so has lowry now so its balanced out
nba,not_removed,i like that is considered cooled down used to be the measure for an elite wing in the nba
nba,not_removed,that man is all about disrespect i dont like him i remember this one time he and duncan came out to the press conference together after an all star game dont remember the context but i remember him calling duncans game boring td seriously got up and left i get that from a casual fan perspective but how can you say that as a player does he not appreciate the subtleties i also remember him saying things like it feels good to finally get out of the first round after being up he straight up insulted his teammates saying baron davis has a supporting cast and he doesnt after losing in the first round to the hornets he also admitted to mailing it in after leading the magic to the worst record in the league
nba,not_removed,didnt he mean the competition sucked which is irrelevant to stat inflation the competition still is weak if you dont think the warriors and cavs are going to the finals you still trippin
nba,not_removed,easily the greatest top mid and bottom tier talent the nba has ever had this is why lebron james is the best palyer to ever touch a basketball that weve seen on planet earth the level of play happening right now is so far and above what magicbird did in the much much higher than the with so many expansion teams weve got international players weve got more sophisticated coaching weve got smarter players this is the best era of basketball ever by a lot i mean by a fucking lot
nba,not_removed,the clippers had a hot start once their record normalises so will the players not a knock on but its a lot easier to have a high when youre than at
nba,not_removed,instead of hating on players which i see too much unfortunately we should celebrate all the greatness that is showcased every damn day
nba,not_removed,steals per game
nba,not_removed,not like this a quarter into the season
nba,not_removed,there was that stretch where mj played the point and averaged about also for a month last year westbrook was averaging about i would assume lebron has had stretches where hes balled out for me personally this is the first time ive seen someone start out like this and keep it going nearly a quarter in to the season the dude has a fuckin motor
nba,not_removed,not even an attempt at a joke nothing just
nba,not_removed,the lead the thunder had before they choked
nba,not_removed,this isnt nba memes
nba,not_removed,the bar had been lowered
nba,not_removed,joel steph curry embiid
nba,not_removed,lopez could always shoot just never had the green light
nba,not_removed,thing about cousins is that for a tall guy built like a linebacker he has a very smooth ball touch and great shooting skills this is something to behold his game is unique
nba,not_removed,hes put up most of his career tho
nba,not_removed,i dont think he is top though
nba,not_removed,nah son
nba,not_removed,what about the chillest restaurants
nba,not_removed,there is nothing unfair about it parity is not the same as fairness and you can hurt one while not touching the other not the best for parity that kd went to gsw but what makes him kd is the ability to put up those stats when he has open shots you cant say meh what a system because we literally have seen what a decent shooting person with amazing athletic abilities does when plugged into the warriorsthats just harrison barnes kd went to a team where he could make history and fit into the most potent offense in nba history i think thats fair and so is every shot they hit stats and projections and spacing are important but you have to hit the shots
nba,not_removed,i bet kg shaq and malone were around the same assisted in their mvp years definitely unusual for a wing though
nba,not_removed,not sure how thats a knock on durant the warriors avg assists a game and their offense is pass heavy and not one guy going on all the time
nba,not_removed,and has happened twice since so pretty rare and only times since so
nba,not_removed,you probably right
nba,not_removed,hes not scoring as prolifically but hes passing incredibly well
nba,not_removed,you cant base whether he has cooled down recently on his season averages hes averaging around on low fg over this last games including a game and a clunker
nba,not_removed,duncan is an all time great and tmac is an all time what if of course hes salty if he thought duncan was boring then he didnt understand winning which he proved in his game as well
nba,not_removed,ok well he said that last year when there were at least really great teams warriors spurs thunder clippers cavs
nba,not_removed,this is why lebron james is the best palyer to ever touch a basketball that weve seen on planet earth christ man do we have to go that far
nba,not_removed,you obviously didnt watch much ball in the
nba,not_removed,pres dont fuck around
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,same with big spain
nba,not_removed,i would probably say davis westbrook harden leonard durant lbj curry derozan lillard in that order imo but i could definitely see variation in that list
nba,not_removed,yall are pathetic lol
nba,not_removed,its a little different for bigs yeah you dont ever really dribble unless someone passes to you as a big
nba,not_removed,i think its not a knock but in a way it kinda shows that his scoring is easier compared to other guys that dont have the benefit of a super duper team
nba,not_removed,well hes an elite scorer who gets assisted waaaaay more than most elite players its worth mentioning
nba,not_removed,still pretty great though
nba,not_removed,i used his last games which is a perfectly fine sample size according to espn hes averaging on shooting in that time period i would consider poor shooting nights against of the worst defensive teams in the league in sacramento and philly as off nights rather than regression i also dont think its fair to say hes regressed based completely on stats the last games the team has been on the road playing their toughest stretch of the season and hes clearly focused more on finding his teammates averaging fga in the last rather than for the season
nba,not_removed,no this was or where mcgrady was still or close to top players in the league his hopes and dreams were still alive
nba,not_removed,i do at every opportunity unabashedly i might add
nba,not_removed,much much higher than the with so many expansion teams seriously lol orlando had shaq and penny toronto had vince and tmac charlotte had mourning miami had mourning and glen rice minnesota had kg other than vancouver the expansion teams werent bad for more than a couple of years there was plenty of talent and thats not including the talent that the rest of the league already had
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,i would put butler before demar and damien
nba,not_removed,his scoring is easier compared to other guys that dont have the benefit of a super duper team valid point but his team also has the most wins so its not like theyre doing less with more the super team argument would do better to invalidate his production if the warriors only had the same win percentage as one of the teams that are just getting by because of or stars
nba,not_removed,theyve only played games all season
nba,not_removed,dont forget larry johnson and muggsy for charlotte
nba,not_removed,not expansion teams either jordan pippen webber stockton malone payton kemp robinson hakeem barkley kevin johnson the were stacked
nba,not_removed,havent really paid close attention to jimmy buckets this season is he putting up derozan type numbers
nba,not_removed,they had a better win percentage last year
nba,not_removed,and hes had bad shooting nights
nba,not_removed,they had a better win percentage last year i was comparing against other teams not against last season i just didnt properly articulate my point i guess
nba,not_removed,not just two bad shooting nights in of those games he shot below his season average from the field in of those games he shot less than his average number of free throws on the season while hes not know for his three point shooting he didnt make a in of the games its a minislump likely because of the schedule and lowry finally arriving but his earlier pace was unsustainable hell settle in somewhere in between how he did in the first games and how hes done in the last handful
nba,not_removed,lol and dwights gonna get yeah fucking right
nba,not_removed,the bulls couldnt sign melo so melo brought the bulls with him to ny
nba,not_removed,remember that time derrick rose refused to recruit carmelo anthony
nba,not_removed,we are turning into the yankees by signing these old ass players
nba,not_removed,hope this is just a rumor i want noah but is just too steep for me
nba,not_removed,hollllllllllllllly shit thats a lot of money for an injury prone guy on the decline and hasnt been in the top half of starting centers in the last two years hope its not a longterm deal makes sense if its a deal but more than that would get ugly
nba,not_removed,give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to be free statue of liberty
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,knicks must have a time machine with the line up they are putting together
nba,not_removed,around million thats the number his agent is throwing out
nba,not_removed,interesting move theres a high ceiling on this squad but to say that it is risky would be a massive understatement at the very least i think noahs intensity and leadership could be great for porzingis development
nba,not_removed,gimme rolo at all day over noah at lol wow
nba,not_removed,holy shit tristan thompsons contract is looking better all the time
nba,not_removed,im cool with for years but anything more long term than that is just plain dumb
nba,not_removed,upresidentbaxter and utetsuoandkaneda have both stated in the knicks subreddit that million is million in the real terms of last season or of the cap of this season robin lopezs contract was around of the cap when he signed last season
nba,not_removed,so what thats around per year on the old cap wild overpay for what he did last year if he can return to a great rebounderrim protector and elbow passer really not a terrible deal
nba,not_removed,i said in the knicks sub that they would probably offer a for about million total i really hope its a
nba,not_removed,what a fucking waste you can sign a b tier fa for less and get the same production a broken down noah will give you
nba,not_removed,can we just change our logo to crying jordan already
nba,not_removed,so instead of melo going to the bulls the bulls came to him
nba,not_removed,i would have loved to overpay for noah man but im happy for him hope he does well with the knicks
nba,not_removed,remember that bulls team we expected with melo two years ago bout that
nba,not_removed,everyone relax this is what you have to pay for a starting caliber center in the inflated cap world if its not too long its completely fine
nba,not_removed,when crabbe and harkless gets and seth curry and etwan moore gets mil this contract wont seem too bad
nba,not_removed,what is this strange sensation im having towards the knicksits not contempt mockery or hatred those im familiar with
nba,not_removed,man yall bitch a lot when you have no idea how this will realistically pan out
nba,not_removed,rip bargains
nba,not_removed,derrick knows it joakim knows it
nba,not_removed,this has the potential to be a very exciting team to watch didnt expect the noah to knicks rumors to be this advanced
nba,not_removed,i think this is great for nyk if noah can be healthy and treated right he and rose are awesome compliments for melo and porzingis
nba,not_removed,so instead of melo going to the bulls the bulls are going to melo
nba,not_removed,i like how people are shitting on the contract like the price on the mid isnt up welcome to free agency
nba,not_removed,per year or total if its per then maybe years ago lol werent bull fans trashing noah last year for how useless he was especially in that cavs series
nba,not_removed,idk about that
nba,not_removed,and so it begins
nba,not_removed,i think its a good deal for them theyre bringing in someone who rose is familiar with so theres some guaranteed some chemistry there plus they just traded lopez and theres no way porzingis would be ready to start if theyre making a playoff push
nba,not_removed,if this new cap increase means guys get overpaid on year contracts im okay with that all that means is its the end of dynasties and teams are just going to make short runs at titles which should make teams and players a lot more competitive sounds crazy but that would be very interesting for any fan it means your team actually has a chance at any point to be relevant
nba,not_removed,the squad would have been goat in
nba,not_removed,wait that cant be a year that just cant be
nba,not_removed,the knicks sign eric gordon for
nba,not_removed,how is this legal they arent supposed to be able to talk until tomorrow
nba,not_removed,why not just resign amare while were at it knicks cant stop themselves from paying big for over the hillinjured stars kill me
nba,not_removed,a year pay horford hawks
nba,not_removed,the nba is going to be so broken with these deals a bunch of mediocre relative to superstar players are going to get paid an absurd amount the true stars are going to be making and of the league is going to be playing for the minimum
nba,not_removed,if you cant beat em buy em
nba,not_removed,oh man we are total gonna win the nba title
nba,not_removed,perfect just ordered my new hat
nba,not_removed,lets go bulls east woooo firehoiberg firegarpax
nba,not_removed,wtf this is obviously a stupid deal boban marjanovic has more potential than noah
nba,not_removed,knicks are so fucked
nba,not_removed,what a waste of money
nba,not_removed,i wanna die
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,new bong alert he blows
nba,not_removed,man the knicks are gonna be so good in
nba,not_removed,ew
nba,not_removed,mil for years
nba,not_removed,tts contract doesnt look that ridiculous now does it
nba,not_removed,wow simmons was very very right on any given wednesday about the knicks continually signing people five years too late
nba,not_removed,brothers
nba,not_removed,i love noah butjust when you think the knicks fo was making smarter decisions they go back to their old ways unless its a deal then it should be finei hope
nba,not_removed,im not sure what the knicks are thinking hes getting paid less than that now im almost sure you could get him for like mill a yr i think noah fits better than anyone in the league because of his emotion since melo rose porzingis are all quite af and you need someone like noah to have success but mill someone needs to get fired or is terrible at negotiations
nba,not_removed,man i love jo but i dont know if i love him that much how about we start at and increase you every year
nba,not_removed,this only solidifies dwights argument for seems proportional
nba,not_removed,knicks fans wait till we see the real numbers before you freak out just last season we were supposed to be paying afflalo before the real numbers came out let everyone else s on the rumored deal
nba,not_removed,i thought noah was just a decent roleplayer at this stage injuries have taken their toll hope this deal isnt true for knicks fans
nba,not_removed,for that stiff what a time to be alive
nba,not_removed,million per year
nba,not_removed,hope thats totalknow it wont be though
nba,not_removed,how does this have barely up votes i had to scroll so far down the rnba feed to find it this is huge
nba,not_removed,knicks gonna be hella good on
nba,not_removed,knicks tape
nba,not_removed,why
nba,not_removed,this isnt that bad of a deal he has had injury problems but hes one of the only fa centers available that can pass well enough for the triangle to work i think its a solid signing by the knicks he should compliment porzingis well im sure hes glad to be home in ny too
nba,not_removed,and people saying dwight getting the max or close to it is ridiculousor not likely its gonna happen
nba,not_removed,knicks fans are happy about this
nba,not_removed,but but thibberwolves
nba,not_removed,end of an era thank you jo for the good times in chicago
nba,not_removed,people need to remember that mil is not the same value as it was years ago equals more to a year contract years ago
nba,not_removed,no way dwight gets less than noah good signing by the knicks though
nba,not_removed,if this happens im becoming more and more inclined to roof for the knicks to beat our ass
nba,not_removed,great character and culture builder guy but not sure he will be able to stay healthy
nba,not_removed,goddamnit god speed noah you ugly magnificent bastard ill always love you for game at the nets
nba,not_removed,but but what about kd
nba,not_removed,per year or total no way noah is worth a year right i mean hes great but a year
nba,not_removed,in what world is joakim noah worth my guesses are
nba,not_removed,i would like noah in dallas but is crazy
nba,not_removed,ny loves chicago athletes rose noah forte marshall castro
nba,not_removed,allegedly there is a mutual interest between both parties so hopefully phil negotiates and brings the price down it probably shouldnt be too hard to either noah has every reason to leave chicago and go to the knicks so hopefully money doesnt play a huge role for him
nba,not_removed,brb gonna go jump off a cliff if this is true
nba,not_removed,my friend kept telling me they should pick up whiteside mostly because hes a big fan of his after a while though he made me start to want that too
nba,not_removed,y tho
nba,not_removed,oh damnnn thats a lot of money butplayoffs
nba,not_removed,new york bulls are looking good this year
nba,not_removed,wow i want rose melo and joakim to win a title so bad i think the knicks might have just become my main team to root for next year and they have one of the most intriguing rookies in a long time coming into his sophomore campagin barring injury this team will be amazing to watch bravo zen master michaeljacksonpopcornjpg
nba,not_removed,dude go be an assistant coach with the gators or somethingyour game has now matched your jumpshot
nba,not_removed,generous deal noah will be happy with this
nba,not_removed,holy fuck thats a lot
nba,not_removed,yeeeesh a bit steep
nba,not_removed,its almost like isiah thomas is still around yeesh
nba,not_removed,lol mil for kanter is gonna be a nice contract soon
nba,not_removed,lol that dude sucks ass
nba,not_removed,a lot of you guys in these comments are really pessimistic just because this is the knicks as free agency goes on middle of the road teams are going to get desperate and overpay whatever rotation caliber player available im kind of glad we are locking down jo now before his value really gets over inflated by what other defensive bigs get offered
nba,not_removed,i really like noah but id definitely be worried about his injury issues im worried hes breaking down on top of that you gotta deal with roses injury history high risk high reward hopefully they dont give him more than years at that price
nba,not_removed,knicks are going to be praying he can stay healthy and be a shell of his self i can see why they did the signing given the familiarity with rose but the knicks are definitely rolling the dice with this one only time will tell
nba,not_removed,♫ reunited and it feels so good ♫
nba,not_removed,ok ill admit my wizards knicks bet might have been made a bit too soon but i believe well get it done
nba,not_removed,excited to see porzingis learn from joakim
nba,not_removed,i hope these knicks fans realize rose and noah cant jump anymore i watched every game last year and rose didnt dunk all season maybe theyll be good this year though
nba,not_removed,the knickest thing
nba,not_removed,holy shit knicks hire at least one player who is ascending
nba,not_removed,aw phuc i cant believe youve done this now i cant cheer for the knicks
nba,not_removed,i like seeing these together
nba,not_removed,as negative as everyone is being he would be a great fit next to porzingis as a defender and a passer that said if this is true and for more than years i will literally lol
nba,not_removed,aand now the starting lineup for your new york knicks
nba,not_removed,in the nba world noah sounds easily more valuable to get other star players like wade or durant
nba,not_removed,he couldnt hit a layup last year and now hes getting mil never change nba
nba,not_removed,i dont see noah making more than dwight so if this happens
nba,not_removed,well atleast he can still hate cleveland
nba,not_removed,what an awful deal
nba,not_removed,youre joakim
nba,not_removed,thank you new york wizards fan
nba,not_removed,unless its a or year deal l o fucking l
nba,not_removed,i wanted noah for the twolves but thought hed come at a discount not option money
nba,not_removed,i think this is a bad move personally i feel like the knicks are rushing kristapss growth i would rather the knicks sign younger players to help with him
nba,not_removed,please dont commit long term money please dont commit longterm money i saw a rumor that the knicks are looking at eric gordon phil may be trying to stealth tank while still selling tickets
nba,not_removed,lol knicks
nba,not_removed,we better not fucking pay him a year he was unreal three years ago but hes broken down this would cripple our ability to sign other quality free agents and our team is thin enough as it is not to mention thats of our starting who are injury risks really hope this is misinformation would love to have noah but not at that price
nba,not_removed,i love how all the bulls fans are talking shit now but if he would have signed with them it would be a completely different story oh maybe noah can bounce back he was a dpoy only two years ago it can happen lol
nba,not_removed,rose noah porzingis and melo in the triangle is scary has the potential to be beautiful basketball im excited to see them in action this is coming from a bulls fan
nba,not_removed,as umostafajal said in rknicks remember last year when everyone said the knicks were gonna sign afflalo for around milyr but we got him for just lets wait it out
nba,not_removed,can someone please slap dolan
nba,not_removed,mil is too much but nice
nba,not_removed,the ny bulls
nba,not_removed,goddamn how much will someone like horford and howard will make after this
nba,not_removed,great pickup for the knicks but how is joakim returning to nyc and also i feel bad for jimmy butler now bulls sank to probably a lotto team
nba,not_removed,the biggest loss is not to the team but to the city jo was hugely influential in the fight to clean up the streets of chicago and reduce the violence he also had tremendous pride in not just the team itself but to where it was located as well i expect nothing less as he returns to his home town
nba,not_removed,mil for a center with no post game and above average defense i get that he would be a nice piece but come on noah isnt that good
nba,not_removed,okay so heres what i know noah used to be great but is now somewhere between above average and good noah is injury prone af the knicks cap number for is the knicks cap number for is projected obv the knicks have all of their rounders for the forseeable future derrick rose has one year left on his contract heres how i feel is way too much for noah at this stage of his career when all those dudes are healthy and playing it might actually be fun to watch i have no delusions about this team being a contender we should not give him more than years max ideally we give noah plus a team option if these players rose noah are meant to be core pieces of a championship contender then i think that phil jackson has either lost his mind or lost control of the team from a basketball perspective these moves remind me more of jimmy dolan than phil jackson that said i could see these signings as a lastminute hail mary to try and contend while carmelo is still the best player on the team if and when that fails you still have tons of flexibility on the back end but only if we sign noah to a short deal if everything falls apart early season you can trade melo to a title contender and get assets back
nba,not_removed,that feel when i may just support the knicks because they have part of the old bulls core
nba,not_removed,years ago we were playing semi conference finals against cavs with lineup rosebutlerdunleavygasolnoahwe were leading and then gasol got injured and we lost if we managed to get games from cavs with that lineup i am pretty sure that drosemelokpnoah and guard could even play conference finals for sure if they all stay healthy
nba,not_removed,are they trying to get the all star team together
nba,not_removed,million with this cap is like previously ill take that
nba,not_removed,so glad he didnt end up signing in milwaukee he refused to even workout for the bucks when he was going for the draft progress
nba,not_removed,just knicks things
nba,not_removed,good for you jo
nba,not_removed,why is anyone paying noah to play last i saw him play he couldnt shoot too slow on defense barely could lift himself to the rim on layups am i missing something
nba,not_removed,even a broken clock is right twice a day with the amount of beat writers in ny pretty much every free agent is reported as wanting to put on a knicks jersey ill believe it when i see it
nba,not_removed,do we call them the chicago knicks or the new york bulls
nba,not_removed,too much money we need a nice guy at sg and an efficient center who doesnt draw spotlight
nba,not_removed,bulls fan here i love joakim i really do but watching him failing to make a layup was one of the more frustrating things i had ever endured as a bulls fan
nba,not_removed,at first i thought it was mil total and i was like thats a pretty good deal i guess i couldnt comprehend how would someone be so stupid to even consider paying noah that much money but then again we are going to give rondo more so yeah fuck me in the ass
nba,not_removed,a serious overpay unless they have some insight into his health that bulls fans dont injuries severely hampered his ability to leap run the floor and move laterally while he is still a great passer smart defender and a locker room leader you cannot pay more for a downgrade who wont deserve starters minutes i figured they would be pursuing howard whiteside or horford maybe this is a prelude to a horford signing if they can afford it despite that seeming impossible maybe he looks really good after rehab and time offi am rooting for the new bulls but this is an iffy move
nba,not_removed,the chicago knicks rose player x melo zinger and noah the funny thing is that in some alternate universe this could be our team this year trading butlerportisfeleciotaj and several rounders for melozinger this is going to be an interesting year
nba,not_removed,if its then its great right aww hell no its actually per year wtf
nba,not_removed,so im a knicks fan now
nba,not_removed,not only do i dislike noah but i dislike this deal the guy is well past his prime and hes not going to add million dollars of value to any team
nba,not_removed,mil today is the equivalent of under a salary cap so its not that crazy please only be years
nba,not_removed,its a risky deal but its worth the risk given that rose loves noah noah is a heartandsoul guy even if his production has slid and frankly jacksons only goal is to maximize what can be done with the situation of an aging carmelo that they cant move whether this works or not jackson is out in a couple of years due to age or lifestyle choices
nba,not_removed,shit on phil all you want but hell have a core of rose melo porzingus and noah the is absolutely in better shape than when he got there
nba,not_removed,overpaying for old players is totally our thing
nba,not_removed,what the fuck the moratorium period hasnt even started yet
nba,not_removed,this seems like a bad idea
nba,not_removed,no top guys want to play with melo so this is what the knicks have to resort to jesus
nba,not_removed,never forget who you are new york you get dwight howard and turn your team into a shitshow to entertain the whole league stay in your lane knicks
nba,not_removed,to be fair i think noah mightve checked out on hoiberg and the bulls really early last season if hes relatively healthy i could see playing for his hometown team bringing out a lot in him i love joakim and as a knicks fan i know the only hope of seeing most of my favorite players on the team is when theyre washed up anyway so whatever im really happy about this
nba,not_removed,y pay for this guy at this price ny if you make this happen i dont know what you are thinking hahaha
nba,not_removed,idk about this i thought we got rose to speed up and play porz large minutes at center signing noah makes it look like the triangle is staying put and i just dont see rose thriving in that situation ugh
nba,not_removed,big men will always find big pay days in the nba
nba,not_removed,big men will always find big pay days in the nba
nba,not_removed,the knicks seem to be trying to maximize their talent level while carmelo is still around i understand it they arent going to contend vs cle lets be real but it either this approach or trade carmello and he can refuse a trade
nba,not_removed,lets do this love me some jo in ny
nba,not_removed,where is dwight going to end up now
nba,not_removed,can someone explain why some are saying why a long term deal is dumb if nyc does a short term deal and they really want to keep noah wont they risk losing him if noah decides to leave some where else
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,im going to watch more knicks games this season than ive done in my entire life
nba,not_removed,drose hasnt won his last mvp yet and jno hasnt finished in mvp voting for the last time either optimistic knicks fans
nba,not_removed,oh man i am going to hate these knicks should be fun
nba,not_removed,lmao if this happens bc the knicks are going to be worse off than the nets at least the nets made the playoffs when they brought kg and pierce over anthony rose and noah feel bad for kristaps
nba,not_removed,this is a great team years ago
nba,not_removed,now we know why melo signed with the knicks
nba,not_removed,i spend of my time thinking and analyzing hockey and hockey salaries this number kind of blows my mind
nba,not_removed,knicks arent making the playoffs i take it
nba,not_removed,i mean i like him but
nba,not_removed,what a horrible idea
nba,not_removed,so million a year for noah anyone still want to argue that tristan thompson was overpaid
nba,not_removed,this is awesome my favorite east team is coming together
nba,not_removed,ny dum if they sign him for hes worth more like mil
nba,not_removed,thats it i am officially a knicks fan i was flirting with the idea when they brought in kp who looks like a young dirk in my opinion this just solidified it
nba,not_removed,what a terrible hire this knicks team is so injury prone or old they wont make it through the season
nba,not_removed,derrick rose is scott hall and joakim noah is kevin nash but whos the third man
nba,not_removed,i like how nobody even questions the fact that teams cant even speak with players and negotiate contracts yet
nba,not_removed,kyrie irving makes million a year
nba,not_removed,wow the knicks really do love to fuck themselves mil a season for washed up noah hes worth a quarter of that max i had hope for nyk when they got d rose but its very clear to me that they are going to be garbage fire again
nba,not_removed,take care of him ny favorite bull since scottie sniff edit why the fuck would somebody downvote this rnba is amazing sometimes
nba,not_removed,cant bring carmelo to the bulls bring the bulls to carmelo
nba,not_removed,havent the knicks learned anything from allan houston
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,big if true
nba,not_removed,yo wtf i got noah in gm mode for mil
nba,not_removed,is isaiah back in ny this guy sucks why pay him anything
nba,not_removed,in other news derrick rose knees are set to sign a renewal contract worth about the same
nba,not_removed,smart move knicks trying our strategy that failed
nba,not_removed,new york adding all the pieces to successfully finish in the east
nba,not_removed,hows he gonna return if hes from chicago
nba,not_removed,starting around i really cant blame the bulls for getting rid of these over payed mediocre players why are bull fans so mad over this not prime players worth prime money anymore time to move on i wish management would to tho
nba,not_removed,yeah thats a severely low figure guys like ezeli who could only hope to become present day dwight howard will be getting
nba,not_removed,hes with injury issues dwight is with less injury issues i dont think either one will play more than years and dwight will be good for another noah good for another probably so hopefully no year maxes
nba,not_removed,yeah if its per then thats stupid for whoever is offering him that hes been a shell of his former self the last seasons for dwight is reasonable
nba,not_removed,i expect noah to have a short deal in ny while would command a year contract a for a year is quite fair id say
nba,not_removed,i tried to say even if the top tier teams didnt want to bite half the league is offering him at least pau qualifies for the same max that howard does too so both are getting fucking paid
nba,not_removed,everyone knows by now how demands in the team affects both the fo and locker room negatively if he isnt motivated so at this point in time id rather get noah over him
nba,not_removed,according to dwight hes getting
nba,not_removed,dwight will probably get mil more likely on the higher end of that range
nba,not_removed,but dwight is garbage s
nba,not_removed,why would anyone think that now its one of those very few rare times in the nba where salaries get crazy some team some where will offer any starter an obscene amount of money and any role players and borderline stars a max or close salaries will once again stabilize many will have longer contracts but right now any capable player is grabbing all the money they can shorter deals opt outs etc the kent brazemores of the world jump from to make times more money than you have so far in just two years then resign for a little less for more years right now and may be again in two years or so any and all types of contracts will be written
nba,not_removed,if you cant beat them but you also cant join them get your team to pay them millions to join you
nba,not_removed,about years too late hope rose comes back and wrecks dudes tho
nba,not_removed,i feel like i a made a wish with a genie and said i wish kristaps porzingis was playing with the bulls and the genie is owning me for not being specific enough
nba,not_removed,godfuckingdammit melo he did practically what lebron did to him too
nba,not_removed,i too saw that comment in a thread a few days ago
nba,not_removed,see guys money does buy friendship
nba,not_removed,they should pick up jimmy too
nba,not_removed,then again the bulls melo brought to ny isnt the or bulls
nba,not_removed,the hornless bulls
nba,not_removed,everyone criticized melo for not going to the bulls but i dont think he wouldve won a championship either way
nba,not_removed,the long con
nba,not_removed,years late
nba,not_removed,i always believed when those stories came out it was more of a look we dont need a guy who needed to cheat on sats to get into memphis in our executive meetings sorta thing derricks really dumb hes like lenny in mice men
nba,not_removed,except you know wo fucking rings
nba,not_removed,weve always signed players a few years too late its as essential to the knicks organization as the colors blue and orange
nba,not_removed,you mean the knicks
nba,not_removed,i love jo with all my heart but ill let him walk if hes going for mil
nba,not_removed,woudnt it be just like the knicks to sign d rose and noah but then they both get injured in the preseason
nba,not_removed,i would if its just for year
nba,not_removed,what are the other options though the knicks will still have cap space to add another free agent in too
nba,not_removed,what if it is
nba,not_removed,way too steep for howard is a much better option
nba,not_removed,you guys have on the books right now for the cap floor is going up from about to near you might as well spend that money
nba,not_removed,depends how many years it is if it is years its a great deal
nba,not_removed,definitely not worth it glad we got rolo for mil years younger and can do something on offense
nba,not_removed,of a cap that percentage of this years cap would be i have my concerns over noahs health and ability to hold up but as long as its not a four year deal i dont think the contract is that unreasonable were just not used to the numbers that were going to be seeing this summer yet
nba,not_removed,he cant even score i really dont know what these team are seeing
nba,not_removed,im
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,just need to bring most of the guys back in time and zingis forward
nba,not_removed,imagine melo drose and noah all in prime form
nba,not_removed,if they had a best team of the tournament assuming everyone played up to their absolute prime the knicks might run away with it amare carmelo stephon marbury steve francis tracy mcgrady mike bibby chauncey billups baron davis penny hardaway dikembe zach randolph jamal crawford al harrington antonio mcdyess jalen rose latrell sprewell allan houston marcus camby tyson chandler vin baker etc
nba,not_removed,worked for us
nba,not_removed,cavs
nba,not_removed,i think noahs intensity and leadership could be great for porzingis development that was my first thought as well love him or hate him noah has maximized his skill set and he brings it every night
nba,not_removed,front office is making the gamble that rose and noah is better than lopez and jose or lopez and overpaying a pg on the free agent market
nba,not_removed,yea but give me rose on a yr than calderon
nba,not_removed,give me rose melo kp and noah over butler rolo and jose lol open ya eyes
nba,not_removed,really good scenario would be a
nba,not_removed,i understand that but rolo is younger healthier better and cheaper at this stage
nba,not_removed,that rolo deal was made structured with the cap jump in mind its not the same situation at all
nba,not_removed,exactly and when the cap goes to mil is going to be the equivalent of mil a few years ago
nba,not_removed,in his defense hes a great passer former dpoy and great teammatelocker room presence the knicks could use an emotional leader and enforcer like him
nba,not_removed,name one people always fail to realize that contracts always look ridiculous at the start the cap goes up and everyone is getting paid
nba,not_removed,as post above you says for only years whatever but more than that and this is atrocious
nba,not_removed,will a b tier teach kp the position as will as noah will a move like this is as much about developing kp and adding some emotional resonance to the locker room as it is about competing this year which maybe we can do if rose and noah are healthy but obviously thats not a sure thing
nba,not_removed,after the past few seasons i dont know if i want to be a bulls fan anymore i hope rose a noah with carmelo kick ass next year
nba,not_removed,if he wasnt one of the most injury prone players in the league sure its a huge overpay if hes in street clothes on the bench though
nba,not_removed,thats exactly why people are pissed hes not even close to being a starting caliber center
nba,not_removed,too bad he isnt a starting caliber center
nba,not_removed,which is why its so confusing to spend that amount of money on a center who isnt startingcaliber the guy is textbook backup center
nba,not_removed,moore gonna earn that mil
nba,not_removed,etwaun moore for million isnt bad he was straight up better than noah past year and hes definitely a rotation player with his ability to defend and create a shot
nba,not_removed,did you saybargnani
nba,not_removed,is going to be insane
nba,not_removed,the equivalent in last years salary cap would be like million thats a ridiculous amount of money to give to an injury prone center who hasnt been good for years
nba,not_removed,i just dont understand how they can know the numbers fas cant talk with teams until midnight coming to an agreement would be a clear violation no
nba,not_removed,per noahs feet are shot dude can hardly play anymore
nba,not_removed,unless youre the
nba,not_removed,rose melo noah and year old porzingis thats got nba championship written all over it
nba,not_removed,lol we gotta find the threads from last year when tt signed that deal cavs got massacred for it tt isnt a scorer so people didnt think he deserved big money but on a squad with prolific scorers already it makes sense to sign someone with his skillset
nba,not_removed,it didnt even look ridiculous when he signed it the man played at a high level on the biggest stage you pay those guys
nba,not_removed,thats not really a hot take more like common knowledge
nba,not_removed,knicks havent said anything yet this is the number that his agent is coming to the table with similar thing happened last year where it was reported afflalo would sign for of the cap and wound up signing for of the cap if noah takes of the cap he signs for about this year
nba,not_removed,i personally think gasol would have been a better fit but then who plays defense
nba,not_removed,only the ones who dont care that hes injury prone
nba,not_removed,im cautiously optimistic im a knicks fan i mean i rooted for malik rose renaldo balkman mardy collins the corpses of penny hardaway eddy curry jalen rose landry fields marbury al harrington larry hughes even darko i know we wont win the chip anytime soon but just want an improved roster and exciting games to watch
nba,not_removed,and hes worth million this year equaling million years ago game has passed him by
nba,not_removed,bad signing for whoever signs dwight
nba,not_removed,hes not great hesokay and i think million is probably what he should get paid
nba,not_removed,not really noah is fine at million if hes your missing piece you can stomach the real problem is that knicks fans are severely overrating rose
nba,not_removed,yeah buts its not like hes going to be playing big minutes behind porzingus i kinda see it as a great fit for their team
nba,not_removed,rose dunked last season once wasnt a home game and happened in the latter part of the season but i dont remember against which team
nba,not_removed,he grew up in nyc
nba,not_removed,amare was really good that first year
nba,not_removed,yep that guy is the shiiiiiit
nba,not_removed,who is xpac
nba,not_removed,not comparable with the new cap
nba,not_removed,i love your like internet font
nba,not_removed,let me second that lol
nba,not_removed,even that is an overpay
nba,not_removed,bulls didnt have melo though
nba,not_removed,noah is mediocre
nba,not_removed,i would be pretty surprised if ezeli got million
nba,not_removed,could only hope implying there is even a chance hahaha
nba,not_removed,shits crazy whereas in the nhl a superstar will get money that bench nba players get
nba,not_removed,hes also declined way more than dwight from a lower peak noah can still defend and rebound but he cant do anything but pass on offense anymore cant shoot jumpers or free throws last year at the line cant make layups that doesnt even get into the fact that the injury issues arent a recent thing the guy averages almost dnps per season on his career for that is bad no matter what but it falls right in line with a the rose trade buy a player and pray he can recover some old glory b jacksons obsession with restoring the triangle as a respected offense noahs passing ability hypothetically makes him a strong triangle fit come to think of it i wouldnt be surprised if jackson viewed the rose trade as a way of wooing noah pretty dumb to worry about fit when you are so short on talent though also pretty dumb to sign agingdeclining players when youre a bad team at best they payoff for a year or two and then become burdens if you just won and made it the conference finals maybe you justify that risk kinda like how the knicks traded for bargnani on the same sort of gamble after winning but for a win team its a pretty curious choice
nba,not_removed,if i have melo and drose i would want noah instead of dwight dwight is the better player but he seems to me like a risk for the locker room noah is a real teamplayer and wont bitch about getting touches from melo or rose of course all this implicates that noah will be somewhat healthy next season
nba,not_removed,i do hope the crazy contracts are a thing of the past for us
nba,not_removed,would be a steal if noah is getting
nba,not_removed,i understand the hesitation but you need context he was coming off a knee injury when they brought in pau he was starting with pau and defending pfs and covering up for pau defensively pau is not a good defensive player no matter what some stupid advanced stats say he is not noah had a huge defensive responsibility while being slowed down by injury and having his role diminished then this past season saw a healtheier noah regaining his form but being relegated to the bench and having his role further diminished from what it used to be and what he thrived in seasons ago he was actually playing right before his freak shoulder injury he is is technically injury prone now but with context i dont see it as that much of a stretch that he would provide any team with a lot hes not only a great defender hes an intelligent player that could do a little bit of everything on the court he is the ultimate team guy and can be huge for team morale i think bringing him in with derrick will be great since they are close and know each others games well
nba,not_removed,not sure why anyone would think dwight is some scrub all of a sudden he did decline a bit but i would argue he would have a better impact on a different team that would utilize him still a extremely solid center that any team would want
nba,not_removed,no one is giving pau big money
nba,not_removed,thats my motto anyways
nba,not_removed,the knicks won the season series against the bulls last season
nba,not_removed,years too late
nba,not_removed,another year another i hope rose comes back to wreck dudes
nba,not_removed,that was my first thought this roster would be amazing in except for the fact that porzingis would be years old
nba,not_removed,haha yep or the monkey fist
nba,not_removed,thats not entirely accurate rose only has year left and i hope that pj doesnt give noah more than years
nba,not_removed,drose is a free agent at then end of so his million doesnt really matter and with the cap exploding again next summer mill for noah wouldnt be awful either it still would be an overpay but not horrible
nba,not_removed,the knicks wouldnt be signing noah to score theyre signing him to play good defense rebound and pass and play about mpg
nba,not_removed,hoiberg used him as scraps and not how noah is usually used im guessing he will be averaging points rebounds and assists if used well mil is like mil years ago so its an ok deal
nba,not_removed,our brain trust will probably offer jimmy for rose and noah
nba,not_removed,derrick is an actual moron im going to miss him but he was always all athleticism and no smarts even his basketball iq is questionable he jumps to throw passes all the fucking time and his injuries are as much of a result him putting his body on the line when he didnt need to as much as anything else on the other hand jay cutler is actually pretty fucking smart and half of the fans hate him so maybe derrick has it all figured out
nba,not_removed,phil is following the doc plan sign guys who beat up on you years prior
nba,not_removed,antonio mcdyessamare stoudamire steve francis vin baker penny hardaway and on and on
nba,not_removed,i think hes completely done as a starter maybe hes had a great recovery and can play again but is stupid if its for more than year
nba,not_removed,im not scared about that lil b blessed the knicks so well be good
nba,not_removed,o boy lol
nba,not_removed,see you in the finals
nba,not_removed,if the is a team option im down i like noah is steep but its all fake money if we can maintain flexibility
nba,not_removed,theyre hoping he gets back to form its definitely unlikely but if he can get even of that version of himself who finished in mvp voting then it still probably isnt worth mill but at least hell be pretty good and hes a better fit with ball dominant guys like rosemelo than dwight wouldve been imo
nba,not_removed,they see a passing big man that can actually play in the triangle with defense and can shoot above from the line plus he has familiarity with rose if he sucks he sucks if he regains his dpoy form hes worth much more than per year is like with the old cap so this isnt that ridiculous if you think this is ridiculous wait until dudes like kent bazemore are making
nba,not_removed,not all players need to score to be of high value
nba,not_removed,honestly its one big thing if hes on the court hes the best at stopping pnr and he gets rebounds a game thats it guarding pnr can get you mil rosemeloproz those guys will do the scoring
nba,not_removed,he cant even score i really dont know what these team are seeing more than you can comprehend do you people on reddit really think they know more about basketball and scouting than people like phil jackson and other execs its ridiculous
nba,not_removed,httpimgurcomlgswkjh
nba,not_removed,phil must have some sort of zen blood ritual hes gonna use to transfer kps youth to rose melo and noah
nba,not_removed,thats a pretty safe gamble
nba,not_removed,hey as mentioned on our sub it was reported that afflalo was going to sign at about mill but he ended up at lets just wait and see what we offer him
nba,not_removed,give me a ham sandwich instead of calderon
nba,not_removed,only good if that second year is a team option player option has the risk of the knicks being stuck with an injureddone noah in
nba,not_removed,they didnt trade lopez for noah they traded lopez to get rose then they got noah to replace lopez
nba,not_removed,i bet a lot of this has to do w his attitude and the hype he brings the team with best wishes from the their most recent signing drose honestly nyc is an epicenter like los angeles is except los angeles has the hype even when they sucked like this year people wanna be play for them nyc commands that same respect but they dont have anyone hyping that team up i think noah is a great pick up its like our rockets getting jason terry dudes a champ vet i know for a fact he changed that locker room for the better when it couldve been shittier
nba,not_removed,amen
nba,not_removed,damn for mil ill be an emotional leader and enforcer for them
nba,not_removed,seriously its not like they need shottakersmakers hes an awesome complimentary player and they will only be paying him while kp is on his rookie deal idk what system hornacek will run but he would have been a phenomenal fit on a phil jackson coached team the big concern is his health but its not like he added many minutes last year its his knees that debilitated him the past but last season he missed most of the season with a shoulder injury hopefully his legs got time to recharge and he will be able to bounce back i definitely wouldnt sign him without completing a thorough physical also optimistically you can chalk up a lot of his struggles to having to share the court with pau then being relegated to a minor role under hoiberg he would have a pretty clear role in new york and probably a fresh startconfidence boost just like rose that could get him mentally in shape to ball out its obviously an overpay but im not sure what other moves the knicks can realistically make that are better at this point it helps their chances of making playoffs plus it gives a great teammate to help kps development i think theres more upside there than signing mozgov theres going to be some crazy deals this summer
nba,not_removed,at of new cap id rather not have a cheerleader and sign someone like biyombo who would actually play majority of the games and bring the same things minus the emotional part
nba,not_removed,chandler was also a former dpoy that they overpayed and his last season was a disaster in ny too
nba,not_removed,mahinmi better guard signings noah and worse guard signings
nba,not_removed,bismack biyombo
nba,not_removed,cole aldrich
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,with these signings knicks fo thinking going to be insane
nba,not_removed,yep you can find bottom tier guys at the end of free agency who give you the same thing only younger and much much cheaper
nba,not_removed,that number is probably what he should be getting payed imo well see i guess
nba,not_removed,somebody send phil jackson some clips of noah getting man handled by james jones in the ecf semis he has been trash since that meniscus surgery after he won dpoy
nba,not_removed,for their sake hopefully
nba,not_removed,that first year
nba,not_removed,i have no idea why it posted like that but i like it too
nba,not_removed,its just the final closing of a window for a lot of bulls fans joakim was a key part of the group that really lifted the bulls in the postjordan era
nba,not_removed,last years sure
nba,not_removed,worse
nba,not_removed,i wont be the contracts this summer are going to be bonkers as a reminder there is over billion dollars in combined cap space and that was a calculation before the cap projection went from to every single signing report post on reddit will have a top comment that says holy shit they paid for is crazy or a grandpa thon meme
nba,not_removed,i dont wanna lose him but i do feel that theres gonna be a team out there willing to give him a big contract the front office wont be able to afford him then
nba,not_removed,the nhl need to make makes nba money
nba,not_removed,the free throw thing is kinda unfair — he only shot free throw last year because he was constantly injured and not playing i mean thats obviously an issue in and of itself but i dont think his ft last year when hes a career guy is really a reason to avoid him
nba,not_removed,i still have hopes noah can put together another good year or two his athleticism was back last year he just couldnt get in rhythm that said nobody should bet more than a year on him even with the new cap hes too much of a question mark and too injury prone
nba,not_removed,its a pretty curious choice indeedbut i will defer to phil jacksons decision making and basketball expertise you just dont accidentally win rings
nba,not_removed,so pretty much bogut
nba,not_removed,im not necessarily disagreeing and i can never know what some nbas will do but noah is also a hard worker and and good teammate dwight is fucking asshole and and hurts team chemistry wherever he goes demands to be in the spotlight and refuses to play to his strengths dwight also wants a long contract despite his age does that ruin his value of course not but it has to account for something
nba,not_removed,love the guy but he couldnt make layups last year
nba,not_removed,he was starting with pau and defending pfs and covering up for pau defensively which is something he wont have to do as often since kp was a surprisingly strong defender last season
nba,not_removed,bingo like shit
nba,not_removed,preach
nba,not_removed,doesnt work so well on tshirts but at least its specific i like that
nba,not_removed,fuck taj gibson
nba,not_removed,we just want to see d rose take flight again
nba,not_removed,the rams are gonna be spooky next year
nba,not_removed,after surviving a season without knee injury all aboard the hype train
nba,not_removed,thon maker wouldve been
nba,not_removed,and yet this is largely the same roster that people were saying and are still saying melo was stupid to turn down
nba,not_removed,so wait if you dont want rose beyond this season and dont want to max him out next offseason you traded a younger healther cheaper version of noah roloonly to sign noah for i dont get it
nba,not_removed,i dont want him long term two years at most but mil is going to be about of the cap next season if he can be our starting center and play the lopez role defending in space of the cap isnt much anything on offense is a bonus
nba,not_removed,but noahs problem this year was that he couldnt score and defenses defended him like tony allen just straight ignored him and devoted bodies elsewhere on the floor wrecking our offense thats the danger
nba,not_removed,aka robin lopez xx
nba,not_removed,to be honest im gonna be pretty upset if he only gets rebounds a game and doesnt outrebound lopez
nba,not_removed,listening to some of his interviews i couldnt help but laugh god bless that man but he is not the sharpest tool in the shed not trying to be mean just always thought this as well
nba,not_removed,amare was a monster when he went to ny
nba,not_removed,technically only amare was signed the rest of them we traded for silly things like future first round picks and young prospects with potential who needs that anyways
nba,not_removed,dont forget jason kidd rasheed wallace tracy mcgrady
nba,not_removed,marbury
nba,not_removed,tracy mcgrady glen rice jason kidd
nba,not_removed,tmac
nba,not_removed,didnt know lil b blessed them ignore my comment then tybg
nba,not_removed,he blessed us tokings v knicks finals
nba,not_removed,of prime noah is definitely worth mill in this new league
nba,not_removed,i recall him finishing but looking at his numbers obviously do not tell the story why so um why did he finish
nba,not_removed,im not a knicks fan so im probably out of the loop but i thought they were going away from the triangle because they signed hornacek and traded for rose
nba,not_removed,yeah i mean how dare people doubt decisions from a team that ranked dead last on front office polls and have a history of terrible decision making am i right
nba,not_removed,great point vlade
nba,not_removed,the gamble is the injuries role players for injuryprone allstars
nba,not_removed,not given the trajectory of rose and noahs playing careers rose getting better is risky but its an educated calculated risk i dont know what they could know that makes them think noah is just in a slump and not a decline also who the fuck else is offering noah anything near i think the knicks are bidding against themselves here or noah has the best agent on the planet
nba,not_removed,i wouldnt be so sure about that with how rose and noahs careers have gone theres a good chance robin lopez will be a better player than both of them going forward
nba,not_removed,id definitely take calderons jamon iberico hookup over calderon himself
nba,not_removed,too bad you only have of them
nba,not_removed,okay or you keep lopez at his now team friendly contract and sign a point guard from the free agent crop instead of the post mortem derrick rose
nba,not_removed,ill do it for like and free food from the concession stands
nba,not_removed,and minus the passing offense and free throw shooting
nba,not_removed,fuck this recency bias biyombo has played mediocre all his career until he was put into an actually decent system noah has shown he can produce when the game plan is shaped around him yet no one will give him any consideration because hes on the decline noah has not played center or rim protector on the bulls in the last two years theres no reason to assume his numbers wont go up with higher usage rates more minutes biyombo has produced for part of a playoff run
nba,not_removed,if its like years per thats not really too bad you get an emotional leader who has played with rose his entire career its probably techinically a bad deal but there is going to be soooooo much money floating around these next seasons guys are gonna get overpaid if you can overpay on only a year deal for a veteran leader it could be a lot worse plus noahs injury last year was his shoulder not his legs so thats at least something if he can miraculously be healthy he is an ideal fit at center in the triangle as he is still an elite passer for the position
nba,not_removed,dude had like one good playoff performance i think noah is a more valuable player in terms of what a player brings to the table
nba,not_removed,i think the idea is for him to have a boguttype role passing screening ball movement and ease porzingis transition to center if his free throws come back likely or his midrange game ehhh not so likely thats a bonus like others have said i dont know why nyk went through all that chicanery when they could have just kept lopez and signed anyone of the many point guards who have outplayed rose over the past three seasons but knicks
nba,not_removed,what if i told you phil jackson knows more about whats best for the knicks than you do
nba,not_removed,bismack is so overrated after the playoffs and is getting the max ill take the veteran leadership hustle and play making of noah any day for a similar price
nba,not_removed,false check his per last year mind you he played alongside gasol
nba,not_removed,can the teams combine to make javale mcgee the first nba salary billionaire
nba,not_removed,idk ezeli sucked it up in the playoffs
nba,not_removed,he hasnt even played more than games the last two years i feel like thats gonna hurt em
nba,not_removed,thats fine if its a short term deal but i think a lot of teams will wait to use their space in the following years signing a guy to a year deal will affect cap space not just for next year
nba,not_removed,whats the cap floor under the new arrangement seems like the floor for the season will be higher than the ceiling was just a few years ago
nba,not_removed,youd have to be very myopic to not anticipate for the future in max contracts but yet someone will get caught with their hand in the cookie jar and get fired for fucking over their team
nba,not_removed,losing a player like efestus affects the team during the season sure but how effective was he during the playoffs
nba,not_removed,yeah id find it more problematic that the knicks fo is going to give mil a year to a guy that started two games last year i think id pass on that
nba,not_removed,pfff a frontline with melo zingis and bogut would be so good though
nba,not_removed,specific enough to apply to every facet of everyday life
nba,not_removed,wait why
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,seriously that mvp year was magical the way he could weave through traffic and change speed and direction also that vertical leap god i wish i could see that again
nba,not_removed,wreck dudes
nba,not_removed,death taxes the spurs d rose motivational youtube video
nba,not_removed,i just dont wanna see him land
nba,not_removed,its over man hes never coming back
nba,not_removed,enough already
nba,not_removed,two years is a long time when nba primes only average about years
nba,not_removed,the year on rose is just flexibility in case things dont pan out injury or otherwise next years fa crop has a good mix of goodgreatallstar pgs so if the rose experiment fails we can go after another one if the rose experiment is good then yay for us we got his bird rights and have our future pg another thing that isnt mentioned as often is that we actually have our round pick next year so a failure in the experiment comes with a silver lining as for trading lopezi think we as knicks fans overvalue him hes good defensively and is efficient offensively hes also as you said younger healthier and cheaper if the is true but he is not a version of noah what i mean by that is lopez cannot offer everything that noah does lopez cannot play to the standards of a dpoy he doesnt have the vision noah has and he definitely cannot pass like noah simply put noahs best is much better than lopezs best of course the argument is that noah needs to stay on the court for all this to matter but i just wanted to point out that i dont think comparing them as similar players is fair because while rolo is a younger healthier cheaper version hes also potentially a much worse version
nba,not_removed,you traded a younger healther cheaper version of noah rolo lets settle down here for a second the bulls ran their entire offense through noah a couple of seasons ago and he finished in mvp voting that year rolo wouldnt have a shit show of doing that
nba,not_removed,knicks things my friend you get use to it
nba,not_removed,people are ignoring how far noahs game has fallen in the past years
nba,not_removed,ive got to say im not one bit happy about joakim noah especially at that price
nba,not_removed,tbh lopez was looking damn good towards the end of the season
nba,not_removed,according to that comparison we still have a guy like lopez but have d rose instead of jose calderon not bad huh
nba,not_removed,i remember he had an appearance at a park on the south side sponsored by powerade since powerade signed him this was relatively early in his career like year or and in his little pep talk he said something to the effect of go to school dont forget to eat right get your wheaties and gatorade and the powerade people just facepalmed so hard
nba,not_removed,for half a season
nba,not_removed,he only said hed lift the kd curse if he went there i thought so anyway
nba,not_removed,all you gotta do is pop in how to lose a guy in days
nba,not_removed,the kings franchise did bring the first championship to new york
nba,not_removed,yeah its hard to judge before seeing everyones market idk if hell be able to do it with all his injuries anyway i just think that dwight would be a disaster in ny and theyre better off with noah dwights a bettter player but with rosemelo needing all the touches plus they even wanna get porzingis involved i cant imagine dwight thriving or enjoyimg playing next to them also if hornacek wants to play fast thats not for dwight i kinda like the noah gamble not for that price but still because at least you know hes gonna work his ass off and hell be good for the chemistry hes friends with melo and obviously great relationship with drose too
nba,not_removed,i always point to this game as an example of what he brought to the table obviously this game isnt what he put up every game but damn that tenacity when derrick was out for that whole season everyone counted them out noah was the reason they finished as high as they did he also averaged more assists than any center and basically played point center with that type of energy every game
nba,not_removed,the bulls were injured as fuck as noah completely took over the team he became the point centre and pretty much carried the bulls to a good playoff position after the allstar break he was a walking triple double machine
nba,not_removed,it was
nba,not_removed,hes also shoots above for his career and for years pretty much shot every year the last two years could be just as much an aberration as a trend
nba,not_removed,lol
nba,not_removed,the triangle is just a set to play into the offense runs around the talents of the roster things will obviously change when you factor in the strengths of rose and whoever else comes in
nba,not_removed,i meanunder phil that has absolutely not been the case so yeah that would be pretty dumb
nba,not_removed,youre right but i cant help but chuckle at the idea of jose as a role player every team needs a good turnstile
nba,not_removed,this guy knows
nba,not_removed,the point guard crop is weak this year if you miss out on maxing mike conley youre stuck with jeremy lin on a long term deal we got a one year rental for rose so if he doesnt work out we have max money in a year with plenty of great point guards
nba,not_removed,implying that you would consume less than worth of concessions if i were the knicks id give you and unload a couple first rounders
nba,not_removed,noahs free throw shooting has declined and his offense has been non existent the last couple years coming off a shoulder injury the dude will not be that good
nba,not_removed,passing offense and free throw shooting minus the passing you mean biyombo has been much better on offense than noah recently and noah was even worse at freethrow shooting last year
nba,not_removed,noah isnt going to touch the ball anyway with rose and melo on the team edit you do have me here on free throw shooting thats a downside
nba,not_removed,minus the offense lol
nba,not_removed,offence the guy struggles to make layups pitching noah on his offense is pretty used car salesman at this point
nba,not_removed,last time i watched noah couldnt hit a wide open layup biyombo has a higher ceiling and a higher floor by a factor of ten on both counts
nba,not_removed,i honestly think biyombo might be a better offensive player in than noah given noah just shot from the field bismack may not bring a lot of skills to the table and noah is still a gifted passer but how effectively can you run offense through a player who can be given the bogutonallen treatment in regards to scoring
nba,not_removed,biyombo is only and is likely going to continue improving while noahs best years are more than likely behind him
nba,not_removed,biyombo started playing basketball five years ago its reasonable to expect him to truly improve year by year
nba,not_removed,biyombo played excellent during the regular season when jv was out
nba,not_removed,his ft numbers are down and he was kind of slow last season both of these can be fixed in an offseason on the other hand noah can be the anchor of a teamdefense and at the same time he can play pointcenter when needed he is unique and if ny decide to actually utilize him the fit is great
nba,not_removed,theyll all pay him not to play
nba,not_removed,greg ostertag made like mil being the center for the jazzhow did that happen shag says everybody was having too much fun watching him get dunked on by shaq so they just brought him back each year even the jazz fans liked it
nba,not_removed,the floor will be million which is million more than the current cap and actually more than the current luxury tax
nba,not_removed,i beleive its mill
nba,not_removed,yes exactly that specific
nba,not_removed,he was calling teams like the knicks trash during the season despite the bulls losing to teams like the knicks toward the end of the season
nba,not_removed,dont make me cry man
nba,not_removed,he was my favorite player to watch of all time
nba,not_removed,im a knicks fan would love to see that happen but your best bet is probably youtube at this point i dont see it happening
nba,not_removed,never
nba,not_removed,and miss out on that sweet sweet karma
nba,not_removed,two years ago drose and butler were worse
nba,not_removed,honestly i fear for you if rose plays really well this year i would not want to be in the position of having to consider offering him mil per year
nba,not_removed,eh noah is on the decline and rolo is not id be surprised if noah was better than him next year to be honest i have no reason to believe he can get back to the way he was unlike rose whos young and still very good when he plays
nba,not_removed,so what do you think they are expectinghoping for rose as far as production how would they measure if the experiment was a success overall record ppgapg games played etc
nba,not_removed,you said a couple of seasons ago knicks in summer two years ago there was a chance derrick rose might get close to his old self again also two years ago joakim noah was good we should bring them in knicks in summer two years ago bargnani averaged pointsgame we should get him knicks in spring two years from now if we keep rebuilding we might have enough pieces to trade for melo and give him the support to make a deep playoff run lets trade for him now knicks in summer two years ago amare might have been young enough that we could count on him staying healthy for most of a five year contract lets offer those uninsurable knees a max contract knicks in winter two years ago steve francis was still a good player time to trade for him knicks in fall two years ago eddy curry led the league in fg and there was a good chance hed have a stellar career lets trade for him knicks in winter two years ago before the netssuns swap of kidd and marbury proved how empty a player marbury was it might have made sense to trade for marbury lets get him now knicks in summer two years ago before major knee surgery antonio mcdyess was one of hte best power forwards in the game lets trade for him knicks in summer two years ago we had a good team and didnt need to rebuild now that we do lets sign year old allan houston to a long term max contract knicks in fall two years ago patrick ewing was already well past his prime lets trade him for players on longer contracts who werent past their prime two years ago but are now cablevision in summer two years ago the knicks won games how badly can the idiot son of our founder james dolan fuck things up lets give him control over the team timing is everything right
nba,not_removed,noah also cannot make a layup to save his life anymore and has been injured quite a bit his decline was super hard and fast
nba,not_removed,i wouldnt be either its dangerous to hand out those kind of contracts can set a franchise and a player back years look at new orleans theyve sacrificed an extremely valuable chunk of anthony davis years due to poor management
nba,not_removed,assuming d rose is healthy but even if we started air out there it would be better then calderon
nba,not_removed,cringe ouch man
nba,not_removed,then mike dantoni ran his knees into the ground
nba,not_removed,he also said the knicks were blessed and that they would progress this year it was later on he added the kd part
nba,not_removed,exactly lmao
nba,not_removed,i dont get it
nba,not_removed,my bad haha just thinking of kerrs tweet from that was recently posted here when he said hed take noah in a game over anyone but lebronkd thats why i thought
nba,not_removed,honestly i think jo just lost his mojo lol even when he seemed healthy last year he just seemed off on offense also i cant think of another reason or even another example of a player dropping their free throw rate percent over the course of onetwo seasons hopefully hell find his touch and be productive for the next years
nba,not_removed,or it is just him getting older
nba,not_removed,a turnstile lol thats a good one
nba,not_removed,jeremy lins been a better player than rose the last two years or so
nba,not_removed,good point but i would imagine in the triangle offense nyk want somebody in the paint who can pass
nba,not_removed,it would be stupid to sign noah and not use one of his best weapons and its his passing for a big man even with rose and melo to win you gotta move the ball i could see a lot of giving it to noah on the top while melo and rose cut and move without the ball
nba,not_removed,thats not how the triangle works noaj will likely be getting plenty of touches to pass out of the post
nba,not_removed,thats why they need a really good offensive rebounderhigh energy guy biyombo i dont think noah has the athleticism to make it worth it
nba,not_removed,the probability of event a
nba,not_removed,straight from the josh smith handbook
nba,not_removed,thats pretty dumb tag sucked massively on offense but he was one of the better defenders shaq faced in his career dude had a big enough body not to be completely bullied down low we brought him back because he made dudes like shaq work hard for their points i guess maybe shaq just repressed the wcf sweep if ostertag was so bad shaq should have carried the lakers to at least win right edit ps mil isnt very much money for playing years with the organization being an adequate footer is going to get you paid in the nba
nba,not_removed,but that was his point you guys had a very poor record but we were still losing to you meaning that we were even worse off even though our season record didnt show it edit for some reason i thought you were a knicks fan sorry for saying you
nba,not_removed,thats why we love taj
nba,not_removed,hold me brother
nba,not_removed,i think we go for westbrook no matter what
nba,not_removed,i watch games with jose calderon on the court i would be okay if rose played on crutches
nba,not_removed,this comment was an absolute murder my god the knicks really fuck up a lot crazy seeing it spelled out like this
nba,not_removed,i was reading on for more about keith van horn for spree or signing weatherspoon or andersoneisley deal
nba,not_removed,why do you have to absolutely devastate the hopes and dreams of us knicks fans
nba,not_removed,lets offer those uninsurable knees a max contract it was actually the back that killed amare
nba,not_removed,this is amazing knicks in a nutshell
nba,not_removed,lol savage i keep scrolling down and it keeps getting better 😂😂
nba,not_removed,jesus christ man he has a family
nba,not_removed,i think im going to give this man gold
nba,not_removed,i was comparing rolos potential career path projection against noahs past seasons it wasnt a comparison of noah now vs rolo now also i dont really see how the knicks fo being incompetent is my fault but ok
nba,not_removed,savage
nba,not_removed,yes this is unthinkable but it happened you can only be so bad on offense before you tank the team there and become unplayable noahs gotta bounce back in a big way to be an impactful player again
nba,not_removed,exactly its a risk but a good risk calderon made our offense and defense insufferable unfortunately
nba,not_removed,oh awesome well forgive me based god
nba,not_removed,but even the year before this year noah couldnt make a layup to save his life for some reason i cant find it anywhere but in last years playoffs against the bucks i can remember vividly that one missed layup with nobody around they even showed pip about to get and clap but then he instantly facepalmed when he missed i remember myself being shocked at first but at the same time i kind of expected nothing less because that was all he was doing all season missing layups
nba,not_removed,scenery change can get that mojo back its been done for a lot of players and jo is a guy who feeds off the crowd ny will love him hes going to instantly turn into a fan favorite because of his heart and hussel and thatll in turn feed those aspects of his game i dont think hes going to be jo but hes going to at least be as good as rollo and probably better suited for the system with his passing and based on the reaction of a lot of fans because of his recent performance theyd happily have rollo for new cap means new numbers but same value
nba,not_removed,i dont think ive ever seen a player played more than joakim bulls ran him so much he was in the top mpg for a few years back to back iirc i hope it hasnt caught up with him
nba,not_removed,yes but is he good enough to be worth signing on a longterm deal as opposed to a oneyear flier on rose
nba,not_removed,same with rondo and hed be a lot cheaper
nba,not_removed,are they still running the triangle with hornacek on board
nba,not_removed,the problem is teams already know they dont have to guard noah on the perimeter
nba,not_removed,dude had to guard hakeem olajuwon david robinson tim duncan and shaquille oneal in those back to back playoff runs and did it better than almost anyone
nba,not_removed,very true you cant teach people how to be tall
nba,not_removed,it was just for fun mil in the dudebanking i am a huge greg ostertag fan seeing as i am a jayhawk but shaq always made fun of greg ostertag like that and it was funny
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,eh it all comes down to dolan and im sure you could do this for most teams
nba,not_removed,not your fault just venting sorry if it came off as directed at you as opposed to just riffing off your comment
nba,not_removed,are you dolan if not its not your fault dude if so imma beat yo ass and take all yo money
nba,not_removed,dude i remember that awful moment i was with my girlfriend in her college cafeteria i get hyped anytime noah scores i yell and get pissed when he fucking misses all these rich chicagoland kids turn around and my girlfriend is pissed because im yelling curse words i never liked going back after that thanks a lot jo
nba,not_removed,no no he is not its better to see what you can get from rose after he had a fairly strong finish to last year and try again for a point guard next summer
nba,not_removed,yes he is
nba,not_removed,yes
nba,not_removed,the big man wouldnt be on the perimeter in the triangle
nba,not_removed,what center do you have to go out to the perimeter for not dj not dwight not bogut not cousins not adams etc teams dont need a center who can shoot to win games
nba,not_removed,just made me watch a greg ostertag highlight video on youtube
nba,not_removed,even if theyre soft
nba,not_removed,can confirm bargnani never knew how to be tall
nba,not_removed,dont get me wrong knicks have been awful in decision making in the past but hindsight is most definitely especially on this sub however since phil jackson came the knicks have not made any of the types of mistakes listed above mainly because dolan has been nowhere to be found so ill defer to his judgement when it comes to evaluating and signing players
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,no worries
nba,not_removed,it wasnt a strong finish
nba,not_removed,greg ostertag highlight video on youtube its like the rule of basketball that everyone has a highlight video on youtube

nba,not_removed,i dont know that its a smile but i think when russ is focused his face goes straight to this competitive grin where hes staring his defender in the eyes
nba,not_removed,carmelo the smile anthony
nba,not_removed,westbrook his aggression is so much fun especially when he jams it into the hoop on a dunk
nba,not_removed,easy perkins 😁
nba,not_removed,this guy

nba,not_removed,i swear it never stops smiling
nba,not_removed,

nba,not_removed,some reason read this as derrick rose jr instantly thought baby rose used the ocarina of time
nba,not_removed,yay
nba,not_removed,whistles smiles today was a good day
nba,not_removed,kind of feels like every team except for the warriors sucks just a little bit
nba,not_removed,thats gonna shaken the standings up a bit more
nba,not_removed,my wife not a sports fan just said maybe it is a space jam thingy space jam confirmed that means that the monstars will possibly possess the talents of chris paul james harden kawai leonard lebron james deandre jordan andor maybe deangelo russel kemba walker
nba,not_removed,i know the utah win was technically an upset but utah absolutely shut down harden and dropped points on a
nba,not_removed,do not underestimate us we doing damage
nba,not_removed,just want to remind all those higher ranked teams that its still pretty early in the season wont be too hard to tank for a pick and look forward s
nba,not_removed,not having a game scheduled for todayjust another example of the warriors being light years ahead of the competition tbh
nba,not_removed,hoorayyy
nba,not_removed,magic fans on cloud right now lol
nba,not_removed,everyone has their games lol edit jesus i cant type
nba,not_removed,pssh standings only matter in november when your team wins if they lose you convince yourself its too early to care
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,seriously man you dont even know
nba,not_removed,damn thats getting kinda real
nba,not_removed,amen
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,rip chicago
nba,not_removed,a year everyone getting paid this offseason huh
nba,not_removed,someone tell me if we overpaid
nba,not_removed,i hate to tell you but yes for this version of joakim isnot ideal
nba,not_removed,i would bet my life savings that if it was lebron with points and fouls in the fourth quarter no fucking way a ref makes that same call
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,curry makes and everybody goes crazy dmc makes and nobody cares smh
nba,not_removed,please boogie just fucking stop man
nba,not_removed,tbh if your on fouls you should never swipe someone on the fastbreak
nba,not_removed,lebron wouldnt go for that steal tho
nba,not_removed,its one of those plays that isnt called if there isnt a turnover but is definitely a foul
nba,not_removed,please no i beg that he leaves sacramento and actually make the playoffs and maybe win a ring eventually in his career as much as i want him to be a sacramento legend i want him to be an nba legend more
nba,not_removed,we get a lot of those
nba,not_removed,is it weird that i enjoy watching your kings more than i enjoy watching the pelicans
nba,not_removed,yes because you guys have a good roster also was just checking the pellies roster and why is reke playing so little how is hield developing
nba,not_removed,we do i find the lack of talent weve surround ad with depressing tyreke is only a month or so removed from having not played for pretty much all of and hes probably best suited for a man bench scoring type role anyway hield can shoot but thats pretty much it his shots either fall or they dont i dont expect him to develop into much more than that
nba,not_removed,reke is basketball cancer he just doesnt help you win imo
nba,not_removed,you dont
nba,not_removed,i think at the moment your situation is better than the kings
nba,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvaqnkeugaamc
nba,not_removed,ian eagle with some brilliant commentary at around
nba,not_removed,toko shengelia with one of the greatest high fives of our generation
nba,not_removed,itll be interesting to see what his role is with utah he wont be starting but i wouldnt be surprised if hes finishing close games
nba,not_removed,i like ian but hes somewhat tarnished by the fact that i hate dan fouts commentary in football and theyve been paired for years gives me bad flashbacks
nba,not_removed,back when joe johnson was the clutchest player of all time or so it felt like hes still up there
nba,not_removed,god she was such a fox in those episodes
nba,not_removed,excuse me i thought it was obvious
nba,not_removed,because he has a losing finals record
nba,not_removed,it also helps too when the second best player in the east is jimmy freaking butler
nba,not_removed,who
nba,not_removed,who is this lebron guy and why havent i ever heard of him
nba,not_removed,nobody brings it up is quite an exaggeration
nba,not_removed,im pretty sure we have already wellestablished how good lebron is during the postseason
nba,not_removed,he has been dominating the east not the finals
nba,not_removed,lebron james what a silly name this guy will never amount to anything
nba,not_removed,he might even be better than the great jason terry the man so good that with paul pierce and kevin garnett he was worth top picks
nba,not_removed,its like this guy never heard of sean kilpatrick
nba,not_removed,you mean god
nba,not_removed,i think the reason andre drummond is so underrated is because people dont watch the games and see just how much pressure he creates by just rebounding teams dont play in the full court against us because theres always three guys trying to box out drummond running a pick and roll with drummond is an easy way to get an open look because theres no way only one defender can contain him his presence creates a lot that does not show up in the stats sheet
nba,not_removed,this was drummonds second consecutive game with boards game of his career final stats tonight points rebounds blocks steals and an assist hes on his way to a huge season one of the more underrated stars in the league
nba,not_removed,almost any other day this wouldve been the standout individual performance of the day hi there russ
nba,not_removed,has anyone else done this in the last few years
nba,not_removed,yeah ive noticed eye test that we dont really give up fast break points but we score a lot on the break even though drummond crashes the offensive glass
nba,not_removed,probably stems from the fact that people dont watch him and understand how he plays they look at rim protection stats and see hes just an average rim protector without realizing that he is out too covering pick and rolls like few big men in the league can and this makes it harder to rotate back and protect the rim he is literally one of and maybe will go down as the greatest rebounder ever percentage wise and while this is known i still feel its overlooked just how great of a rebounder he is and then people say he has no offensive game which is absolutely wrong because most of his baskets this year he has created for himself he has made huge leaps with his ball handling and post game the last two years hes like the forgotten young star of the league hes carrying a hodge podge of role players to the playoffs on his back and being scrutinized because he cant make free throws when it doesnt really matter if you actually watch him play
nba,not_removed,hes the reverse mike conley last season he was overrated but now hes underrated
nba,not_removed,dre has done it like times
nba,not_removed,a game yea theres been a few
nba,not_removed,klove had a with the wolves and several more
nba,not_removed,exactly hes underrated on here because probably upwards of of the sub are box score warriors not that theres anything inherently wrong with stats and some of the advanced ones not trying to say ft is an advanced stat im starting to divert to a different but related point that applies to a lot more than just drummond we have at our disposal nowadays but way too many people on here either misunderstand howwhen to use them or overstate their importance its coming from a good place because tbh who wouldnt want to be able to cleanly understand the game through nothing but nice easy numbers but at the same time this aint baseball we need a lot more context in our analysis
nba,not_removed,right i hate hate hate that people will piss stats out of their asshole instead of watching someone play hes flat out dominating games but doe they need to trade him dont know if he can ever be a franchise player another thing caused by only watching highlights the misconception that all he does is dunk of course theyre gonna show reggies lobs to him but theyll sneak in that one high post drive even though he made the same play multiple times or has some non descript play where theres no guard to outlet to so hell just bring it up and try and cross his man hes a good ole rebounding paint dominating big man but i guess you can only be good if you shoot
nba,not_removed,doesnt really matter um what it matters quite a bit he is overcoming the main shortcoming in his game elsewhere but lets not act like being one of the worst ft shooters ever isnt a big deal he is failing to acquire points in historically the most efficient place to do so shaq was historically dominant had some of the best post moves ever and won titles he was still heavily and rightly criticized for not being able to shoot a ft by my definition he drummond isnt a superstar but im probably a little more strict than most
nba,not_removed,i never felt like dre was overrated last year personally he has some bad stretches but i still feel like he deserved all nba third team
nba,not_removed,ad did a game last year
nba,not_removed,another thing caused by only watching highlights the misconception that all he does is dunk people in other threads this week have said he hasnt improved his offense at all that is complete nonsense he has developed a back to the basket game and is fairly comfortable facing up with opposing centers as well svg and the coaching staff are forcing him to develop a real offensive game which resulted in his fg percentage dipping a bit
nba,not_removed,like i said people like you are the problem he is so fucking dominant that the fact he cant make free throws doesnt stop him from being a star because he can dominate a game offensively defensively and on the glass leaving a couple points at the free throw line hardly matters because he is such a net positive in every other facet of the game
nba,not_removed,i think the beginning of the year when he was absolutely dominating he might have been a bit overrated this year there is no doubt hes underrated
nba,not_removed,against drummond too
nba,not_removed,i had drummond on one of my all nba teams and someone goes i dont think hell have that good of a year weve seen the best from him lol dude is and has never not improved
nba,not_removed,never said he wasnt a star but he is leaving far more than a couple points at the line and do you have anything but anecdotal evidence that he is dominating on defense the only area hes really dominated in is rebounding which is admittedly a huge plus his post game has gotten better but isnt dominant his pnr game is pretty dominant but that always requires having the right teammates mainly for the big man i just dont think a team featuring drummond as their best player could win a championship at this point unless you get some pistons magic going again
nba,not_removed,yeah i feel you some people were happy to jump the gun last year with how he started the year i did it too
nba,not_removed,for his career he makes out of per game if he was a reasonable shooter for a center say hed be making so its less than a couple points he leaves at the line i think the fact that the pistons are so much better with him on he floor defensively should tell you a lot also despite being one of the smallest teams in the league they are the best at limiting shots in the paint
nba,not_removed,you have onoff numbers for me then still sounds anecdotal and how about we ignore his career and just look last season how many ftas and he is still leaving more than a couple points at the line regardless of how many hed get back for shooting
nba,not_removed,hes really not though there is no point in arguing you dont watch him play and you will pick one bad number of his to discredit him your opinion is not worth much
nba,not_removed,lol you could easily discredit me with some numbers to back up your point what are his onoff numbers what are his defensive efficiency numbers ive watched him play plenty and i dont think he is this defensive stalwart youre making him out to be he gets lost on pnrs sometimes he either makes the wrong read out fails to communicate he doesnt defend the rim that fantastically even when he is starting near the basket ive seen all of this you watch every game or close to it and youve probably had a tendency to filter out the bad stuff dont discredit me because i dont watch him discredit me with numbers or anything more than anecdotal evidence prove to me that he has the chops to lead a championship team and then ill admit hes a superstar sure he is a rising star with a lot of potential but there are several deficiencies in his game one of them glaring that are holding him back from that next level
nba,not_removed,i never said he was a superstar though
nba,not_removed,ok so he is pretty widely regarded as a rising star how does that make him underrated
nba,not_removed,because this offseason was all talk about how he is overrated most people dont consider him a star i saw lists without him as a top center the fact he led a team lacking on talent to wins is overlooked
nba,not_removed,ok ill give you that lists without him as a top ten center are a joke i havent really seen all this overrated talk but if its out there they are also wrong
nba,not_removed,yep you can attribute most of it to his hurt wrist most of it cant give a complete pass for some of the decisions he made
nba,not_removed,he should rest that hand before it gets any worse
nba,not_removed,its his wrist
nba,not_removed,he didnt need to take some of those shots against portland tonight weird
nba,not_removed,this is why players rest their games
nba,not_removed,dont overlook the meme potential of russell westbrook finishing the season with a better than james harden less than apart now
nba,not_removed,i get him wanting to play all after coming this far and how easily a few nights off the radar could hurt him in a close mvp race but this is definitely not the time to be letting anyone on the rockets play through injury its virtually impossible for them to end up anywhere other than the seed at this point making it a zero risk move that can only benefit them come playoff time
nba,not_removed,maybe a midrange might be a little more effective
nba,not_removed,hopefully he can get healthy in time for the playoffs
nba,not_removed,will games of rest really hurt his mvp chances you can see the injury is affecting his numbers and its only getting worse over time
nba,not_removed,nice sample size
nba,not_removed,while playing through a wrist injury
nba,not_removed,hes been playing through a wrist injury
nba,not_removed,gonna come back to fuck the rockets in the playoffs when harden wont rest his wrist
nba,not_removed,tired of this gimmick basketball unbelievable players that are so concerned about their stats will be rewarded
nba,not_removed,wow that is kobesque volume and roughly kobesque percentages too
nba,not_removed,
nba,not_removed,i think hes very concerned about winning the mvp and refuses to rest because of it
nba,not_removed,he probably has a multimillion bonus in his shoe contract if he wins mvp no way he rests with games left
nba,not_removed,he obviously doesnt care about the playoffs and just wants to win mvp cause he doesnt have to play through the injury its not good for his team what hes doing
nba,not_removed,ok not gonna lie harden is being very selfish foolish prideful and really just shortsighted if his wrist is hurting his shot this much and he refuses to sit out one game
nba,not_removed,its lil b
nba,not_removed,this is a bit different because hes injured he probably should rest not because hes overall worn out but because hes not allowing his shooting wrist to heal properly
nba,not_removed,ive already had so much fan when my friends call westbrook westbrick and i mention that hardens only shooting better
nba,not_removed,this is exactly it
nba,not_removed,im really not sure about that he just historically doesnt rest games that being said a perfect opportunity is coming up i dont know about the warriors game but play him very little for that and send him back to houston the two days we have between the suns and the nuggets is the most we get after that its vs nuggets day vs pistons day sacramentoclippers day and vs timberwolves we can give four days of rest while playing a winnable game against a tanking suns team since the thunder or pelicans game when we were made aware of the issue there hasnt bbeen a good stretch like that rest is also about timing
nba,not_removed,tbf his chances of winning a chip are incredibly low with gs in the mix while his chances to win mvp are still very good but i agree id rather him rest at least a couple games him being trash from will kill our playoff hopes
nba,not_removed,if westbrook did this same thing yall would be praising him for being a competitor and playing through pain for his team i know its different because we pretty much have the seed locked up but still he wants to be out there and show hes tough to show hes the mvp hes still averaging like points while being hurt right obviously he can still play hes just being a competitor man
nba,not_removed,selfish he literally said he wanted to be there for his team what do you mean selfish edit i realize what the other argument is about wanting mvp and i legit could not think of a reason so im just gonna concede on this one
nba,not_removed,why doesnt this apply to two point fg
nba,not_removed,but the higher your volume at that number the more likely your drops
nba,not_removed,damn who hurt you
nba,not_removed,which is disappointing because the last two playoffs have shown that injuries will take you out of a series
nba,not_removed,but wont this kinda production rather hurt his case for mvp
nba,not_removed,i dont get it though wb has played less games than harden already him sitting out a couple of games means he keeps his great stats im confused why sitting out games would hurt his mvp doesnt shooting with the bad wrist hurt it more lowering his averages abit
nba,not_removed,you gotta give your best shot its horrible when you get injured and you sit there with what could have been
nba,not_removed,i agree i like that shows his competitive nature definitely gained some respect for harden for playing
nba,not_removed,its not like thunder is still fighting for better seedings and rockets is basically locked in third
nba,not_removed,if westbrook did this same thing yall would be praising him for being a competitor and playing through pain for his team very much doubt that when wb was going off last game he missed shots in a row and people were already close to shit talking wb his own fans so if he got a hurt wrist and keeps missing thunder fans will shit super hard on him
nba,not_removed,he should be resting they cant catch the seed and its unlikely they fall to the seed so why does he insist on playing while injured
nba,not_removed,hes playing for an award hes hurting his team by playing on an injury
nba,not_removed,clearly his injured presence isnt helping the w column much right now anyway just take a game dude
nba,not_removed,hes selfish cause he doesnt concede the mvp award to kawhi
nba,not_removed,exactly its like saying otto porter is a better point shooter than steph because he has a higher percentage anyone who understands volume wouldnt think that
nba,not_removed,i agree but lets be real this is why i dont like the efficiency stats brought up against westbrook when you shoot that much your percentage is gonna drop a ton hes still keeping his fg close to harden think its within of each other thats an achievement in and of itself you dont just magically get points when you shoot a lot you have to be good enough to make those shots and fight through fatigue
nba,not_removed,recency bias wb just had killer performances im sure he doesnt want to sit after that
nba,not_removed,westbrook played less games because of the schedule or what i dont remember him missing a game
nba,not_removed,i already addressed that
nba,not_removed,you have a point
nba,not_removed,he also kinda trashed on lebron for resting games so it will make him look hypocritical now if he sits
nba,not_removed,very true
nba,not_removed,cause he wants mvp
nba,not_removed,to show some leadership
nba,not_removed,westbrook
nba,not_removed,lol i get the westbrookharden rnba beef but to act like theyre not is just fucking stupid
nba,not_removed,thats my bad someone had said that wb hasnt played every game googling it it seems both have been playing every game i myself thought he did miss atleast game though ill take the l on that one though
nba,not_removed,no it wont atleast in my eyes harden and beverly talked about healthy players missing games harden has hurt his wrist
nba,not_removed,obviously you cant blame him for wanting mvp but it wont be worth it if hes not for the playoffs
nba,not_removed,no i dont think so frye is a direct counter to gsw playing bogut festus varejao for prolonged minutes at the to help on lebrons drives all three of those guys do not like to leave the painted area and with lebron and kyries attacking the rim possibly drawing an extra defender it may allow for open shooting opportunities for frye the small ball lineup that i think the cavs will run against gsw will be kyrie smith shumpert lebron love gsw reverted back to letting draymond sit in the key in their small ball lineup while guarding a non scorer because he is a great rim defender the cavs must recognize that when this happens then they have to find the open guy and i think in most cases it will be love or shumpert neither love nor frye have the lateral quickness to guard guys on the perimeter so the cavs will be in a lot of trouble if they have both guys out resulting in switching on defense thats my take on it
nba,not_removed,frye is and was never very quick to begin with so i doubt he would handle the switches well clearly even a quicker and better defender big like adams couldnt contain them no way frye would best hope is to at least get a hand up and then hope they miss
nba,not_removed,no they will get eaten alive by the warriors small ball lineup they are both terrible on defense
nba,not_removed,given how well okc has played against sas and gsw despite all the purported matchup nightmares any presumptive notion of soandso is going to get murdereddestroyed etc is dangerously premature
nba,not_removed,if they play both cavs are ded you heard it here first
nba,not_removed,frye is a taller version of anthony morrow
nba,not_removed,itd be a cakewalk for the warriors to get to the paint
nba,not_removed,if you make frye chase around a smallball you will be very sorry best you could hope in that case is that he trades made for layups and he doesnt have the rebounding game or post game to punish a smaller player inside i think theyre limited to him when bogut or ezeli are in the game
nba,not_removed,i mean they could they might get killed on defense but that would also keep our defense honest and give them more room to operate we wouldnt be able to just leave someone open they would really need to be hitting their shots though
nba,not_removed,with no rim protection the warriors are going to dominate the paint i think the cavs lack of any paint patrol might make these games less close than the thunder games cavs have a great offense but tt is simply not a rim protector and the small ball perimeter spacing lineup of frye and love is simply an atrocious defensive lineup especially in the paint where curry is an excellent finisher
nba,not_removed,only if they want to help the warriors set some more records
nba,not_removed,love might need to get benched this series
nba,not_removed,love is gonna get killed in this series
nba,not_removed,not that great either a lineup with loveirving is not going to be very good defensively especially if kyrie or jr are in the game too
nba,not_removed,this series is fire against fire but i think lebron has a higher melting point sorry warriors fans
nba,not_removed,if they play love and fryre they will be down by points within minutes
nba,not_removed,best hope is that they can put him in for minutes when steph is out the same way okc managed to get kanter to contribute its not like hes in the starting lineup playing minutes every game as it is
nba,not_removed,this is a bit different though and even then last two games adams kanter and ibaka got murdered off the switches and id rather them guard those switches than k love or frye
nba,not_removed,his post d actually isnt bad at all pnr d is pretty bad tho and his rebounding isnt very good either
