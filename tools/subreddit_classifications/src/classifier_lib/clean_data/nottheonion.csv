nottheonion,removed,im beginning to think that this whole lets start a conversation about race thing is getting to be bull shit designed more to provoke arguments than thoughtful conversationseriously the problem of whiteness is so loaded and they have the nerve to say essentially that the angrier white people get the more they need to talk about it so lets talk about it in a way that insults them the left has gone so far around the block theyve come out from the far right and theyre so blind they dont even recognize it

nottheonion,removed,actually if you look at the census numbers from that time period he killed like of the jews in europe at the time because the holocaust is grossly exaggerated
nottheonion,removed,i mean they werent wrong homosexuality is a divergence from the natural mode of humans if you donve believe me consider how many genders there are there are and how offspring are produced nothing wrong morally with it but lets be scientific here for a minute

nottheonion,removed,i can who is pro amendment and who loves hillary by the comments here quite interesting and kind of sticking as well id like to see all those that are bashing him put in the same situationya know having your head bashed into the concrete and not pull your side arm now que the keyboard warriors

nottheonion,removed,oh please it was a perfect meeting of assholes and stereotypes zimmerman being stereotypically prejudiced and trayvon being the stereotypical young black guy who immediately resorts to violence zimmermans a piece of shit but hes got the right to defend himself when hes getting brutally beaten
nottheonion,removed,it would help him get the hispanic vote
nottheonion,removed,if you harass someone and follow them to their house that is wrong and probably illegal if that person then leaves their house in search of you and begins beating you on the head you have the right to defend yourself is any of this hard to understand
nottheonion,removed,completely agree people are on here talking about having him killed by a black man that buys the gun as if its a joke or even something that should happen are we forgetting that he was proved not guilty and now he is literally unemployable how else is he a upped to do anything at all i did see someone say that hes going to use the money to fund an anti clinton campaign if thats true then i hope some right dude pays a lot for them
nottheonion,removed,lol the left everyone this poor month old baby was just trying to protect his street cred after a creepy ass cracker followed him after he was cutting through yards recently broken into with a hoodie on acting suspicious zimmerman totally deserved the beatdown and plus all he had to do was pull the gun out little old baby trayvon would totally have run away

nottheonion,removed,its just that since younger people are going to be the future of this country and since they are going to have to deal with this decision the longest it makes sense that their interests should be the most prominent older people have lived longer and are generally better informed so it balances out

nottheonion,removed,am i being trolled its like you dont even read the comment youre responding to and you really should do some research on judaism
nottheonion,removed,one there is very often a pattern of abuse and emotional manipulation where a family member takes advantage of a child or younger sibling even in cases where everyone is an adult i can see that would that alone be enough reason for you to ban incestious relationships however what is not unamerican is to tell someone they cant procreate with their immediate family okay but this is my point by which means do you make that decision in your earlier comment you said they are telling them they cant have children with each other because of the high risk of birth defects your reasoning is twisted here if you say i dont support incestious relationships because there is a higher risk of children with birth defects than this is your main criterion the risk of the children being disabled your reasoning seems to be there is a higher risk of disabled children coming out of incestious relationships and i dont want that therefore incestious relationships should not be legal so far this is fair enough but the same reasoning works with nonincestious relationships if one or both parents carry a inheritable genetic defect there is a higher risk of disabled children coming out of relationships where one or both parents are disabled and i dont want that therefore disabled parents should not be allowed to procreate your response to this is its not okay to forbid someone from procreating in general but it is okay to forbid someone from having children with their family members but by which means to you make this decision it cant be the health of the children because you say people who have diseases arent told they cant procreate and they shouldnt be no one should be so obviously disabled parents should be allowed to have children even if there is a higher risk of the children being disabled as well but this was your main criterion in the first place it doesnt check out my question is how do you say its okay for disabled parents to have children its okay for healthy people to have children with everyone but their immediate family but its not okay for family members to have children if your reasons are neither the health risks for the children you think its icky
nottheonion,removed,lol whenever reddit talks about poverty in minority neighborhoods i always say its the familys fault for not having a home environment conducive to learning and valuing education then i get called racist and get told that i need to pay more taxes so their schools can do a better job raising these kids make up your minds

nottheonion,removed,my brothers keeper initiative this just gives students the goals of performing at a normal level they just have to read at their age level graduate hs then move on to higher education or training then they are expected to get a job wow brilliant they are throwing at kids to just perform at a standard level its not even for exceptional achievement what are these kids supposed to take away from this maybe that they are victims and need enormous help to just perform at a standard level something that most kids already do without special help this is just a feel good program that is short sighted and possibly hurtful in the long run given the message it sends fair sentencing act is a united states federal law that reduces the disparity between the amount of crack cocaine and powder cocaine needed to trigger certain federal criminal penalties from a weight ratio to an weight ratio and eliminated the fiveyear mandatory minimum cool so he is helping drug users dealers by reducing their prison sentencing kind of a little late wouldnt you say how about we help people who arent already drug addicts or dealers im not against it just saying its not going to solve the cycle of poverty
nottheonion,removed,i feel the need to get a rant out the majority of the people in this thread just read the headline title with no context and felt the need to fire shots at donald and his supporters and often say things like donalds supporters are so easily manipulatedbrainwashed let me tell you something you are the ones that are easily manipulated by the media you are the ones that make trumps campaign thrive you give him the free publicity that makes him more popular you have three choices only two of which are likely you can choose between an untrustworthy criminal a socialist democratic socialist whatever the fuck same end result or somebody who is actually good with money and is a negotiator go ahead and vote for another corporate cog if you really want one in office pretty clear to me have a good election trump haters
nottheonion,removed,bitch please hes written entire books negotiated trade deals with extremely classly people all over from usa to uk to china gone to the best schools in probably the world as well the reason he talks the way he does is because get this hes been trained to talk like that for this election you can look up videos of him on youtube before this election and see exactly what i mean hes incredibly articulate when he wants to be
nottheonion,removed,apparently telling the truth is antagonizing and insulting this is why trump supporters get punched in the face its incredibly irritating and frustrating to deal with a group of people that thinks they posses the truth especially when the vast majority of that truth can be easily disproved by a single google search
nottheonion,removed,his whole plan every time hes run is to boost his media presence and get more exposure for his brand ie trump so he can make more money andor gain more influence over those above him
nottheonion,removed,would he be wrong
nottheonion,removed,hey there i think its past your bedtime now

nottheonion,removed,its a tax for a good causehuman trafficking i mean they could have just proposed a statewide tax hike but instead they just tax adults buying a computer an extra i seriously dont see the problem how many laptops do you plan to buy this year plus if its for your kid you dont even have to pay it
nottheonion,removed,bill can go fuck himself surely
nottheonion,removed,bill really needs to mind his own damn business
nottheonion,removed,i fucking hate this bill guy why does he hate porn so much
nottheonion,removed,damn it bill
nottheonion,removed,who is this bill asshole
nottheonion,removed,well the guards had decided to turn a blind eye just because you are able to get something over on one guard shift or a few individuals does not mean you have set a precedent when i was locked up all the guards swapped out in shifts the guard shift change was done in conjunction with a prisoner count guards from both shifts would pair up and do a body count some shifts had a soft watch captain and others had one that followed all the rules just because you got away with something one or a few times does not make it legit your logic astounds me
nottheonion,removed,fuck this bill guy
nottheonion,removed,this is so stupid though every society needs a justice system its similar to a fire rescue system should we not have to pay for it because let those irresponsible retards burn
nottheonion,removed,coincidently the same words your parents used when they had you
nottheonion,removed,why the fuck is this news and why should i give a shit
nottheonion,removed,rape them back
nottheonion,removed,itt outraged pseudofeminists rely on amateur journalism that completely misinterprets what the nypd captain actually said read the article hes saying rapes by acquaintances arent particularly troubling why theyre usually openandshut cases compared to stranger rapes you got your suspect and evidence isnt that hard to obtain stranger rapes are harder more troubling because you have way less leads to go on the victim cant pull out a name the persons unknown but you know keep taking what he said out of context just to feel good about being outraged read the damn article
nottheonion,removed,its because usa law is very weak on its ability to get lovers to prosecute each other hell i think most laws have a hard time
nottheonion,removed,god what a fucking troll
nottheonion,removed,its a bummer that he got the thread nuked before i could read the replies i was interested in reading about the stuff i get that victims could have gotten triggered by reading the comments but honestly they knew what to expect in a post titled former rapists ama
nottheonion,removed,this is why im never getting married if your wife gets pissed off she can just throw you to the dogs with a he said she said that she is bound to win
nottheonion,removed,the police consider stranger rapes more concerning is because it generates more fear in the community
nottheonion,removed,please link to the case where an inebriated married couple had sex and one of them was arrested for rape
nottheonion,removed,its mostly white women being raped so who gives a flying fuck
nottheonion,removed,welcome to sjw culture where the mos offended wins
nottheonion,removed,troll harder my mentallydisadvantaged friend and good luck in that cruel world
nottheonion,removed,also thank you mods for deleting that comment
nottheonion,removed,would have been some shot wardens at my home that day
nottheonion,removed,youre an idiot
nottheonion,removed,well the story would be different for me as those wardens would all be instantly dead no way on earth any of them would escape
nottheonion,removed,so its illegal to own the deer sure i understand that so lets tell them its illegal then shoot it because it was so dangerous deadly force was obviously needed fuck id have shot the warden
nottheonion,removed,if you discharge a weapon at something i love on my property while trespassing dont forget your kevlar
nottheonion,removed,you might be right though if they were caring for it while it was injured i dont see a problem with what they did one thing is for sure though youre definitely an asshole
nottheonion,removed,get some people together burst into his home then execute his pet then tell him it was within your rights
nottheonion,removed,the phone number for the kansas department of wildlife and parks for dodge city is i think it should ring non stop about this
nottheonion,removed,he said they were within their rights to shoot it but the courteous thing would have been to give the family time to get a license at least thats what i got by using my brain
nottheonion,removed,yes im glad we have a government whos smart enought to raise the children of our country it is a shame that nazi trump took it over think of all of the dead children their bodies will rot and smell up our tolerance protests not my president
nottheonion,removed,game wardens have way too much power they can walk right into your house shoot your dog and get into your freezer that should get them shot dead but it doesnt happen
nottheonion,removed,it says the disease cant be tested for
nottheonion,removed,a man was trespassing in my property with a gun he had it trained ready to shoot and i felt he was a threat so i shot him to protect my family game warden how often does someone see a game warden i figured it was a ranger smith costume
nottheonion,removed,it is not just animal lives the wardens came onto his property without permission and started shooting cops and game wardens are notorious for not caring who they kill when they get a chance to shoot someone or something i applaud anyone that puts down oathbreaking pieces of shit like these wardens
nottheonion,removed,youre a dumbshit they nurtured it back to health and it loved them for that
nottheonion,removed,someone find out this fuck head wardens name
nottheonion,removed,i dont like to wish ill on people but some stories on reddit make my blood boil and i cant help myself isnt kansas a standyourground state oh he was acting very threatening and waving his guns around and i feared for my own safety and for that of my family
nottheonion,removed,anyone knowscan find wardens name address etc
nottheonion,removed,is it wrong if i feel that anyone who shoots at a pet deserves to get shot back at like if someone just walked into my yard and shot my dog i dont want that persons leaving my yard alive
nottheonion,removed,honestly i would be so overcome with rage that i would have an incredibly difficult time not killing the person responsible for that kind of action
nottheonion,removed,private land means you can kill these guys they have zero reason to be on your land without an active warrant wardens all over are generally giant pieces of shit
nottheonion,removed,in a very honest plea what can be done about this concerning making sure the warden doesnt get away with this he wont be prosecuted since it was a wild animal but theres always public shame
nottheonion,removed,whats the game wardens name
nottheonion,removed,all cops might not be mad but nearly every warden is someone who wanted to be a cop but couldnt and nearly everyone one of them is a dick i can assure not one of them was nice to work with i have family that would go out and hunt together and they would all shoot at the warden whenever they spotted him because hed always spot the tiniest thing to give them a ticket and ruin the trip so dance warden dance
nottheonion,removed,honestly if i was the owner of that deer i would have ran up to the wildlife warden grabbed his weapon and shot him through the face i wouldnt give a fuck about any consequences if they fatally shoot someone whom i love human or not this would be the only result
nottheonion,removed,or new air holes so you can breath better at the bottom of a river
nottheonion,removed,thats basically every southern hunter though giant trucks guns shooting helpless animals to inflate their redneck ego
nottheonion,removed,kill him and do the time for it
nottheonion,removed,httpksoutdoorscomkdwptinfocontactus is the link to the kansas wildlife parks and tourism contact form please send a condemning message like i just did pointing out that this was a disgusting and inhumane act by a group of cowards wanting an excuse to sate their bloodlust by killing an innocent creature shameful and reprehensible these people should be in jail
nottheonion,removed,pretty annoying that you little shit stormers plague reddit nitpicking at semantics instead of adding anything of intelligence to the conversation and its funny how you trash posters always target people compassionately standing up for something and avoid intellectual threads read a book
nottheonion,removed,at least wait until theyre not around if youre going to trespass and kill someones pets you inconsiderate child
nottheonion,removed,one gave my dad crap for not having filled out the proper form before hunting on my maternal grandfathers land that warden was transferred across the state after that some parts of the country still operate under a clan system
nottheonion,removed,i assume there is a part where everyone took turns fucking the deer carcass afterward i meanit is kansasits what they do
nottheonion,removed,ok so which they did because they feared it was carrying a diseases which is not easily tested for is a need to kill that deer because it could possibly carry disease that they have seen no symptoms of or has had any complaints about this was completely uncessary cowboy bullshit they could have let that deer go if the only issue was it was illegal to keep a deer as pet but im sure they were like oh it will come back we have to shoot it fuck you cowboy asshole you arent protecting shit you just wanted to shoot something
nottheonion,removed,or you know someone who doesnt just lie back and let their loved ones be murdered in front of their eyes
nottheonion,removed,people lol
nottheonion,removed,in a very honest plea what can be done about this concerning making sure the warden doesnt get away with this im sure we all know the answer to that its clear that men like this dont learn and are a danger to society the best answer would be to shoot this filth through the face
nottheonion,removed,game wardens are literally some of this worst people ive ever had the unfortunate displeasure of interacting with not intelligent not respectful im not a prejudiced person but after my run ins with them if i hear you work for the game commission i think youre a piece of shit and i hope you get slowly eaten by a bear while you scream helplessly in agony mods this is a wish for an act of nature not a call for violence
nottheonion,removed,fuck the govt should have shot the wardens right after they are power hungry assholes
nottheonion,removed,this was in my state and i would have shot the wardens if it was me in fact i can reach anywhere in this state in about hours
nottheonion,removed,i hope he dies soon or hell exists preferably both
nottheonion,removed,wow hopefully someone doesnt slit this mans throat someday that would be terrible especially if his daughter was watching
nottheonion,removed,legally the warden doesnt need your permission to go onto your property hope you have fun sucking bubbas dick in prison you redneck fuck
nottheonion,removed,no one cares get a real job
nottheonion,removed,you mean pieces of shit trespassing with guns on private property right
nottheonion,removed,calls for violence arent gonna fly here but youre totally fine with posting violence and justifying authoritarian violence just cant condone calling for actual justice can we
nottheonion,removed,i am anyone that takes pleasure in bringing pain to a family for no other reason than a power trip deserves to be shot
nottheonion,removed,shoot him and bury him
nottheonion,removed,i would deffiantly black out and wake up pressing my thumbs into his eye sockets like when hafthor bjornson killed that guy in game of thrones
nottheonion,removed,well then you have something in common with it
nottheonion,removed,its not ok but it would be a small relief for humanity
nottheonion,removed,wheres kevin peña when you need him
nottheonion,removed,humans are still animals if somwbody came to my house and killed my dog i wouldnt just let them get away with human lives arent greater than any other animals lives
nottheonion,removed,burned is better to be honest but bones suck with burning from what i see in movies
nottheonion,removed,that game warden would come home and find their family dogs decapitated head in their young childs bedroom you cause me pain and ill make sure you feel the same pain
nottheonion,removed,i know right sometimes you have to kill someone to help them sometimes the girls in my van they beg me to kill them so thats what i do their eyes look grateful when im strangling them its so beautiful
nottheonion,removed,write a complaint
nottheonion,removed,yeah names and pictures and addresses of those monsters should be flying everyone on twitter and other social media hunting is one thing this was murder i dont care if you ban me here i will find the info and spread it all around and make sure they get whats coming for them least of the being fired and being driven out of their communities
nottheonion,removed,this is why everyone needs to be more dangerous people wouldnt fuck with your shit if they knew you might put a bullet through their brain its called balance
nottheonion,removed,people them are fucking shit all i can hope is that hell is real and that there is always a special place for them there a fucker like that needs to be shot in the legs with a shotgun that way he cant do anything like that ever again
nottheonion,removed,i get that no one should post the wardens personal contact info but hes a public servant so it should be perfectly fine if someone wants to post his work contact information right
nottheonion,removed,i wouldnt be upset to hear an update that this warden was put down in the same way
nottheonion,removed,can we please find this wardens name email etc this calls for a good old fashion doxx frankly he needs to be shot if only i lived closer
nottheonion,removed,stay armed my friends someone comes onto my property and starts shooting they arent leaving without holes and a stretcher
nottheonion,removed,i made the stupid mistake of watching the video now im crying seriously hope that guy dies what a piece of shit
nottheonion,removed,thats bullshit certain situations call for violence these men should be tortured to death slowly
nottheonion,removed,time for everyone to callemail the kansas department of wildlife and parks and tell these people how disgusting their actions are i personally would never keep a deer as a pet but that does not give anyone the write to do this especially in front of a family these grown macho men overloaded with testosterone are employed and paid through our tax dollars
nottheonion,removed,you are in the wrong you no longer have my permission to post to this forum
nottheonion,removed,an eye for an eye
nottheonion,removed,are you kidding me you as a mod on a subreddit are going to overflex your power and outlaw the posting of public information to a public department of government so you would ban a user who wrote out the twitter address of the white house if they wanted to complain about obama you would ban someone who gave out the facebook page to the bureau of justice statistics if they wanted to quantify rape statistics are you going to van the person who posts a link to the fbi if he finds a suspected terrorist think about what youre saying here this isnt joe blows house and personal cell number were talking about were talking about united states government agencies information doesnt get any more public than that jesus christ why dont you mods just come and shoot my pet deer if you want to be that authoritative
nottheonion,removed,what prevents you from shooting at the warden since he is on your property is it not legal to shoot at ppl you dont want on your property anymore
nottheonion,removed,just because the law says you should do something doesnt mean you should nobody would blame these guys for letting this one slide these guys are just heartless pricks that just wanted to kill something what goes around comes around
nottheonion,removed,i know theres no doxxing rules etc but could anonymous please get on doxxing the pieces of shit who did this
nottheonion,removed,a witch hunt is exactly the shit that needs to happen animal cruelty is not acceptable and should be outed as a society fuck your passive attitude
nottheonion,removed,instead of threatening violence call the governors office this is specifically the outlet for public opinion on policy issues httpsgovernorkansasgovcontactcontactthegovernor tell them you would like them to expedite changing their policy on euthanizing wildlife the secretary of wildlife has already voiced this is his goal he reports to and is appointed by the governor of kansas
nottheonion,removed,shoot that warden as soon as he steps foot on your property get off my lawn
nottheonion,removed,who was he im sure this wasnt legal and we can have him done
nottheonion,removed,its a good way to get mistaken for a bear and shot the next time hes on my property
nottheonion,removed,gg mods i wonder what they are doing with that meat hopefully some liberal tear flavored jerky
nottheonion,removed,yes it is go guck yourself
nottheonion,removed,this is just terrible its sad nothing can be done about it although the second amendment people — maybe there is i dont know
nottheonion,removed,people are saying the deer was an illegal pet in that state sure so why again are armed men marching into a citizens land to shoot and kill an illegal pet feel free to shoot a warning shot on my land ill shoot one too
nottheonion,removed,are you even capable of making an argument and do you realize that just because someone disagress with you that does not make them a troll or are you this stupid i am being totally serious when i say that applying morality to animals is for the most part pointless i would never torture or abuse an animal but beyond that most basic form of kindness i do not feel any moral obligation to animals
nottheonion,removed,if that was my deer there would be missing persons reports for those wardens
nottheonion,removed,fake and gay why move the camera away right when they shoot it queers
nottheonion,removed,why is this warden a fucker the state owns the wildlife i bet that she has a mortgage and also thinks that she owns her own home its fun to watch the world crash around people who cant accept reality because theyre stupid
nottheonion,removed,or a good way to end up dead in the woods with a bullet in your head id definitely be thinking about it if some wanabe cop pulled this shit
nottheonion,removed,if it was me i would have killed the asswipe who shot the deer for no fucking good reason
nottheonion,removed,you are a moron and a neanderthal
nottheonion,removed,idiot
nottheonion,removed,oregon zoo keeps deer im pretty sure other zoos do as well your an idiot stop talking out your ass

nottheonion,removed,i wonder if one day these wardens will try and ruin someones hunt because they can do what they want and it turns out that the guy whos hunt they just ruined couldnt give a shit about laws and they get murdered
nottheonion,removed,if someone did that to my pet i wouldve straight up killed them
nottheonion,removed,i live close to the town i will be stopping by very soon to rape the warden with my rock hard cock no lube just justice i will videotape everything and post it on rcatsstandingup
nottheonion,removed,i would have shot that fucking warden and taken my chances in front of a jury of my peers
nottheonion,removed,the problem here is the scumbag warden shoot the warden in the head see how he likes it
nottheonion,removed,the warden should be considered kos after this
nottheonion,removed,hand the notice over then leave no reason for the warden to stay there he clearly went there with the intention of killing the deer a lot of things are in fact solved by shooting people
nottheonion,removed,fucking tell the cop no this is mother fucking texas and if he tries to do so anyways shoot the fucking cop
nottheonion,removed,wow man you sure turned that one around the suspense was killing me i was like what else can hurt a human and then oh shit you just turned it around on him and rejt him right good mate
nottheonion,removed,the people that did this need to die
nottheonion,removed,is there anyone i can call to voice my displeasure about this decision even though i dont live in the area i mean i cant do much but tell them why i think this was a bad decision but if enough people do that thats how change starts to happen right
nottheonion,removed,i cried and threw up after reading this story i cant take this stuff if anything like this happened to me id end up in jail or dead over what id do to this piece of shit
nottheonion,removed,offsite witch hunt link

nottheonion,removed,do we know who the three men are yet is there an offsite witch hunt link
nottheonion,removed,hopefully someone shoots those cops
nottheonion,removed,hey america good job reenforcing that reputation of solving everything problem with gun relevant
nottheonion,removed,you never know there are some crazy motherfuckers in this world some people really never had anything going on with their lives and would love to kill all three of these men just to feel good about themselves
nottheonion,removed,hope he loses more than that
nottheonion,removed,i would murder this fkers whole family in front of his eyes and see how he likes it
nottheonion,removed,hey guys ill be posting the witch hunt information elsewhere not to be alarmed
nottheonion,removed,what can we as redditors do to ensure the warden is properly punished
nottheonion,removed,you hate them over a few idiots on reddit making up stories lol
nottheonion,removed,i live in the midwest our police and dnr have to organize hunts to thin the herd where the police literally sit on top of corn feeders and pop deer at point blank range in urban areas chronic wasting disease is a serious problem several municipal zoos still have deer and the wildlife rescues will still try to save them we also hunt them heavily with bag limits as high as either sex
nottheonion,removed,buck lives matter
nottheonion,removed,if those dudes had kids their kids should be shot
nottheonion,removed,wardens the worst fucking scum of the earth apparently if someone came into my house and harmed any of my pets id straight up do something way more illegal than keeping an illegal pet
nottheonion,removed,i would pursue this in every possible way
nottheonion,removed,the wrong animal was shot in this video
nottheonion,removed,this man is a disgrace and should pay for his action i hope something bad happen to him
nottheonion,removed,shoot my family pet and youll get shot in return that warden would be dead if he were on my property
nottheonion,removed,wouldnt it be a shame if someone found out who he was and framed him for some sort of crime

nottheonion,removed,as someone who has watched and enjoyed video game relatedlets play content i think this is a really iffy situation its really difficult for me to say fuck nintendo over this because theyre just trying to defend their content in the sea of fair use it is kind of absurd that someone can simply play a video game talk over it upload that and make a career out of doing so theres nothing transformative about that but tons and tons of people do it hell some of them dont even talk over it they just show them playing the game without commentary at all yes there are people who will buy a game because they watch lp content and there are also people who will watch games instead of buying them at all it works both in their favor and to their detriment i care about content creators and all but you cant pretend like its a onesided situation and nintendo is entirely in the wrong fair use probably goes way farther than it should and on the other hand because of the way youtube and other content hosting services work fair use is almost useless because you can just get content taken down for no reason anyway even if its something completely original you made yourself
nottheonion,removed,it is not high liability at all you simply dont understand mobos so you dont touch them but that is not justification to act like they are some scary fragile thing
nottheonion,removed,bigotry intolerance towards those with a different opinion ive tried to be reasonable but you cant argue with a bigot

nottheonion,removed,ive seen it twice first time for a ticket after ticketmasters insane fees about before and second time for a pop it was totally worth it both times but im not sure i can justify seeing it again i may try to see the chicago cast since the gf roomies and i all really want to eat at alinea
nottheonion,removed,but but your original comment said that it probably doesnt cost anything anyways i just called them and told them that and asked if they would cover my phone now and they told me to read the fucking article before i post stupid shit in the comment section and for me to stop typing stupid assumptive shit until i know what the fuck im talking about they must have thought i was you silly apple
nottheonion,removed,yeah i did eleven madison this year and it was the best dining experience of my life i think theyre getting my vacationtoeatatarestaurant money in

nottheonion,removed,weve been wrong all these years while we were afraid of skynet and robots the food snuck up on us
nottheonion,removed,first of all stop this petty shit lighten up youve clearly oassed judgement several times citation needed also dictionary needed implying that their way of thinking is just their way as well as that its not right when it inarguably is that statement does not imply that it is only the viewpoint of those specific people it merely establishes the polarizing nature of the dispute you moron stop trying to play the victim card for them and are they wrong again youre trying to have the debate not what im arguing and i dont want to get into that discussion because you clearly dont get this yet i am not taking a side in this i am merely pointing out that pence not me could think that they are wrong its called looking at it from both viewpoints and is a concept you dont seem to get for some reason
nottheonion,removed,i cant tell whether youre years old or a troll you have the self awareness of a grapefruit

nottheonion,removed,well if no one important is attending how on earth do they expect to effect any meaningful change
nottheonion,removed,you need to work on your reading comprehension
nottheonion,removed,because your point is innocent until judged guilty by my lawyer no it isnt i have never said that in every comment you just lie about what i am saying who are you even lying too it is just us two i say that you are ignoring my point and you say stupid shit about you quoting me and pretending you arent ignoring my point but then you are still saying shit like this well this isnt going anywhere there is nothing i can say i said what i said but you dont actually care what i said because you ignore it time and time again i mean just use some common sense how many people would actually disagree with what i said not many youre clearly just trolling now i mean you asked me to quote you where you said a lawyer enabling a rapist to walk free is no more disgusting than an actor playing a villain i literally quoted it in my last comment you literally said it is no more disgusting than an actor playing a villain in a movie and this was to the question put it this way do you not think it is disgusting if a lawyer was trying to get a murderer rapist child abuser etc a light sentence like this month one or get them off with no punishment i mean the fact that you compared me asking for a yes or no for a question on whether you find something disgusting or not to a question about the sky being green or red you clearly have no interest in this argument i mean the comparison makes literally zero sense throughout this whole chain of comments you just time and time again ignore what i say or lie that i said things that i did not or say random irrelevant things about the sky and whenever i bring up the fact that you are talking absolute nonsense you just ignore that and say some other completely random things you probably realised that you was wrong a little while back and thats why youre trolling just so you can keep the argument alive you look like an absolute twat saying looool in caps and putting smiley faces in the comment but i guess thats the point so well done for acting like a child but with that attitude this argument isnt going anywhere so im not going to respond to you anymore although like most of the things i said you will probably ignore this too

nottheonion,removed,ive seen this comment from you a few times now and ill just flat out say that youre an idiot yeah there are laws for this but just because there are laws against murder doesnt magically make it go away also plenty of people are ignorant of quite a few laws through no fault of their own even and you didnt address the point that consent in a situation like this is incredibly tricky to define because there are a crapton of variables that have to be accounted for you should probably reconsider your argument and actually address the points in question instead of spouting off some canned statement thinking youre good

nottheonion,removed,of london is muslim if you were to deport those people you would be able to solve the housing crisis overnight selling off the possessions of the deported muslims could make up for the housing budget cuts deporting all of londons muslims would also probably reduce the citys crime rate by half which would allow you to take further funding from the police and create a housing trust fund which could be used to invest in the construction of new housing

nottheonion,removed,its important for people to remember the distinction between someones story being backed up by video footage vs entirely supported by video footage too often the footage comes out later and all it shows is them arguing in the hall and then going into her office or it shows a pinch but not on her genitals in a world of clickbait headlines and deceptively ambiguous journalism its best to read everything with extreme skepticism and wait for real evidence
nottheonion,removed,he doesnt want to assume her gender so he checks thus being politically correct and a liar
nottheonion,removed,theyre clearly referring to cnn refusing to admit that the people in the facebook torture video were racist even though they said on video fuck white people s

nottheonion,removed,at least he said something the liberal democrat illuminati child rapists probably dont say much

nottheonion,removed,not a trump voter i downvoted this because its just a variation of the annoying lets scour the world for random gop local politican being awful and pretend its a national issue while not doing the same for the other side this isnt about trump its something that ive seen often since at least essentially its low effort political back patting also it really is on the top of all so while its perfectly plausible that a place like rthedonald brigaded it earlier it is currently so highly upvoted that normal people are seeing it now also social media trump voter is hardly representative of people who voted for it

nottheonion,removed,how is this a world event elected officials in the us does something pathetic isnt a world event its clickbait meant to flatter the readers self image this isnt a national story its not even a state level story its a random local story that got picked up because someone was actively looking for the sort of republicans are evil piece you find every once and awhile
nottheonion,removed,jesus christ when obama won the first time there were all these jokes about how black people were gonna think of it like their turn fucking white guys have years of feeling ostracized and they actually act like comical porttiyals of black people getting revenge on hundreds of years of oppression
nottheonion,removed,given how that whole event played out its hard to argue that it was a norm maintaining event its not mainstream behavior and was treated as such trump won anyways if this was mainstream behavior you would fine actual mainstream figures actively endorsing this sort of behavior you didnt do that this argument is based on pathetic crawling through local government reports in an attempt to find anything that would be clickbait to a national audience dont kid yourself this isnt news or mainstream commentary its shit clickbait of a long established variety random local politicans does something insanethe other guys generally have trait x
nottheonion,removed,its a way to get an anti trump post to the front page this isnt even oniony trying to bury the real story of the day project veritas part i undercover investigation exposes groups plotting criminal activity at trump inauguration
nottheonion,removed,lol what the fuck are you talking about you either ignored my post with multiple instances of fake liberal news causing problems or you are blind
nottheonion,removed,youre missing my point this is not a national story the only reason it is a national story is because people are actively looking for dumb clickbait i sincerely believe i could find an example of estimating now democratic elected public officials who sexually assaulted someone and blamed it on something political now it wouldnt be political correctness because that story would be seeking to flatter team reds self identity and something mocking pc is a team blue thing i dont actively seek out those stories because they literally tell us nothing
nottheonion,removed,he literally pinched her thats it imagine someone pinching you once on your puss puss right why is that so disgusting to you is it rude sure does it deserve a slap sure is it literal sexual assault years in jail rapist fuck no pull your head out of your pinched out ass you prudish fuck
nottheonion,removed,project veritas part i undercover investigation exposes groups plotting criminal activity at trump inauguration

nottheonion,removed,its justicewarrior jargon for downvoting someone just because of who they are or where they are aligned politically as if that rises to the level of their own bull shit they earned the down voted for who they are and what they think if they dont like it they can change both but since that would require humility and selfanalysis plus the moral strength needed to actually improve oneself they will away be downvoted when they expose themselves to their fellow humans as the cultural waste they are
nottheonion,removed,yeah nno homo am i right guise
nottheonion,removed,dont click this isnt about trumpessentially its low effort political back patting so you launched an ad hominem attack against me forpretty much making the same point i downvoted this post for being partisan click bait that mean i dont think it should be on the top of reddit generating lots of extra revenue and clicks yes its not a story of national interestimportance its popcorn to eat and circlejerk to so am i being a snowflake or can we set aside the culture war idiocy for the moment its a national story only because people want to pretend self flattering clickbait is actually a serious look at whats going on in the world im clearly making a normative claim and youre making a descriptive one the mere existence of the thread is that is that it seems too fucked up to be true hence why it is in rnottheonion im seeing a lot more of the partisan clickbait aspect here than you are thats why its at upvotes but if we ignored that this would be a fine place bs story type national news source scours the nationworld to find random anecdote that paints the other side in a bad light you could extend this broader but im not sure whats so hard to comprehend about my basic point a dem calling bs on that but i dont see how we can easily prove this i could give the standard conservative rundown on this but i doubt this would convince you given you probably have already considered this
nottheonion,removed,breaking news random man is an asshole thats not a national story if you can make a credible argument that theres a cultural change going on you may have a national story but this is just elected officials did something wrong
nottheonion,removed,the behavior wasnt seen as that objectionable you have a point but that objectionable has to deal with the very high base level of partisan polarization in the country but this strikes me as a conversation worth having as opposed to the random local politican nature of this post

nottheonion,removed,ive been through some heavy sustained childhood to adulthood sexual abuse your scenario is not how it went for me and httpwwwumdeduocrsmfileswhyissexualassaultunderreportedpdf my anecdote i linked the fact sheet version for quick reading i love how logical you sound step one step two everything goes according to plan and to social expectation i wish my life could have been like that sometimes i think that way too shit happened anyway i never wanted to go to police one abused me in addition to all the other crap at age still dont want to i just want myself and other survivors of any gender to be able to even talk about it we owe it to every human the rate of false reporting to the rate of rape andor childhood sexual abuse must be absurd i dont have a study on that i do know many ashamed survivors but no one in real life whose lives were ruined by false reporting what im saying is that false reporting is a real problem and is important but a lower priority because people are experiencing violence from sexual abuse everyday i commonly see false reporting accusations thrown around as a way to deny survivors true experiences we need people to be less afraid to talk about abuse not more which is what criminalized reporting would do to people who are already scared of the criminal justice system see fact sheet lying is already something we teach children not to do why dont we teach them not to touch without consent

nottheonion,removed,i dont understand who is pushing this agenda and if it is a feminist thing or what i look at it as men and taking over the female gender and pushing their rights as a woman onto everyone the main issue is about transwomanmen right to use the womans bathroom do woman really want a dude in the bathroom with them its so weird like its men taking over the womans issues i see it as misogynistic
nottheonion,removed,all honesty as transgender is obviously a mental disorder they likely wont know the difference anyways
nottheonion,removed,see this is part of the problem each side is so charged that it takes every tiny offhand and obviously hyperbolic statement as a literal sentiment against all humanity ergo me and everyone feasts on manufactured outrage and demands more
nottheonion,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡° what the fuck is wrong with this planet

nottheonion,removed,transgender should be treated as the mental illness it is there are an incredibly tiny amount of people born intersex in which their gender is indeterminate transgender is nothing more than putting a costume of the opposite gender on someone who will test genetically and chemically as male or female
nottheonion,removed,i think its because trans is a mental illness and normalizing a mental illness with society is what is shocking but its been happening for years so maybe its just the news fault for constantly going on about it
nottheonion,removed,clist wannabes in the right wing entertainment complex dont deserve any respect if she were not a formerly attractive black woman no one would give a shit what she has to say fox news affirmative action in action
nottheonion,removed,the trangender thing is a total fraud except for people with the physical expression of both genders the whole topic is hokum it is nothing more than yet another expression of sexual deviance people are more than welcome deviate as they wish of course but in private not rubbing the rest of our noses in it tldr you do not have right to make your personal freakshow a public matter get over it dash is right at least in spirit
nottheonion,removed,but then men in dresses would have an excuse to get their cock out outside
nottheonion,removed,transexual people have a mental illness and in thanks largely to people like you this illness is untreated instead this generation of pansies accepts and encourages it and now people like me have to risk having our children share bathrooms with members of the opposite sex are you fucking kidding me

nottheonion,removed,lol you havent left mums basement in a while eh
nottheonion,removed,hopefully france enjoys their new caliphate bunch of cheese eating cowards letting their women people and country be raped and taken over
nottheonion,removed,the only thing to do is import millions of more muslims to rape your women convert your religion to islam and destroy your culture and replace it with their own also call anyone that criticizes islam a bigot and have them thrown in jail or take their kids away
nottheonion,removed,you probably have low testosterone

nottheonion,removed,you are a waste of human sentience no one cares about you that is why you create reddit accounts to harass human beings by repeating memetic neologisms at best you will make an arbitrarily indefensible statement to me to boost yourself esteem to which i will not be able to respond if i cannot respond to your puerile aspersion that should convey to you the infertile nature of your claim that you run from rebuttal you flee from the truth you show no concern for reality only your childish attempts to participate therein you are a waste of human life you will never mean anything to anyone just remember one thing son i dont want pickles on my big mac thanks
nottheonion,removed,ms ferguson talked about how much she loved hillary clinton and hated donald trump the complaint says peanut buttering is better than firebombing and trump plans on firebombing everybody in other countries ms ferguson reportedly said i am not sure the bucket reaches all the way to the well with this one these odd people first they complain that mr trump doesnt want to announce his military strategy and now they supposedly know about it and complain that he will be firebombing
nottheonion,removed,misogynist check republican check probably poor but thinks trump will make him rich check
nottheonion,removed,if the same differences between human populations were found in other animals people would classify them as an entirely different species maybe even a different genus are you a troll or an idiot because thats completely untrue
nottheonion,removed,some passengers said the policy was discriminatory as it only affects people flying on one route from honolulu to pago pago with most passengers being of samoan descent samoans have among the highest rates of obesity in the world row row row your boat you fat bastards
nottheonion,removed,also can i just add that it sucks to sit next to an obese person and have them literally spill over into your space
nottheonion,removed,handicap
nottheonion,removed,fuck yea
nottheonion,removed,ittcomment cancer
nottheonion,removed,this definitely never happened i dont think the captain of an airplane needs you to tell them what a safety hazard is i think theyre fully aware of every safety hazard whether or not ubloodfart says so stuartess nice
nottheonion,removed,abandon all hope ye who read these comments
nottheonion,removed,i stood there until they brought the captain back to tell me i had to sit down and fasten my seatbelt thank you for standing up for the issue these days people tend to take whats given to them i have been trying to speak out lately on various issues by the way everybody be prepared to discuss the issue and be prepared to be in the wrong sometimes we might be wrong so we have be flexible
nottheonion,removed,threatens to sue for humiliation humiliates the fat guy in the process
nottheonion,removed,i think airlines should have to have a few wide seats in the back available to larger patrons its their responsibility to accommodate the customers not the other way around if this actually happened its not fair to the person forced to sit next to a person crammed into a seat too small for them
nottheonion,removed,yeah its the airlines not the fat asses faults they have no self control
nottheonion,removed,points here this is not onionesque at all everyone who wasnt a morbidly obese and selfish person knew it good i dont fucking care how much it hurts your feelings fly on delta if you dont like it but theyll do it soon too you people brought it on yourselves i dont want my life put at risk because some ton snowflake didnt want someone else seeing their weight im pretty sure the pilots dont want to put anyones life at risk either
nottheonion,removed,i dont understand why this is an issue if an airplane is tested under the assumption that of its passengers are of average to slightly above average weight but of them weigh twice as much as the average then you are essentially carrying more people i dont want to ride inside a tube thousands of feet in the air with more weight than it is expected to hold obviously these numbers arent exact at all but my point stands if you weigh lbs or more you are literally affecting other people on a plane whether its comfort or safety i have no issues with people who are overweight but i have an issue with people not acknowledging they might be a bit heftier than they should be last time i flew the guy in the seat next to me was literally spilling into mine i had to spend two hours either shoulder to shoulder with the guy in the other side and only use half my seat or sit on the overweight guys ass rolls sticking under the arm rest im not disputing he cant help it and i dont fault him for it but it shouldnt be a choice i have to make
nottheonion,removed,theyre going to draw your weight on your forehead with a permanent marker i have a feeling if this happened many people would suddenly stop being obese
nottheonion,removed,fuck fat people
nottheonion,removed,remember when the average american wasnt a disgusting pile of fat lose some fucking weight or take a damn bus
nottheonion,removed,back when i would fly lower class i would hate tone sat next to a giant person
nottheonion,removed,god damn sizists obesists antimassiststhats all ive got right now ill update once i learn more terms
nottheonion,removed,it felt good being on an american flight and the two fattest people were british and were trying to abuse a flight attendant to get what they wanted im like take that stereotypes then everyone clapped ok the everyone clapped part is a lie my story is just starting to sound fake enough to warrant it
nottheonion,removed,the genetics argument for obesity is a complete crock of fryer grease for someone to be a mesomorph and not an ectomorph maybe you are what you eat literally be proud be ashamed be whatever you want dont hide behind anything you cant fit behind
nottheonion,removed,discrimination is targeting something you cant change if you dont want to be fat burn more calories than you consume and do so everyday until youre not fat anymore its not discrimination and its not rocket science
nottheonion,removed,oh absolutely not their executives they fly private jet or first class at worst
nottheonion,removed,you must be part of the problem
nottheonion,removed,no really i hadnt noticed downvote more fatty
nottheonion,removed,that is so incredibly sad i cant fathom having it programmed in your head that you might literally starve those kind of mindfucks i can understand how someone would end up with that kind of ed i hope your friend is well now
nottheonion,removed,just fly business or first class its what i do and never have an issue
nottheonion,removed,of course dont be dense im obviously responding to the sentiment in the first half of the comment that came off as if fat people werent worth talking to as if they were some disgusting thing i get why youd want to be comfortable on a flight of course im not arguing that
nottheonion,removed,im sorry youre a fat and cant fit in the seat you paid for but i paid for my entire seat i didnt get a discount because you cant control yourself
nottheonion,removed,its sad how far fatphobia gets you and aa is a crappy airline anyway will try my best to avoid them
nottheonion,removed,your personal embarrassment about your obesity does not trump my right to survive an airplane flight by giving the flight crew the proper data to tell if the center of mass of the airplane is in the correct location for safe flight
nottheonion,removed,touché
nottheonion,removed,it also keeps costs down if you want more leg room get an upgrade or sit in the exit row
nottheonion,removed,came here expecting a slew of removed comments and wasnt disappointed
nottheonion,removed,youre totally right ive list pounds in about months doing this no exercise though
nottheonion,removed,i prefer options instead
nottheonion,removed,rfatpeoplehate world be so proud
nottheonion,removed,good being fat is not normal
nottheonion,removed,feelings should come a distant to fight logistics and safety soooostep on the scales fatty

nottheonion,removed,i have weighed pounds since i stopped growing nobody ever congratulates me fat coddling is real
nottheonion,removed,ive got an carry on and a small backpack i can travel for two weeks without issue bring on my discount
nottheonion,removed,yeah it certainly triggers some people when you talk about the obesity epidemic
nottheonion,removed,ah but you do have insecurities

nottheonion,removed,no losing weight isnt easy neither is anything else worth achieving
nottheonion,removed,portly youre morbidly obese and youre costing us all in higher insurance premiums please consider losing weight for your and our good
nottheonion,removed,im glad there are fat shaming assholes
nottheonion,removed,ahhhhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhh heres my discount coconut
nottheonion,removed,haha youre a manlet
nottheonion,removed,i think reminders are helpful every now and then unless we speak up and remind the obese what a burden they are on others they may continue to think that everything is fine
nottheonion,removed,discounts unite
nottheonion,removed,link unreddit link
nottheonion,removed,perfectly normal evening in that neck of the woods
nottheonion,removed,i used to weigh pounds i knew my i was a burden to other people congratulations on recognizing this youre one of the good ones
nottheonion,removed,did you watch the tapes i doubt it because foval said he has hired homelesscrazy people to do a lot of crazy things in the past but hey at least you just earned another for that post from the clinton campaign congrats
nottheonion,removed,did you watch the videos yes or no
nottheonion,removed,hes costing me money because the costs associated with treating the obese are reflected in all of our insurance premiums healthy care companies arent in the business of providing free care and the costs of obesity are passed along to everyone else in the insurance pool this is basic health economics here are some basic stats from reliable sources current estimates on the costs associated with obesity range from stateofobesityorgrates and are expected to continue rising the world cancer research fund estimates that about wwwcancerorgcancercancercausesdietandphysicalactivitybodyweightandcancerriskbodyweightandcancerriskeffects physical inactivity excess alcohol consumption andor poor nutrition give me a break man my position and points arent radical or ridiculous at all the state of our collective health is
nottheonion,removed,whatever lets just all be fucking fat as we can get and say who gives a shit wheeeee
nottheonion,removed,ive lost only pounds over the last years and the progress was so gradual that i dont personally see any difference not even in mirrors the only way i notice it is when im looking at an old picture something id prefer to burn i could stand to lose more i have a horrible selfimage thats crippled me socially for almost years and it was particularly horrible in high school since then ive come to more or less stop giving a shit what people think but thats led me to bounce up and down and ultimately plateau mentally im better but physically im stuck ive had people tell me i look better but i just smile nod maybe say thanks not believing a word of it mostly because i know i still have a very long path ahead of me i still consider where im at unacceptable even if they dont so im with you its hard to see a visual difference especially when youre stuck looking at yourself all day even when i lose weight and look in the mirror i see my mental image of myself not my actual body
nottheonion,removed,fair enough ive never been concerned about tubby sat behind me causing a crash but it annoys me that we paid the same ticket price and our luggage allowances are the same
nottheonion,removed,member when voting determined what stayed up and what got removed
nottheonion,removed,ah regressive projection i love it if you cant see how a political party covertly hiring a homelesscrazy person to commit some type of illegal activity in order to forward their agenda then you are either amazingly dense or amazingly deluded
nottheonion,removed,yes alcohol tobacco and many other factors are involved but thats a bit of a red herring since we arent talking about those other factors were talking about obesity thats an interesting point about the obese dying younger and thus costing less perhaps longterm i havent done any research on that but as diabetes is one of the biggest problems with obesity and its expensive to treat and the obese can live a long time while on diabetic care i wonder how it all pans out my guess not well for the consumers
nottheonion,removed,if i remember correctly this wasnt a civilian plane this was a military plane that was transporting multiple heavy vehicles the straps were not secured properly on one vehicle causing it to break free slide backwards and break the straps on the other vehicles all the vehicles slid to the back of the plane and thats was caused the drop
nottheonion,removed,do i see an actual trigger warning on reddit what the fuck
nottheonion,removed,lol who would argue with this
nottheonion,removed,we are not a bastion of free speech
nottheonion,removed,repost
nottheonion,removed,im surprised mods havent locked this comment thread too you guys need to relax and quit locking threads all willynilly its ruining the sub and im about to unsubscribe because of it
nottheonion,removed,no amount of pivoting on your or anyone elses part is going to change that learn what words mean before you try using them in public i didnt pivot i already made the point that clinton was cleared by the fbi hillary is just corrupt for my feels tell me so good job not refuting anything i had to say though good job pretending that bull headed is the same as smart im not going to repeat myself because you think repeating yourself is a viable argument strategy trump isnt my candidate bullshit trump is the throw people in jail regardless of what the legal system says candidate he shares your lack of value for the justice system
nottheonion,removed,to be fair have you seen this years election mature adult are not words i would used to describe either candidate but then we cant all be as grown up as you

nottheonion,removed,oh good were making ground on a social media site too bad thats not where human lives are
nottheonion,removed,if any one is concerned about this the mods and i are working on making a group thatcan help players stay safe over at rteamrocketgo
nottheonion,removed,urabidbriefcase would love an answer to this one
nottheonion,removed,i think the difference in this case is that the painting was specifically being sold as an unauthenticated painting if ive understood this correctly if the sellers were claiming that it was a genuine painting then doig would have been within his legal rights to contact the buyers otherwise had the deal gone through doig could have publicly disavowed the work and the onus would be on the buyer to sue the seller for damages which may not have been possible because again the painting was being sold as an unauthenticated work
nottheonion,removed,i was flirted with by a barista for some reason she thought i was funny so i gave her a note to see if she would be interested in dinner yikes so many red flags in one encounter
nottheonion,removed,thats because i know that in general the entire structure of our society at least in terms of corporate personhood and the fact that we are more or less a corporatocracy is amoral and doesnt give a fuck about human beings nah it is because you personally are amoral and dont give a fuck about human beings you yourself you are the problem not the corporations not other people you bad people assume that everyone else in the world is bad thats just how they operate if you think that the world is an amoral place that doesnt care about people thats not because the world is an amoral place it is because you are amoral you justify your own behavior by saying everyone else is evil so i have the right to fuck them welcome to reality you are the problem you personally most people arent amoral if they were society wouldnt function most people are stupid fuckers but they generally follow the rules and dont go out of the way to fuck other people over and the profit of a huge megacorp is hardly going to be threatened by here and there of course it is is a lot of money especially multiplied it isnt nothing it is something if goes missing thats a problem if goes missing a lot thats a big problem because a quarter of a lot of peoples wages you should see my departments monthly legal bills legal bills are a part of doing business it isnt money simply evaporating funny thing people who pirate movies probably the vast majority of reddit users are also bad people who have put those who work in the movie industry in the category of nonpeople according to your brilliant logic i dont find that particularly funny it is sad luckily for most of us life is slightly more nuanced nah theres no nuance at all youre just a horrible person who justifies his horribleness by claiming that the world is a horrible place if you died would it matter at all would anyone but your immediate family and friends miss you would you just be another anonymous name amongst the ledgers of the history books someone who someone is like oh they were related to me and then spends a few minutes looking at your birth certificate before moving on to someone else
nottheonion,removed,please tell me this is werner

nottheonion,removed,most dietitians huh here just read this httpwwwtheiflifecomeatingmoremealsdoesnotspeedupyourmetabolism
nottheonion,removed,no its because youre still in a caloric deficit
nottheonion,removed,glad to hear it
nottheonion,removed,which is really easy to do
nottheonion,removed,yeah exercise to burn calories is a lot harder than it is to eat calories but to walk that much with that much weight im curious to see his joints
nottheonion,removed,thats not how steps or gravity works every step you are lifting your entire body weight on alternating legs otherwise you wouldnt be going up the fucking stairs

nottheonion,removed,why no mention of their skin color you sure love to mention it on other accounts when the people are victims of police but no mention here
nottheonion,removed,this just misses the mark i can criticize accurately and be inferior thats perfectly possible if anything i was just being a trolling jerk
nottheonion,removed,i recently watched a video of this man take potshots at his neighbors
nottheonion,removed,for you thats obviously opinion and nothing more
nottheonion,removed,no thats a stupid fucking gimmick and everyone knows it
nottheonion,removed,ugh man everyone is getting raped and i cant even get a kiss
nottheonion,removed,finally we can start raping again the unnatural bias against it is over
nottheonion,removed,sounds like he got railroaded i bet he was drunk too but they didnt charge the girl with rape i feel for the guy i hope he can put his life together after this
nottheonion,removed,how is he a creep when the girls arent are they not fully functioning adults making decisions for themselves if they were all drunk then what crime has occurred hes the only victim i see here
nottheonion,removed,its payback if its against whites they deserve it because there ancestors destroyed the middle east
nottheonion,removed,what do you think when you let muslim immigrants invade our country they not only invade with their people but also their draconian thought processes in middle east countries rape is not a crime and it seems like the us is getting closer and closer to that
nottheonion,removed,they were both drunk and recall nothing so lets blame the man
nottheonion,removed,atta boy
nottheonion,removed,so shall we see if the media is predictable since the story didnt mention race they were black otherwise the story would have said they were white just sayin
nottheonion,removed,mods have chosen to delete comments here that mention the suspects were black article
nottheonion,removed,this is horrible years old has a one year old at home is three months pregnant and working at wendys she is only two years away from being a mother of four and running an illegal daycare out of her moms place
nottheonion,removed,congrats folks youve done it the country is so affraid that they no longer list the race of a suspect also where is the babys daddy
nottheonion,removed,news did not give a description we all know what that tells us
nottheonion,removed,rapes for the price of one
nottheonion,removed,call it like it is hate crime you know they were black
nottheonion,removed,the united states would have one of the lowest crime rates in the world if you exclude the crime committed by blacks and hispanics its sickening to read these articles about the crime they commit their culture revels in and admires violence plus the warrior gene maoa makes them more aggressive
nottheonion,removed,its actually shrinking not growing according to most statistics
nottheonion,removed,please dont let them be black people please dont let them be black people please dont let them be black people the report states a witness told police she said repine was pulled through the window by two black females aw crap
nottheonion,removed,savages
nottheonion,removed,honestly if they did this to my pregnant daughter id figure out who they were one way or another and make sure one by one eventually they would all be getting the rest of their meals through a straw or tube
nottheonion,removed,is true that in texas you can shoot mexicans at the border and wont go to jail
nottheonion,removed,tell black people to stop committing crime and the news to stop pretending its not a major problem its not some conspiracy against blacks nobody singles out asians or indians because they dont commit a crazy amount of crime
nottheonion,removed,how can they have a live and description but no arrests
nottheonion,removed,anyone else disappointed that the actual fight wasnt in the video
nottheonion,removed,wtf i was expecting video of the attack whats ripoff
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,lmol is this the onin irl
nottheonion,removed,if only saint basil along with kremlin would get blasted into space irl
nottheonion,removed,no it is a joke you just didnt get it
nottheonion,removed,what is the chances it was an obama voter
nottheonion,removed,i think they might be referring to canadianstyle hate speech laws see in canada you can preach hateful things that would otherwise get you arrested for inciting violence as long as you claim sincere religious beliefs in those views this is the same reason why animal cruelty laws apply for everyone except those who claim sincere religious beliefs in a slaughter ritual that make the animal suffer needlessly
nottheonion,removed,offend yeah shooting offending its called brutally murdering
nottheonion,removed,thank god this brave citizen had a gun so he could defend himself against the taco bell
nottheonion,removed,im glad nobody has said anything racist people just know
nottheonion,removed,wouldnt surprise me if it was blacks milwaukee is nearly half black vs whites goes with the other story from earlier about the fine young black ladies attacked a pregnant teenager over some straws unless youre completely ignorant youll know that on black people can be quicker to temper and take offense easier than your average white person keeping it real has no place in western society these people have no respect for other people and their culture condition them that they should react to situations they disagree with aggressively of course most african americans dont even fall into the above category but its still magnitudes higher than that of any other poor population in the us hispanics from all over central america flood into the us as poor illegal immigrants trying to make it but you dont see anywhere to the same amount of violence among them where as in brazil which had a high former slave population that mingled with the locals and created modern brazilians they are notoriously hyperviolent compared to less mixed poor hispanic populations at this point youll probably consider me a bigot or whatever but i never judge any individual i meet on anything other than his personality and dealings with me there is no prejudice im just trying to interpret the world through the data it gives me some dog breeds are more aggressive than others
nottheonion,removed,so black women beatup a pregnant black woman over straws at a wendys anybody want to try and guess the color of the person who shot at someone over forgotten sour cream
nottheonion,removed,if only restaurants were allowed to ban all blacks from ordering
nottheonion,removed,yes it does african americans voted for obama just because he was black im assuming the man who shot up taco bell was african american i didnt read the article or even care to do so just seeing how riled up you idiots are getting
nottheonion,removed,e
nottheonion,removed,enrr
nottheonion,removed,yep we keep having to park farther and farther away men are literally having to go sit in the back for shit we arent responsible for
nottheonion,removed,you are also sol if you become homeless or a victim of domestic violence as help centers for these issues are readily available for women but generally not for men
nottheonion,removed,man i dont want a bad night and you dont want to be a bad guy
nottheonion,removed,id say men just accept it and deal with it stoically as this is expected of them and they dont have the but im helpless excuse cause you knowtheyre men were supposed to be able to take care of ourselves
nottheonion,removed,were no fearless were just men about it jokesaboutgenderroles
nottheonion,removed,we can run like of them time while a significant percentage of women wear heels fighting is a terrible idea
nottheonion,removed,yet we are utterly fearless the word youre looking for is expendable male victims be it for crime poverty cancer just arent considered important
nottheonion,removed,get a carry permit a gun and learn how to use it anyone can fight back
nottheonion,removed,asians are such bad drivers i swear pearl harbor could have been an accident
nottheonion,removed,law doesnt see it that way and youll servce jail time for it which will screw your life over job wise
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,no we really dont care and can solve our own problems let the women do what they specialize in outrage
nottheonion,removed,not fearless but prepared as a man should be
nottheonion,removed,oh sorry i thought i was in the thread about germanys recent massmolestation at a music festival whoops
nottheonion,removed,it doesnt say anythng about random attacks assault by strangers can happen in many contexts including an escelated argument or a rowdy sporting event or bar i think men are likley to be more involved or present in these situations and thus may be more prone to being assaulted i think the kind of attack one would expect to take place in a parking lot is a premeditated sneak attack which could be a robbery or a rape the latter is certainly more likely to involve a woman so this may not be so offbase by the way mean make up a large majority of those in institutional settings so its not that surprising they are the majority of sexual assaults in that setting
nottheonion,removed,im in an argument with a guy right now who has used the men are bigger than women trope to explain that women generally dont stand a chance whats interesting is that the size difference between men has never phased him as if all men are on an equal footing by virtue of being men
nottheonion,removed,yeah that doesnt read right no idea how i managed that
nottheonion,removed,but the majority of victims of sexual violence are women so its not that strange
nottheonion,removed,of course we are we have to walk to the dark parking spaces to retrieve our vehicle easy target
nottheonion,removed,pretty much every human who ever lived before about years ago
nottheonion,removed,yeah its not because women are bad drivers its because kebab is robbing and raping germany for lulz
nottheonion,removed,not fearless just disposable
nottheonion,removed,so they arent gang raped by muslims

nottheonion,removed,is it sexist to not provide larger spots for women because they need them to have an equal opportunity at parking or is it sexist to provide the spots on general principle you be the trigger
nottheonion,removed,if this happens to america it wouldnt even be a problem because suddenly i identify as a woman as soon as i get in to my parking spot
nottheonion,removed,high five
nottheonion,removed,soak a nigga like he in a tub
nottheonion,removed,do they have transgender parking
nottheonion,removed,you dont know me you dont know what work ive done no matter what country youre born in you still have to work harder than everyone else around you to make it lol bullshit youre living entitled proof
nottheonion,removed,doesnt take genius to know women really are bad drivers combined that with being asian it only makes them worse
nottheonion,removed,funny how this article spins this as sexist towards women somehow giving women more rights then men is still sexist against women and no its not sexist to say women as a population have a harder time parking than men its been proven scientifically everyone should be treated with the same amount of respect but that doesnt mean we are all perfectly equal in capabilities oh wait i forgot its impossible to be sexist towards men because patriarchy right grow the fuck up already
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,saudi arabia doesnt have this problem
nottheonion,removed,this isnt the first time parking lots have been accused of sexism modern social justice

nottheonion,removed,i want one for pathetic people like me
nottheonion,removed,and in america men can park in them and claim they are women
nottheonion,removed,i literally need better qualifications and work experience to get a job or promotion a black person with a college degree has the same employment opportunities as a white high school dropout white felons have a higher chance of getting called back or hired than blacks without those programs dont exist to give blacks more opportunities than whites they exist to give them the same opportunities per their qualifications the reverse is in order for asian immigrants schools often have an asian ceiling where they will stop accepting better qualified asians and instead accept whites because asians are too represented asians are also less likely to get promoted with better experience qualifications and education
nottheonion,removed,nono femaleonly spaces are sexist unless females want them then they are not
nottheonion,removed,so how would target rule on this
nottheonion,removed,are transgendered people allowed to park there

nottheonion,removed,just like overwatch am i right
nottheonion,removed,i dont know the mods are crazy
nottheonion,removed,those arent all facts and many psychologists and psychiatrists still say its a mental disorder because it is not all mental disorders are bad things its just a disorder that only affects a very small minority of people and probably doesnt harm others even though is may hurt the trans person leading them to high levels of suicide how can gender not be a want and be a need the opinions you subscribe to say gender is fluid so how can you need to undergo years long processes of trying to make yourself appear to be the opposite sex also cis is completely worthless term for normal and was created by people obsessed with labels to divide people how do i know this i self identify as an apache attack helicopter the normal kind of course
nottheonion,removed,men are biologically men no matter what same with women no amount of cutting and meds changes that
nottheonion,removed,although funny its kind of true in a figurative way as well despite the joke that vegans will always tell you my facebook feed is full of meat eating loudmouths that act like the act of eating meat which including myself is somehow threatened ive seen people post pseudoscientific antivegan propaganda and are completely serious about it granted most of them are my big fat dumbass cousins but still my vegan friends and family members never really bring it up
nottheonion,removed,fyi this is not out of context its literally what she thinks
nottheonion,removed,ah the old naturalist fallacy reminiscent of the nonarguments id see on my facebook feed whenever people get bored enough to feign outrage at a group that no one really cares about

nottheonion,removed,dont you know reddit has decided that sexism doesnt exist any more wage gaps are a myth we as women beat sexism when we stopped being property and got the right to vote duh

nottheonion,removed,this is also the bureau of justice statistics saying that httpswwwquoracomwhatisthedifferenceincrimerateinruralandurbanareas were talking about violent crime here not property damage etc again your looking at a table of statistics and not taking every factor into considerationthings like poverty level of income education availability of good education etc youre only cherry picking the numbers that fit your narrative which is exactly what the fbi says not to do for my own amusement and because its relevant againill repost this but anyway have fun with it youre clearly not looking at any of the links i provide or ignoring themwhich is worse youre picking small relatively unimportant parts of my posts apart looking for problems and ignoring the greater issue which you seem to be very good at
nottheonion,removed,shit like this makes me care just that much less when i hear about slain cops they almost deserve it

nottheonion,removed,i dont think it i know it it was a federally mandated part of the no child left behind changes it is a by product of the helicopter mom society that you dont like it is your problem its no a stereotype just because you are incapable of hearing something critical about yourself and frankly this is exactly what im talking about junior
nottheonion,removed,again the main point of your argument is lets give up on detroit and take away all federal aid thats certainly not going to help the problem

nottheonion,removed,all of your posts have insinuated that black people are responsible for all or most crimes everything youve focused on has been based on a negative stereotype of black people you ignore the crimes that cause poverty and only want to discuss the crimes that you can only quote black stats on do you really not see how our limited conversation would make you look racist i was just making a statement racist isnt an insult its just an adjective that applies to many of the people who only know that stats your posting you arent talking about the asian crime rate white crime or anything else you only jump in with crime stats the topic at hand was whether or not members of the various groups cops judges corrections officers bank loan managers etc are being held back and discriminated against but you cant even discuss that you are only interested in telling me repeatedly that black people are criminals have you noticed that yet
nottheonion,removed,what why this discussing the fact that they might be lying a different topic this post is literally about the story they told so questioning it here is about as on topic as i can imagine

nottheonion,removed,when rpolitics got all their new mods a year ago and turned into rhillary becoming an echochamber for the left all the rightwing supporters went to runcensorednews which is now a rightwing echochamber this probably wouldnt have happened if both sides would just talk and debate without trash talking each other discourse is the catalyst of change after all

nottheonion,removed,no per capita russian gdp is a stable upwards growth with very few dips in the statistical line donald and hillary are not perfect candidates both have outrageous scandals under their belts and trumps past of not paying taxes is one of the big reasons i nearly did not vote for him i am not a blind trump supporter i recognize his many faults my biggest issue with him is definitely environmental but in the end his policies of economic protectionism and willingness to step down from our current hyperinterventionalist foreign policy made me vote for him and he may be a hypocrite on taxes but in the end the macro effect is the same if you are an immigrant of any kind you should absolutely have to go through the immigration process it isnt racism its the law
nottheonion,removed,sigh the edge is you pretending you know anything about me or what i know about pipelines what i do know based on your comment that pipelines are objectively safer than any other method of oil transport is that you dont know what the fuck you are talking about the primary reason i know this is because you are likely relying on statements from like fraser institute without realizing that it was referring to canada or understanding the fact that pipelines in the us have next to no regulation and the regulation that does exists is laughable before you can inspect the facility the inspector has to give days notice see usc violate the law you might get a warning oh noooo create a massive leak you get a fine case total economic devastation you get a fine of per day oh right i forgot that fine cant exceed million so you can only really be fined grand per day for like a week then you cant get any more fines for that accident fuck all if it takes you days to stop oh and that fine yeah you are a terrible fucking person and the worst violator out there the fine will likely be lowered to ensure you can continue operation see usc govt has to consider whether the fine will impact your ability to continue operations moreover the equation is often made about the pipeline safety claim to that of airplanes and cars yes it is safer to fly than to drive but when planes crash everyone most of the time dies cars are more survivable train derailments create minimum economic impact vs kalamazoo river incident in other words you seem like you are some low level oil industry employee who is spoon fed information from your superiors and have conducted no independent investigation at all

nottheonion,removed,it sounds to me like there is a reaction to this shes not getting a free pass maybe things are different in your school or neighborhood and students actively seek out difference at all times so thats why you think im so wrong i envy you for your experience but your experience is not the norm what i am describing in my comment above is selfsegregation on campus is a widespread phenomenon thats all i am talking about students tend to want to live and hang out with others like themselves its not just black students white students too engineering students jewish students farm kids and even if a kid isnt tactless enough to put it in a roommate ad like this i only want to live with a lowincome kid like myself or i only want to live with other hispanics or insert group here chances are when they meet and screen for prospective roommates theyre going to lean that way and yes white kids do this too thats why i dont blame her for wanting to live with people like her thats fairly normal based on widespread evidence the way she puts it however and her decision to include it in her ad is not wise and possibly it was deliberately designed to get herself media attention i will not address this comment because its beneath this community black people come from neighborhoods that are usually crime ridden and violent

nottheonion,removed,because it impacts a lot of treatment options doctors will often assess pregnancy risk by asking several questions recent cycle sexual activity might be annoying to someone who doesnt have sex with men knowing that the odds of pregnancy are about seems to be useful information to keep track of perhaps in a less silly way
nottheonion,removed,this is weird because lesbians are less mentally ill than normal women

nottheonion,removed,i think that was a terrible thing for someone to put on that mans medical chart
nottheonion,removed,unless she tried to hit on her female doctor or any of the nurses too hard
nottheonion,removed,what is your sexual preference check all that apply straight mental illness mental illness mental illness
nottheonion,removed,if one is homosexual by nature rather than by nurture then it should be included in the icd international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems so that it can be researched with respect to other codes eg are homosexuals more prone to also having a diagnosis of struck by duck subsequent encounter if homosexuality is stricken from the then that would be an acknowledgement that it is a behavior rather than a condition if it is a behavior then it should be possible to pray out the gay being upset about this is a double edged sword

nottheonion,removed,because it is a medical condition you dont find the biologically opposite gender sexually attractive ie you have a disability
nottheonion,removed,sexual orientation that doesnt comply to your gender is a mental disorder in the medical definition of the term
nottheonion,removed,follow the drs order take cocks tid x days
nottheonion,removed,to be fair homosexuality is an aberration
nottheonion,removed,its a livable illness homosexuality in general

nottheonion,removed,no definitely its junk science you cant electrocute someone into changing their sexual orientation and youre a fucking idiot if you give it even the slightest of credence
nottheonion,removed,well there is a much higher rate of mental illness in the homo community so it pretty much is a warning sign
nottheonion,removed,get over yourself
nottheonion,removed,seems about par for the course in terms of mental illnesses
nottheonion,removed,actually it is a medical condition though so is transgender which is disassociation manic identity disorder
nottheonion,removed,yes it is
nottheonion,removed,but it is whats the big deal its just like how being gay is a medical condition
nottheonion,removed,i dont think the neurology of sexuality is a closed case just let them do what they want to do add queerhetero to that rainbow if its not already there then pass the blunt and blaze it straggot

nottheonion,removed,i would say any mentality which leads to the extinction of human kind should be a concern yes
nottheonion,removed,that makes a sort of sense but its still retarded its better to just be direct and not worry so much if he doesnt know shes homosexual and asks her a question about being with a man so what she can say no im gay i dont sleep with men and they can go on
nottheonion,removed,pffft go fuck yourself like this doctornurses bad decision reflects upon america as a whole or somehow makes america comparable to nk and fuck the general antiamerican sentiment that this site is obsessed with ohhh someone said something wrong rip america were done for shut it down our attempts at progress have failed woe are we
nottheonion,removed,on a biological level it is a mental disorder why would a species produce offspring who will not procreate im not saying its wrong im saying it is a disorder in the brain we have a sex drive to further the species if that sex drive doesnt lead to procreation there is an imbalance
nottheonion,removed,a mental disorder does not have to cause harm at all there are many mental disorders that give the person an edge in society
nottheonion,removed,what if i love my dog or my sister or my mother i guess i should be able to hop in the sack with them because i love them i am not against love whatsoever just deviant sexual practice that is detrimental to society in general if someone murders an innocent child on the other side of the world it has no impact on my life whatsoever and doesnt hurt me either but im still against murdering innocent children i think you have perhaps expanded your mind so widely that it has fallen out
nottheonion,removed,you are dense as fuck mate
nottheonion,removed,because it is
nottheonion,removed,but it is a mental disorder not lethal in most cases but still a mental disorder
nottheonion,removed,well from a technical standpoint lesbianism is a mental health issue same as transexual and other sexual orientations other than heterosexual does that mean i dont like people who arent hetero no does this mean i think this needs to stop and every one should be hetero no are you a bad person if your not hetero no
nottheonion,removed,good lol its a mental illness after all
nottheonion,removed,its not wrong it is a serious health condition
nottheonion,removed,considering domestic violence among lesbian they might be on to something here
nottheonion,removed,well it is a mental disorder
nottheonion,removed,what an awful human being you are
nottheonion,removed,just like lesbianism liberalism is a mental disorder we need to address this just like depression and addiction all three are rampant in society today
nottheonion,removed,ive been a lifelong sufferer of this disease lesbianism is no joke a propensity towards flannel my dog and cat dark framed glasses shavedonthesides haircut its debilitating i am thinking of starting a gofundme
nottheonion,removed,to be fair there are lots of conditions for which we have no cure
nottheonion,removed,well shit guess which duo in a relationship has the number spot for spousal abuse lesbians is it a mental disorder well they literally beat each other up the most so why rule it out oh right because if we as americans start looking more into these issues of gays or trans people as mental health concerns then all of the sudden were the bad guys much better to ignore anything about mental health as it is truly the american way
nottheonion,removed,well shit guess which duo in a relationship has the number spot for spousal abuse lesbians is it a mental disorder well they literally beat each other up the most so why rule it out oh right because if we as americans start looking more into these issues of gays or trans people as mental health concerns then all of the sudden were the bad guys much better to ignore anything about mental health as it is truly the american way

nottheonion,removed,its unfortunate that we dont consider homosexuality to be a condition unfortunately the medical community and people in general have been bullied into ignoring the reality because of this we dont do do research into the causes of homosexuality if it can be prevented and if it can be remedied for people whos homosexuality doesnt align with their own personal self image its pretty callous to just say yep thats the way you were born cant do anything for you we are largely able to ignore it since only a relatively small portion of the population is homosexual but if of children were being born homosexual i think a lot of people would reconsider their position on whether it was a condition or not
nottheonion,removed,unpopular opinion sexual preferences other than heterosexual are either a choice or a mental disorder than being said bangmarry whoeverwhatever gets you off i couldnt care less
nottheonion,removed,silly doctor lesbianism is a mental defect not a physical one
nottheonion,removed,well duh it is a mental disease that goes against human instinct to reproduce
nottheonion,removed,dont you think youre overreacting just a little bit you feminist skull fucking moron
nottheonion,removed,true but sterility isnt a problem for humans either and yet we still consider it a condition and do research to prevent and correct it even if in most cases there is no cure i think people have just deluded themselves on this issue because homosexuals were treated so badly in the past and theyre overcompensating now
nottheonion,removed,the last obgyn i was on a rotation with gives fucks about what youre going to say to her about how youre not pregnant it took one uterine biopsy with a pathology report of fetal tissue to guarantee her never to do that again
nottheonion,removed,definitely a mental illness
nottheonion,removed,i hope you are never allowed to procreate because the amount of stupid you have should end with you
nottheonion,removed,its pretty arrogant to claim there are no homosexuals that would rather not be homosexual or that there arent parent who would rather their child not be homosexual again conditions dont always have cures but they always have causes knowing the causes can help prevent them homosexuality may not be a mental disorder it may be far more physiological than that we just dont know because in many states doctors arent able to research the issue and even in states where research would be allowed public opinion towards the issue is so irrational that doctors wont
nottheonion,removed,its medically relevant and everyone here is angry for no reason other than they enjoy being angry
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,be careful commenting here if you say anything about genetics or science you will lose karma only type things they like for free karma copy and paste this people dont choose to be gay so its not a disorder science gay treatment facilities to differ is homophobic reproduction is irrelevant end comment do not type anything about the fact that a trait that doesnt let an animal reproduce is a disorder
nottheonion,removed,theres nothing antiscience or alternative facts about listing lesbianism as a condition it would be antiscience not to list it as one doesnt mean theres anything wrong with being gay it just isnt normal
nottheonion,removed,its an accepted mental disorder so what
nottheonion,removed,good
nottheonion,removed,wellits pretty obvious your dont need to go to med school to see that
nottheonion,removed,well theyre not wrong
nottheonion,removed,im just here to see how deep uelaan is going to dig this hole he clearly didnt expect anyone to challenge the logic of his post
nottheonion,removed,its a mental condition
nottheonion,removed,i fucking hope your parents were gay instead of giving birth to this dirty piece of utter fucking shit
nottheonion,removed,only because people get upset by that it clearly is a mental disorder whether you believe in evolution creation whatever it is just not compatible
nottheonion,removed,huh i wonder if she can file for state disability for that
nottheonion,removed,they are not
nottheonion,removed,yup being gay is natural as in its a genetic condition but its definitely not normal claiming its normal is like saying someone with austism is normal now i dont have a personal problem with it because they dont really harm anyone and theyre not going to pass on their genes lol but saying its normal is as stupid as saying there are more than genders
nottheonion,removed,before the dsm become politicized it did indeed classify homosexuality as a mental disorder
nottheonion,removed,like if you think this is good

nottheonion,removed,tell me this what scientific breakthrough lead the dsm to stop classifying homosexuality as a mental illness
nottheonion,removed,well i tried to teach you to read okay here lets try a different way i know youre just going to be dishonest about it to prove your point but hey whatever worth a try lets say i said the following im going to lock up all the criminals including in your view i didnt just call you a criminal in reality read by a person who understands english and doesnt have an agenda i did do you understand now
nottheonion,removed,good
nottheonion,removed,sadly you are misinformed allow me to explain there was no scientific breakthrough that caused the dsm to remove homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses homosexuality was is and will always be a mental illness the only reason that the dsm removed homosexuality is because of pressure from the gay community in other words it wasnt science that influenced the dsms decision to remove homosexuality it was threats and intimidation from gay bullies to pretend that homosexuality isnt a mental illness and to cite the current dsm as a source for this is to ignore the facts and let me be clear you are entitled to your own opinions you are not however entitled to your own facts

nottheonion,removed,meanwhile a million muslims marched into germany and celebrated new years by attacking and raping german women on in ten different german cities a number of women became pregnant after these attacks and sought abortions so japan can import muslim refugees to decrease the number of virgins and get more women pregnant during the japanese army kidnapped hundreds of thousands of women to use as sex slaves i guess their desires have changed or they are more excited when raping slaves than having equal relations with a woman

nottheonion,removed,what facts you have not said anything factual at all you must be trying to give trump a run for his money in the dumbassery department or youre trolling
nottheonion,removed,trump does appeal to a lot of white supremacists and hillary clinton appeals to a lot of black livs matter terrorists and cop killers that doesnt mean she is advocating it wise up i really dont care what david duke says damn youre foolish

nottheonion,removed,that question rather conclusively demonstrates your utter ignorance in these matters good day
nottheonion,removed,really thats it i am so disappointed
nottheonion,removed,okay then go to donald trumps politifact page and point out what mistakes they did wrong about saying his statements are false ive done a bit of digging and as far as i can tell theyre pretty much on point with trump im not sure you understand what was meant by the how and why i dont deny that every mistake of trumps they pointed out was probably a mistake the issue is with their methodology and their motivation if a democrat can get a half true for mistaken statistics but a republican gets a false for mistaken statistics its not enough for you to simply say well his stats were wrong so they arent bias you have to acknowledge the complete double standard in how the mistake is dealt with its like me punishing two children for stealing cookies by beating one with a belt and giving the other a stern wag of the finger that is not fair or equal treatment and me saying but technically i punished both does not make my actions any less unfair women on average do make cents for every dollar a man makes the less pay for equal work is the myth not the gap itself yes youre making my point for me it is all in the delivery had a republican said something equivalent the response would have been mostly false cents is the biggest gap not the only one its all in the spin i think youre really struggling with the notion that you can be honest about someone lying while still being dishonest in how you portray it you seem to keep repeating well that republican did get the stats wrong while ignoring that democrats get a pass for exactly the same thing ted cruz did just inflate transgender girls to being boys which is honestly a blatantly false and unscientific belief the apa american psychologist association confirmed decades ago that transgender identity is legitimate ted cruz calling a transgender girl a boy is the equivalent of a politician saying were letting mentally ill people serve in the armed forces im not sure how you can inflate a transgender girl into a boy are they like balloons and once again had ted cruz been a democrat he wouldve gotten a half true for that statement as im sure you know the law does not require any proof of gender dysphoria thus it is quite easy to imagine any boy or man walking into the girls restroom as we are now wholly incapable of refusing them that was cruzs point not that transgenders dont exist but that according to the language of the law any boy could simply walk into the girls shower conservatives on politifact are judged by the worst possible interpretation while liberals are given the best possible interpretation that is the very definition of bias its not politifacts fault that republicans are more reckless than democrats with their statements the irony of discussing bias with someone who is so biased its not that politifact is a left leaning openly biased site its that republicans are just worse liars good lord there is nothing more reckless when trump got unemployment numbers wrong he got a false when bernie got them wrong he got a half true like god i pity you youre so narrow minded and ideological that you cant see things staring you straight in the face because that would require admitting youre as flawed as the other guy oh im not denying that poltifact has a left wing bias im denying that their biased enough that their fact gathering is completely unreliable well thank god thats all i wanted to hear and i have never suggested it was completely unreliable only that it was biased and thus should be approached with caution as i have repeatedly stated its not enough to says someone lied its all in how you judge that lie and present it politifact does not treat right and left lies equally oh right methodology i hate to break it to you but methodology is extremely important you hate to break it to me who on earth are you discussing this with i have said from the start that one of the problems with politifact is their methodology not in how they research but in what they choose to research and how the choose to spin the findings also the difference between breitbart and poltifact is well huge yes theyre media sources but poltifact is an award winning news organization thats highly considered in the media to be a good source of news breitbart is a considered to be the rightwing equivalent to buzzfeed id never use buzzfeed as a source against donald trump because i now buzzfeed is shit im not sure who would consider breitbart equivalent to buzzfeed other than someone who has read neither beyond that i always get a kick out the prize winning defense by liberals you mean the media apparatus which is almost entirely liberal awarded other liberals its a bit like the oscars you have left wingers handing prizes to left wingers while applauding the intelligence and bravery of left wingers its a bit rich and certainly humorous but i think you ought to judge what is produced not how many trophies they have from like minded individuals i mean shit at the very least people need to learn how to investigate information themselves if a person is unable to investigate and tell the difference between shoddy journalism with a political bias and good journalism with a political bias then honestly they need to some serious selfevaluations about their political beliefs and the media they consume heres something we can agree on
nottheonion,removed,youre mad you cant just walk into the white house with no experience and do a good job evidence of that is barack obama who was a senator for a grand total of days before running for president you are seriously living in a fantasy land where republicans are all terrible for ex post facto reasons and democrats are fantastic because of some other similarly dubious justification what applies for republicans doesnt apply for democrats youre a living breathing contradiction you didnt want to talk about trumps lies huh he lies more than hillary and thats saying something theres nothing to talk about you make a baseless assertion i dont have to say anything in response the sky is blue i guess simply espousing falsehoods without any justification is not a discussion just like every other polictician youve been sold a lie and youre buying into it like a fool nobody repeat nobody has a fucking clue what youre talking about what lie have politicians been sold youre incredibly foolish
nottheonion,removed,if that fucking asshole obama shot himself id laugh the guys a traitor and needs his guts seperated from his body

nottheonion,removed,lmao youre just mad that i was right and youre a fucking dumbass keep crying the tears are tasty
nottheonion,removed,except that most comments about israel coming out of trumps mouth have been either supportive or balanced very little bad has been said by trump that can come across as antisemitic and even then its been mostly directed at a person much like the other misplaced things he has said a lot of people here are portraying trump as the biggest antisemite here if that was true then why would he have such a close relationship with his daughter who may i remind you converted to judaism dont forget that trump is one of the few politicians of such gravity that have openly supported israels expansion of settlements into palestinian territory i can dig more but its honestly not worth it to pander to butthurt libtards
nottheonion,removed,well hes talking about overturning roe v wade is that enough and even then what would you be protesting his points of view ok thats a good thing to protestbut the kids protesting trumps win is the most ridiculous thing ive seen this season what are they protesting half of them didnt even fucking vote its like living in the dark ages not knowing how to hunt then when the hunters return with the kill you dont like the taste of the meat so you dont eat and protest that youre hungry bitch you cant hunt and you complaining gtfoh
nottheonion,removed,years ago i went to bang a lady that apparently had one of these and it cut my dick open have heard similar stories from other guys

nottheonion,removed,christ on a cracker 😂
nottheonion,removed,some debate whether he truly is a billionaire no one knows his true net worth but part of the claim for his wealth is valuing his namebrand at several billion dollars donald j trump the controversial real estate mogul and republican presidential candidate has openly boasted about a net wealth of more than billion forbes stated his actual net wealth was closer to billion while the bloomberg billionaires index came in with a billion figure because he inherited so much and he self promoted so much people are quick to get in bed with him for new business after new business just to have his name on it despite past failures and when he doesnt pay his bills he often gets away with it nothing he has done however has demonstrated particular business savvy lets flip the script and say this was mark cuban instead who was elected as a nonpolitician by the gop cuban is also a billionaire who likes to speak his mind and has never been a politician before but id argue that cuban has demonstrated great business savvy repeatedly and is truly a selfmade man trump is no cuban

nottheonion,removed,so why arent they fleeing to mexico
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiduluthmodel the feminist theory underlying the duluth model is that men use violence within relationships to exercise power and control this is illustrated by the power and control wheel a graphic typically displayed as a poster in participating locations according to the duluth model women and children are vulnerable to violence because of their unequal social economic and political status in society feminists who believe this shit are fucking satan
nottheonion,removed,how so people do things in the heat of moment thats why its a specific crime that they wouldnt normally do it cant hurt to have them locked away to not risk escalating it
nottheonion,removed,her husband is a cop so i think it just happened to be left out im not saying it was good but i dont think most people would have a gun out and in the open regularly
nottheonion,removed,when she was shooting the gun she was probably yelling stop hitting me stop beating my face with your fist
nottheonion,removed,so did i miss the announcement that today was sexism is dead women suck day
nottheonion,removed,or maybe its the prosecution knowing that an attempted murder charge is going to be difficult to do because proving intent is difficult
nottheonion,removed,no irony at all really you see only men can perpetrate domestic violence so by trying to shoot him she was trying to prevent domestic violence
nottheonion,removed,prosecution probably doesnt have enough to hit her with attempted murder
nottheonion,removed,i think you missed his point it should never be considered a best practice for the future because if you think your spouse is capable of shooting at you during an argument you should probably leave that relationship immediately
nottheonion,removed,so its generally accurate with a few exceptions
nottheonion,removed,anything as long as personal responsibility is avoided thats the new thing its not your fault its cultures fault youre just a victim of culture
nottheonion,removed,youre not really helping the case that feminists are moderate when youre a marxist and unironically link to thinkprogress and rainn in your other comments
nottheonion,removed,i dont understand why its not egalitarianism ive had this rhetorical argument way too many times and i always put my foot in my mouth because like ooooooooooo peoples beliefs are so important they hold them dear we cant possibly question them in an effort to understand them feminism equality so why call it feminism because its important to women that everyone realizes that women created the equality it wasnt a compromise so its literally impossible to call it egalitarianism even though you have to do way less rhetorical backflipping through flaming hoops to get there do you realize how much easier it would be to recruit people to the same belief structure if it was just called something else and dont give me history as a defense things evolve to get more effective all the time whats the goal really true equality or equality championed by women seems like you should go after equality rather than including the fem stamp of approval in the word but what do i know im just some nihilist asshole
nottheonion,removed,internalized misogyny is when a woman disagrees with a feminists political beliefs
nottheonion,removed,no because some stereotypes are inaccurate your comment said by redditors who have never actually met feminists and i told you ive met plenty of feminists is a thing and now youre saying is a stereotype and therefore its just like all other stereotypes that makes no sense
nottheonion,removed,i dont know the discrimination against white men is huge we are dirt we are whats wrong with everything we are all racistsexist whites the only race that is racist and only the males are racist a white man that hangs drywall is as complicit as bernie madoff and as complacent as a slave owner white men are all in it together if a white man calls someone out for cutting line they being rude and entitled if a white man shows interest in a woman its optionally sexual harassment just a white man doing that white man shit again im not saying others dont have it hard but i assure you being a white man has its own set of victimizations and they are far from trivial basically we are everyone elses punching bags heavy on psychology oh and if a white man points this out he has automatically lost his right to being heard
nottheonion,removed,the thing is there never is an easy solution to heavily debated issues saying that feminists should look at themselves to solve misogyny is just as insufficient as saying that feminists should look at men to solve misogyny feminism or rather the issues feminism tries to address is a complex topic with lots of layers in different areas some of which are deeply embedded in our social structure and therefore hard to tackle
nottheonion,removed,the feminist rolemodel right there
nottheonion,removed,so a bus is too small a group what about a town with majority black population a state country where do you draw your arbitrary line
nottheonion,removed,theyre ideologies which shape the world we live in today powerful world leaders barack obama justin trudeau many more frequently use feminist mythology in their rhetoric wage gap rape culture many more reddit is supposed to be a forum for the free and open exchange of ideas and information so im really not sure why have something against that unless maybe but maybe not no accusations youre a feminist who just gets upset when your narrative gets dismantled of course like i said im not trying to accuse it just doesnt make sense to me otherwise
nottheonion,removed,hopefully jezebel goes down with gawker
nottheonion,removed,shit like this is why im not a feminist
nottheonion,removed,stupid misogynists women are incapable of domestic violence feminism oh and s
nottheonion,removed,i think ive met this person before this is archive page of their its obvious they dont believe that shitty srs tactics and once you call them out theyll delete this account move to another account and continue to spread their cancer
nottheonion,removed,to be expected but youd never guess it if you listen to feminists wholl blame the patriarchy and white males all day long
nottheonion,removed,is that internalized matriarchy
nottheonion,removed,this guy makes me realize how fucking awful women are not all but a really large majority
nottheonion,removed,at least she had a gun lying around totally need that shit for self defense
nottheonion,removed,please stop this why do you do this i called you out last time you deleted your account now youre back at it again youre sick get help heres an archive of your old account
nottheonion,removed,i mean nobody thanks white people for ending racism and passing antidiscrimination laws
nottheonion,removed,how do you know
nottheonion,removed,well on the other hand ive never seen anyone make fun of someone for enjoying cooking
nottheonion,removed,what the fuck
nottheonion,removed,til race is the same as ideology
nottheonion,removed,lots of woman use the violence against women campaign and safe houses as a protection for them to continue violence and abuse on men
nottheonion,removed,haha i think you forgot the s thats why you might be getting the downvotes
nottheonion,removed,if youre ever so upset with someone and in such an intense argument that either party shooting the other becomes a remote ability youve made a massive mistake in the relationship a long time before that if youre that worried about an argument erupting into violence you should also lock up any knives hammers or other heavysharp objects statistically firearms are significantly less likely to be used in domestic violence than most other types of weapons
nottheonion,removed,she must be a campus feminist
nottheonion,removed,no because im ok with generalizations theyre useful and make sense but im not going to use them when they benefit me then cry when someone uses them against me
nottheonion,removed,i cant believe it is years for shooting a matress
nottheonion,removed,sounds like a normal day for feminism
nottheonion,removed,yeah this individual hypocrite sure does show that the entire movement is hypocritical huh
nottheonion,removed,feminists on the internet tend to be quite a different variety
nottheonion,removed,you realise youre attempting to justify the original point by referencing an argument you disagree with right youre saying its okay to use this wrong argument because people i disagree with have used the same wrong argument uh what
nottheonion,removed,the first one was used seriously by an antifeminist thats literally why this discussion is happening
nottheonion,removed,and of course its bullshit a woman gets mad at her husband who may or may not have cheated grabs a gun and stupidly fires it into a mattress no one got hurt no other details are given just people in heated argument being stupid woopty fucking doo
nottheonion,removed,patriarchy is not men its a social system men are also victims in the patriarchy feminists talk about that as well
nottheonion,removed,the only challenge she faced mentally is that she got caught hand in the cookie jar and i bet she would have blamed the missing cookie on the other person
nottheonion,removed,what a toxic thread i love that almost none of the comments here give even the slightest consideration that there could be more to this story maybe she is wearing a shirt against domestic violence because she has experienced it at the hands of her husband over a number of years maybe this was the one instance where she decided to fight back but because her husband is a cop it was his word against hers and he has connections the men of reddit love to hate women
nottheonion,removed,proving it themselves by down voting you
nottheonion,removed,the point here is that that frailty of the human operator cant just be solved by putting a gun under lock its a serious issue if you know you might point a gun at your partner in the heat of the moment your thought process should not be ill hide the guns it should be ill fucking go to anger management or therapy to deal with the impulse to point a gun in an argument the presence of the gun is not the core of the issue
nottheonion,removed,islamic countries are the worst abusers of women and yet you still have feminists whining about some imaginary wage gap and things of the sort this is worse than the why complain when there are starving children in africa argument having an issue with western inequality does not in any way prevent somebody from having an issue with middleeastern inequality theres plenty of feminist campaigning regarding the middle east but youre not going to read about if from rtumblrinaction
nottheonion,removed,yeah bloody all women i cant believe all women have done this
nottheonion,removed,those arent womens rights activists or feminists theyre extremists and they are not furthering the movement in favour of their supposed cause in any way im also sure there were many people without an agenda and were just terrible people
nottheonion,removed,say that to my universitys feminists that are trying to pass a plovidy to help rape survivors the catch priority is given to everyone except men its literally written like this the reason men are the ones committing rape let me rephrase men are excluded from getting help because they share the same gender as some rapists i can link you the policy proposal by private message if you want
nottheonion,removed,they blame it on the patriarchy when they should be looking in the mirror blaming it on patriarchy is looking in the mirror patriarchy is a social system not an indictment against some nebulous group of evil men or something
nottheonion,removed,i presume youre referring to a completely different study heres the one from todays front page and the front page post in case you question this being the correct article only mention about filtering results omitting the phrases shaming and shame to remove tweets like slut shaming is wrong we focussed our analysis on the words slut and whore used on twitter for the month of may so far their quote their typo no clue where you get that figure from but about were dropped because they couldnt define the authors gender the volumes here are lower than the overall month volume because we are only looking at gendercategorized authors
nottheonion,removed,kinda clickbait thought it meant since she was wearing the shirt she got arrested not because she shot at her husbby
nottheonion,removed,i think youre a psychopath
nottheonion,removed,fucking mods he quoted a jezabel article that bragged about all of the times the editors assaulted their boyfriends
nottheonion,removed,when i lived in a shitty apartment in a shitty part of town i always kept my firearm on my nightstand i hear gunshots roughly per week there were several apartments in the complex that had their doors kicked in and it was only feet from my door to my bed but i was a single male living alone it was locked in a safe when i wasnt there it is really hard to put a theory to home defensegun ownership
nottheonion,removed,nope sorry that you had to find out this way
nottheonion,removed,ಠಠ
nottheonion,removed,how many of those are just guys that have those pics saved from stuff like rgonewild the data is screwed i say
nottheonion,removed,you do know that women outnumber men right
nottheonion,removed,i bet you you end up in jail for shooting someone you seem to have a policy for every possible situation a gun i think you are the kind of person who was behnd the trigger so many times but never had a target you seem dangerous to me
nottheonion,removed,well if my gf caught me flirting with another girl id probably accept a slap if you let her continue just because youre not supposed to hit a woman then youre that bitchs bitch shes assaulting you so shes a bitch you should be able to at the very least grab her fists and cross your legs gotta protect em
nottheonion,removed,why are you assuming that i cant assume men cant participate in feminist activism or discourse my point is more recruitment never once have i said men will not choose to be feminists but it seems like the word is more important than a system that would exemplify the ideal i mean look at this conversation right here youd rather remind me that of people are women in order to be the zinger guy silly me here i thought that of people were women i guess i should look more closely for beards and bald spots i didnt mean to straw man you but what does this little point you made say about me the point is what exactly ive never insinuated anything just saying more people will get involved bigger membership but if youre saying no to all that extra support thats cool too because everything feminists are doing these days is working they dont need my dumb ideas
nottheonion,removed,it is a convenient way to disempower women who disagree with you
nottheonion,removed,there is one board thats primarily women cgl
nottheonion,removed,the idea that homosexual couples are somehow better at fighting fair than straight couples just becausethey are is one of the most ignorant things ive ever seen on reddit having lived as the only male and only heterosexual person in a house of i must say lesbians are some of the cattiest dirtiest most physical and most frequent fighters i have ever had the displeasure of overhearing
nottheonion,removed,what
nottheonion,removed,its currently the top post in rfeminism but lets ignore that because feminism is evil
nottheonion,removed,so because he cheated he deserves to be physically harmed or in this case potentially shot and killed right
nottheonion,removed,privilege isnt an end all be all get out of jail free card in life privileges intersect all the time
nottheonion,removed,she was obviously just protecting herself from the manpredator
nottheonion,removed,maybe he domestic violences her which is why she had a gun handy during their argument
nottheonion,removed,extremely sorry to hear what happened to you the video is powerful but i feel like i have to remark that this video is of an actor making a monologue good on them for raising the issue though seems like theyre onto something when it gets the reaction it does
nottheonion,removed,playing devils advocate here maybe she was a victim of domestic violence and that day she had enough
nottheonion,removed,im more surprised that shes even going to get punished for it
nottheonion,removed,i totally agree with you but for the sake of clarity the argument actually applies there as well the argument is that white western civilizations keep the rest of the world down through the use of international organizations like the wto and imf which effectively limit how much control a nation actually has over its own destiny the use of corporations and trade deals further cements neocolonialism with the result that nations in africa and elsewhere are in many ways very dependent on the white power structure of global economics like i said i get what you are saying and agree but there is a lot more to the argument than just white people are racist as if its a bumper sticker the thing to keep in mind is that under that line of argument racism has a specific definition that incorporates that power imbalance that isnt the same as the normal daily use of the term and thats what causes confusion and makes the people making that argument seem unhinged when the argument is valid and should just use a different term funny enough reddit will rail against the idea of white racism yet if you take the word white out of the first paragraph above it reads like most any front page discussion that is even mildly political
nottheonion,removed,didnt say that she actually assaulted him just that she shot a mattress thats still horrible but i wouldnt think that the charge would be domestic violence maybe the article left some details out
nottheonion,removed,stupid white males dont you realize that women could never be domestically violent domestic violence comes from a position of power so a woman can beat rape abuse and kill her boyfriend and it still wouldnt be domestic violence you fucking white males
nottheonion,removed,i would bet my entire life savings shes a feminist
nottheonion,removed,why do you get to decide who the real feminists are who gets to decide that who arbitrates what constitutes a real feminist
nottheonion,removed,real scotts drink whiskey
nottheonion,removed,why was she waving a firearm around in the first place people dont just do that unless she was mentally ill which she cant be because shes being arrested and no mention of whether the husband has an abusive history not that he did but theres just no context to this story i reckon their relationship is a lot more complicated than this article makes out plus she thinks he cheated on her and owning a a firearm is legal in usa so this kind of thing is bound to happen bullshit clickbait
nottheonion,removed,like vegans
nottheonion,removed,those arent comparable situations hiding away guns when youre expecting to use drugs or alcohol is responsible you shouldnt have a gun available when drunk that just makes sense however if youre in a state where you dont trust and are considering defensive strategies against your so yeah thats not a healthy relationship at all
nottheonion,removed,i know this is a woman as the aggressor so the shirt doesnt work but i always wanted to move to australia and sell tshirts that say beat your dick not your shelia and by always i mean seconds ago when i thought of this
nottheonion,removed,well its not domestic violence if the fucker asked for it
nottheonion,removed,i dont know nor care what the differences are so im going to hold this thing against this group that doesnt even do this thing
nottheonion,removed,fucking mras and redpillers are everywhere
nottheonion,removed,he had discovered a sex story she was writing about another dude on her laptop so he picked it up and threw it and thats when she socked him he was uh totally asking for it yeah he was totally asking for it
nottheonion,removed,he should have just made her a sandwich like she asked
nottheonion,removed,he probably grew up around abused women and shitty male role models did he say it as if he was downplaying your abuse most of my male role models were extremely shitty to the women i hold dear so for a long time i was pretty much apathetic to mens issues in relationships not anymore but im reluctant to even bring it up sometimes because alot of the times it attracts antiwomen or sexist shit derailing real issues facing men biggest fear im going to scream rape if you dont do thisthat
nottheonion,removed,why is it their job to do something about it the same reason its a companys job to protect their trademark if they dont do something about people using their trademark then they have no right to turn around and complain when someone is using it in a negative manner that makes them look bad its their image its their job to protect it at all times
nottheonion,removed,thats my position as well i generally like his commentary and his show can have some worthwhile discussion so i would lean towards hoping that this is just him being ignorant
nottheonion,removed,youre only talking about one country chinese men outnumber white people period
nottheonion,removed,came here to say this
nottheonion,removed,shouldve disarmed her then beat her within an inch of her life but years in prison is okay
nottheonion,removed,you know there are laws that prevent exactly what you just said the institution literally forbids the existence of said racism sure some remnants have remained but if you lose out on a job or are paid different because you are black call the police if theyre racist call the sheriff keep going up the chain until someone listens
nottheonion,removed,huh it almost sounds like having a gun in the house makes it more likely that someone will be shot with it
nottheonion,removed,it was actually a range up to
nottheonion,removed,stop demestic violence troy mcclure
nottheonion,removed,its not domestic violence if a man is hurt
nottheonion,removed,its so ironic that just like with privilege they say we cant see it because it benefits us yet refuse to even consider it could exist the other way as well
nottheonion,removed,i mean still he was in danger
nottheonion,removed,not just any humanity the humanity
nottheonion,removed,classic liberal i am guessing
nottheonion,removed,so asian blackface still racist
nottheonion,removed,the irony or just the feminism is too intense
nottheonion,removed,the orcs didnt disappear they lost the will that had been driving them the captains bowed their heads and when they looked up again behold their enemies were flying and the power of mordor was scattering like dust in the wind as when death smites the swollen brooding thing that inhabits their crawling hill and holds them all in sway ants will wander witless and purposeless and then feebly die so the creatures of sauron orc or troll or beast spellenslaved ran hither and thither mindless and some slew themselves or cast themselves in pits or fled wailing back to hide in holes and dark lightless places far from hope
nottheonion,removed,what are the risks of having a gun near by afraid its going to jump up and bite you unless you pull the trigger a gun will never ever ever ever go off its like saying i want to keep all my knives locked because im afraid they are going to stab me
nottheonion,removed,is it possible that she had the gun and fored what was essentially a warning shot because she was being abused by her husband
nottheonion,removed,yep of non reciprocal abuse is femalemeaning where abuse is one way its mostly women abusing men
nottheonion,removed,where were you when hulkamania ran wild on gawker
nottheonion,removed,if memory serves co is about women
nottheonion,removed,seems a smidge ricist
nottheonion,removed,it was her own property to play target practice with good ole lepage should pardon her two of the same cloth
nottheonion,removed,duluth model is from feminists have been suppressing dv research since the because it went against their narrative erin pizzey who founded the first shelter for abused women in is an antifeminist because feminists were against her when she tried helping male victims too
nottheonion,removed,typical feminist
nottheonion,removed,is one of the socalled top representatives of feminism its a culture of supporting clear misandry and sexism
nottheonion,removed,youre a white person who hates himself and his race because the left told you to
nottheonion,removed,due to the abuse womens rights activists spewed towards him for being a victim proof
nottheonion,removed,feminism in itself is nothing wrong as an ideology however the fact that a crackhead like anita sarkeesian can gain so much traction within the community and garner so much support is frankly disgusting its indicative of a far worse issue
nottheonion,removed,its literally the top story on rfeminism with comments
nottheonion,removed,what does your race have to do with anything
nottheonion,removed,with how whacked our justice system is i wouldnt be surprised if this lady is a victim as opposed to a aggressor it just so happened that day was when she finally blew a gasket after years of frustration on being abused either physically or verbally
nottheonion,removed,i mean as far as abuse stats go yeah but women are more likely to murder victims of domestic violence so while we may abuse more we dont tend to kill
nottheonion,removed,cuz only white ppl can b racist u fukin idiot
nottheonion,removed,test
nottheonion,removed,those who consider themselves feminist are among according to said no im not sure and refused to answer as an aside many people will find it interesting that you consider feminism and equal rights interchangeable as the number of people who support either is not at all comparable
nottheonion,removed,test
nottheonion,removed,mile doesnt call himself an mra though and for a time was very pro circumcision he said in an interview that he only agrees with mra things because they have a factual basis
nottheonion,removed,i completely agree with her
nottheonion,removed,exists in the same fairy tale land as so i completely agree with her
nottheonion,removed,you cant internalize values that are
nottheonion,removed,i listen to it but i just dont hear it theres more productive things to be concerned about imo i understands the shit women go thru and it pisses me off as well i stopped sticking up for them after i saw the racist shit some of them would post i cant fuck with them
nottheonion,removed,its not domestic violence if a woman does it s
nottheonion,removed,its transparently obvious that exists in the same fairy tale land as heterophobia so i completely agree with her
nottheonion,removed,how do we know that she wasnt using the gun to protect herself from him being violent towards her maybe she took up the dv cause because she knows first hand what its like and then she was pushed too far
nottheonion,removed,look if youre a person of color and you go around saying i cant be racist and all you do is go around saying white jokes im gonna call you a racist exhibit a louis farrakhan and no i am not a white accomodationist either uh i dont believe any of what youve said because if you were talking to social sciences people in academia you would have probably picked up some of what was actually said instead of tilting at windmills black people can be racist the exact same way jews can be antisemites or gays can be homophobes or women can be misogynists id love to know whos actually argued otherwise and been taken seriously you can obviously internalize values of an oppressive system even if you happen to be until its jackboots
nottheonion,removed,one swallow does not a summer make domestic violence is overwhelmingly perpetrated by men
nottheonion,removed,she gets years in prison for shooting a bed and this fuck nut from canada kills people and only gets years wtf
nottheonion,removed,i find it hard to believe that lincoln was in favor of a bill to abolish slavery as an advantage to the civil war that the bill itself caused thats like the craziest of bull shit that is literally putting the cart before the horse
nottheonion,removed,hey look its a downvoted joke reversing the typical sexist wouldnt have been hit by the car if she was out of the kitchen position misandry s
nottheonion,removed,can i get a source i dont know enough to adequately dispute it but im pretty sure what youre saying makes no sense the north participated in a war sparked by the dispute against slavery to cripple the souths resources so they could win the war against slavery but only to cripple their resources and not for the actual reason to cripple their resources that doesnt make sense to me but let me know if im missing something
nottheonion,removed,you didnt cite a source
nottheonion,removed,you were the first person to use the word slavery slavery is almost entirely unrelated to this discussion racism was a white invention simple as that to praise us for being less racist than we have been before is simply absurd
nottheonion,removed,yeah i guess its just my unwillingness to have any accidents happen with a gun around me p the lack of small children probably makes it less risky and that variable did lead me to my conclusion though as someone else mentioned below yeah it isnt a one size fits all solution i assume the worst in those around me so i dont get caught unprepared i guess
nottheonion,removed,so if its racist to criticize all white people for the racists which to be clear i think it is then by your own logic its racist to thank them see
nottheonion,removed,i dont peruse the internet looking for feminist groups im just going off of what i see people whining about here
nottheonion,removed,in the study they claim to have controlled for nonaggressive uses of the terms httpwwwdemoscoukpressreleasestaggeringscaleofsocialmediamisogynymappedinnewdemosstudy i cant speak for how well this worked as its a proprietary system but they were certainly aware of this as a potential issue controlling for such things would be pretty standard practice in content analysis
nottheonion,removed,are you saying all racist whites should be executed i mean i hate bigotry as much as the next decent guy but thats too much
nottheonion,removed,hopefully jezebel will disappear with the rest of the gawker trash
nottheonion,removed,theres a story on the front page right now about how of all misogynistic tweets are from women feminists are dodging these comments like crazy im sorry what world are you from where this website is typically rampant with feminists
nottheonion,removed,i assume he called it a war to avoid being downvoted for describing it as a circlejerk and trying to say something simple and logical which judging by the little red cross next to his name it didnt work
nottheonion,removed,lets hold on a second we dont know the whole story perhaps she is a domestic violence victim and finally lashed out herself
nottheonion,removed,ive been through most of the comments on here and havent seen anything that even suggests spousal rape would you link them for me
nottheonion,removed,as europeans encountered people from different parts of the world they speculated about the physical social and cultural differences among various human groups the rise of the atlantic slave trade which gradually displaced an earlier trade in slaves from throughout the world created a further incentive to categorize human groups in order to justify the subordination of african slaves drawing on classical sources and upon their own internal interactions—for example the hostility between the english and irish powerfully influenced early european thinking about the differences between people—europeans began to sort themselves and others into groups based on physical appearance and to attribute to individuals belonging to these groups behaviors and capacities which were claimed to be deeply ingrained race as a social construct was made up to further white supremacy whether it was intentional or not also claiming that this had anything to do with genomics at the time is insane considering genomics was not studied until the cut the race realist bullshit as most who study genomics agree that race has little effect on gene sequences and is a shitty way to categorize people since there are so many variable other than how they look and your article basically says that our socially constructed ideas of race dont make sense biologically a quote from jonathan marks by the it had become clear that most human differences were cultural what was not cultural was principally polymorphic – that is to say found in diverse groups of people at different frequencies what was not cultural or polymorphic was principally clinal – that is to say gradually variable over geography and what was left – the component of human diversity that was not cultural polymorphic or clinal – was very small a consensus consequently developed among anthropologists and geneticists that race as the previous generation had known it – as largely discrete geographically distinct gene pools – did not exist

nottheonion,removed,yeah the jews removed the wings too early
nottheonion,removed,that experiment would actually be a good learning experience the conspiracy theorists are right that jet fuel cant melt steal beams but what they neglect is that at jet fuel temps the steal beams will lose most of their strength with proper gloves you can easily twist a steel rod that hot into a pretzel shape

nottheonion,removed,doesnt paleontology cover more than just dinosaurs no thats not what i said and i explained my meaning in case i wasnt clear enough i dont think its necessarily antiscience it actually appears to be indifferent about promoting or helping people understand science―seeking profit instead it is a news reporting service they are reporting news related to a number of science topics again not sure how one of those topics being dinosaurs is such a big deal to you they are informing people about happenings in paleontology related to dinosaurs at a surprisingly great depth the fact either of you felt the need to bitch about it is mindblowing to me nitpicking to the nth degree

nottheonion,removed,the force was too strong for him
nottheonion,removed,now youre talking nonsense its the responsibility of the employer to earn the investment back no it is not the responsibility of anyone pick one the only way you could conceivably resolve this is if you assume all employers are corporations this is also ignoring this nonsensical statement we are not economic agents we are people people are economic agents in that their wants and needs are what define a market value were allowed to have motivations that have nothing to do with money time is the most valuable limited resource we have and you can choose to spend it on leisure or honing your marketable skills if youre well into your career you can afford to spend more of your human capital on the former all this said you managed some impressive clintonlevel questiondodging and failed to perhaps i should rephrase given the following umontigue said people actually get suspicious if a product is too cheap to give what is offering this means there is a minimum price where the most people would consume a product while still making profit to which you replied unless a product is my labor and people is my employer then if its too expensive i get fired and then elaborated the reason to fire you is because they find someone who will do the job for less than you in your mind why cant i walk into a star restaurant and take the job of the head chef by telling the owner that id work for some amount less than his current salary lets say half

nottheonion,removed,nah bro you dont understand i bet youre some whitey mayo fucker from the suburbs go fuck your dog
nottheonion,removed,because hes clearly playing off the notion that blm activists arent peaceful protesters but rabble rousers who want to start shit and advocate cop killing i do blame people on social media with their hatred towards police he said while pointing out that last nights dallas protest was peaceful patrick said i do blame former black lives matter protests now if you cant cull from those comments that the previous protests hes referring to some of which took place right there in dallas where protesters became unruly disruptive blocking freeway traffic downtown streets interrupting presidential candidates rallies et all are the ones hes referring to in contrast with the organized and planned dallas peaceful rally then maybe it should be stated to the uninitiated what the clear and overtly obvious difference is demonstrations like the one planned and coordinated in advance with city leaders in dallas are in stark contrast to these previous ones patrick refers to this was a deliberate coming together of solidarity and conversation police officers and peaceful protesters were shaking hands posing for pictures together overall coexisting and sharing dialog these previous protests patrick references were mostly covert adhoc and opportunitistic guerrilastyle ambush rallies they were meant to disrupt society and be a look at me moment they deliberately meant to obstruct and be in your face the main differences between the two the guerrilastyle protests were angry disruptive and almost entirely perpetrated by african americans the ones that took place in dallas were planned in advance with city leaders and asked for inclusiveness so that all that wanted to be a part could do so it promoted coming together and sharing a common message of learning to understand how we can try to come together so if blm was involved in both whats the difference in patricks attribution to blm being partly responsible for this and this being racist simple people like patrick are too narrow minded to recognize the difference between a real organization created for the purpose of advocating for ones rights and asking for equality and opportunists who flaunt organizations basic ideals to accomplish their own agendas and the majority of these opportunists who hijack these initially planned nonviolent nondisruptive blm protests are simply angry black people looking for a release for their anger and frustration no different than events like after ferguson after rodney king the watts riots of in la where looting rioting gets ugly actions like those arent actions of people who want to advocate for peaceful change in short i had this same discussion with someone at work today who told me that blm advocates killing cops and overall disruption and mayhem so i went to their site and said show me on their site where that is in their mission statement educate me he replied similarly to patricks idealogy well what their site says and what they do is totally different to which i replied with oh you mean like how christians act differently than the bible says as christians mission statement that shut his bigoted racist ass up
nottheonion,removed,im saying theyre not as peaceful as you seem to think idk if you saw this but a member murdered a post woman for being white
nottheonion,removed,i dont know man thats a fucking senseless tweet to put out given the circumstances given his other comments given his general stance and perspective i am not sure i want to give him the benefit of the doubt he seems exactly like the type of person who would put something like that out after hearing about orlando complete piece of shit

nottheonion,removed,some say they do some say they dont i dont actually study it for a living so i dont know but these parents and other parents dont either the point was they were protesting the allergy ban even if airborne peanut allergies arent a thing what about some type of chocolate or whatever that has peanuts in it people saying they have an allergy might eventually get on a chefs nerves and they might ignore it like this chef ignored a personal choice
nottheonion,removed,npr is a cesspool what do you consider fair and balanced news is that a joke it is the most proestablishment leftist cesspool in the us look at what they did to sanders to support hilary look at what they are doing to trump they are the most biased filth in the us

nottheonion,removed,putting wifi in a washing machine makes a lot of sense for once you could replace all the buttons and dials and fancy displays by a wifi chip and a app cutting manufacturing costs and reducing parts that can break instead of two dials for cycle and temperature and few other options or a complex menu on a tiny screen that must be navigated with up and down buttons like its you can get a fancy user interface on your touch tablet which could range from a washing wizard for grandma to an api giving access to all sensor readings and the ability to write your own washing cycles and add new features such as delaying operation until your solar panels reach peak output or modify spin settings at night for noise reasons if something goes wrong you wont be greeted with puzzling blinkenlights or error codes but a proper error message and if the problem isnt user solvable one tap on the screen connects you and the machine to service who will inform you about your options like dispatching a repair guy who already got the required spare part if you want to go mad with this the machine could even monitor its own health and call service before it fails lastly you can control the appliance remotely say check from the kitchen what the washer in the basement is doing or get an alert when the cycle is finished of course things could backfire too you may have to buy a tablet just for this purpose you cant wash if the tablet breaks or youre computer illiterate odds are the app sucks donkey balls and youre not allowed to change anything however criminals law enforcement and the russian secret service all have complete control because the manufacturer doesnt give a fuck about security and remote service could mean the appliance will do jack shit without dialing home asking its real owner for permission and report in detail what youre doing with it

nottheonion,removed,with the way the job market is right now if youre trying to break into aviation as a career i would suggest getting an entry level job before going to college so you at least have a base before you spend all that money on a degree that may or may not help you exactly my sentiment i started work as a ramp rat then went to school for my ap license for months when i graduated the market was saturated with experienced laidoff mechanics so i went to wichita state to start on an aerospace engineering degree ran out of funds so went back to flight support full time picking up odd jobs as an ap on a contractual basis did a lot saw a lot of really cool and really sucky stuff but learned a ton flight support was one of the toughest yet funnest jobs ive ever had eventually got hired on full time as a mechanic at another hangar until i got laid off went back to flight support with only a week unpaid but still a noticeable pay cut and kept working as though i hadnt missed a beat kept an eye out the whole time updating and revising my resume about every week and now work for the air force as a depotlevel mechanic with regular hours one hell of a pension and full benefits oh and the pay is great too i do feel a little unaccomplished because i have friends working on their masters while i havent finished any higher education but then i remember that i already have a career lined up and there wont be the stress of trying to find a job in my field once i do get my degree for what its worth my dads an md with another masters in ancient languages my moms an rn with a phd in educational administration and my brothers finishing up his phd in international politics i however with only my experience and ap am doing quite comfortably with no student loans tech school loans are minuscule to begin with solid job security and perfect credit one of the most valuable lessons ive learned is that a college degree simply isnt important anymore unless you know for certain that your intended career path requires it ive thought about going back to school a few times but nah im fine

nottheonion,removed,as i understand it the water coming out of the treatment plant is now fine per the epa copper and lead testing limit and it is testing fine at multiple points along the mains it is testing fine at these points because of the last year they have flushed millions of gallons of treated water through the pipes so that the naturally occurring lining has rebuilt itself in those pipes the problems arise when the water leaves the mains and enters into businesses and homes they have not been running millions of gallons through those pipes so the natural lining has not built up sufficiently in many buildings the water sitting in those pipes then is exposed to lead and is unsafe to drink since running huge quantities of water through every sink and bathtubshower in every home is not really practical the best option appears to be to install lead filter systems on all taps the problem here is that for lots and lots of folks that process is not easy the judge in this case is a pretty conservative guy but like everyone else in the state has become fed up with the slow response of the state in addressing the problem of getting safe water to flint homes and businesses so instead of making residents continue to bring in bottled water for drinking cooking cleaning and bathing he ordered that the state ensure that all homes had proper filters properly installed or the state could deliver bottled water rather than making the residents go pick it up as a side issue the water in the mains seems to meet epa lead and copper safety requirements but from time to time has had other issues that needed to be treated

nottheonion,removed,after the inquest rafaels mum maria told the men i lost my son how many children have to die to be able to put some signage in place points there is usually an application process for getting signage approved while i am vague on the specifics of every jurisdiction in america im sure that human sacrifice is not a part of any of them what is the sign going to say people who cant swim in water drown in it it was a canal that everyone else was swimming in weirs are dangerous enough to be nicknamed drowning machines i could get behind her outrage if he had been caught in a weir that didnt have a sign but it was just a canal
nottheonion,removed,its not his fault that his race is genetically disadvantaged
nottheonion,removed,this is natural selection thats why were laughing
nottheonion,removed,someone died and you oughta show some compassion
nottheonion,removed,i hope its not true i kinda giggled when i read this post
nottheonion,removed,natural selection doesnt work like that
nottheonion,removed,is that really the best photo of the deceased they could have used for this story
nottheonion,removed,its good that we dont transplant brains from people
nottheonion,removed,natural selection at work
nottheonion,removed,thats some darwin award shit right there
nottheonion,removed,maria who followed the proceedings through an interpreter said she wasnt aware of this but called on warning signs to be put up near canals to warn other children det sgt ocallaghan said he was told the trust said it wouldnt be feasible for signs to be erected over such a vast area put up all the signs you want you cant fix stupid
nottheonion,removed,isnt it ironicdont you think
nottheonion,removed,people are so fucking entitled you really think a sign would have made a difference its not the governments job to tell you to not swim if you cant swim its not our fault if you dont have common sense
nottheonion,removed,his family is now calling on the canal and river trust to do more to warn young people of the dangers of jumping into water there are no warning signs on that area of the canal after the inquest rafaels mum maria told the men i lost my son how many children have to die to be able to put some signage in place no america stahp
nottheonion,removed,well hes blackits not a myth that most blacks cant swimdespite black olympic swimmers its a factin florida every time we hear that someone drowned in a canal or lake or river they are invariably black teenagers and this has been going on for decades
nottheonion,removed,yeah thats right its the canals fault now time for those ghetto lottery winnings
nottheonion,removed,why doesnt she just admit her kid is idiot i understand she is sad but its partially her fault for not educating her kid properly no kid in right mind would jump into a canal without knowing how to swim its basic instinct and common sense he lacked both and he died
nottheonion,removed,i lost my son how many children have to die to be able to put some signage in place facepalm
nottheonion,removed,of course he was black
nottheonion,removed,its basically natural selection at work here so eh
nottheonion,removed,im sorry but what a fucking idiot its akin to jumping off a skyscraper to overcome your fears of heights oo
nottheonion,removed,serious question how come so many black people cant swim
nottheonion,removed,idiot
nottheonion,removed,darwin in motion
nottheonion,removed,is someone going to bring back the darwin awards
nottheonion,removed,to be honest as sad as it is this kid was pretty dumb if you jump into a deep body of water without an inkling of how to swim you are putting yourself in mortal danger not only yourself what about the people who might try to save you and end up in danger themselves sad that he died but it was crazy irresponsible and even a teenager should have that level of common sense
nottheonion,removed,well this kid wins the darwin award its a tragic loss of life and i feel sorry for his family but honestly did it never occur to that kid to try a bloody swimming pool first
nottheonion,removed,this is just life balancing itself out
nottheonion,removed,maybe he should have learned to swim first
nottheonion,removed,i would just answer with now go away bitch
nottheonion,removed,putting in his darwin award submission a bit late this year
nottheonion,removed,natural selection at work
nottheonion,removed,well that really sinks edit stinks woops
nottheonion,removed,blaming it on the lack of signs im sure signs will warn of teenagers
nottheonion,removed,its crazy to me that his mom blames the canal authority for not having a warning sign like that would stop a teenager from doing something stupid
nottheonion,removed,rdarwinawards
nottheonion,removed,yea dont be dumb when you know you cant swim lol
nottheonion,removed,strong candidate for darwin award lol
nottheonion,removed,if you cant swim make sure theres a lifeguard there to pull your ass out so you dont drown like this stereotypical kid
nottheonion,removed,lol and hes black can this get any more streotypical
nottheonion,removed,why does the mother blame the canal what
nottheonion,removed,idiot kid who couldnt swim died trying
nottheonion,removed,black people
nottheonion,removed,of course hes black
nottheonion,removed,black people cant swim its not a secret
nottheonion,removed,kill your self and i hope your mom gets cancer because she obviously doesnt know how to raise kids
nottheonion,removed,all the people here laughing being happy and making jokes about a dead black kid really need to consider putting a fucking gun in their mouths
nottheonion,removed,i bale uspez for this childs death
nottheonion,removed,i was taught to swim at like swimming lessons i cant even fathom not understanding how to swim it comes as naturally to me as blinking
nottheonion,removed,just doggy paddle
nottheonion,removed,thank you for voluntarily helping increase the planets cumulative iq by killing yourself in one of the dumbest ways possible
nottheonion,removed,like this comment if you reddit
nottheonion,removed,oh i apologize in the name of the universe guys all drowning jokes are banned from here on out because ugloriousgardener had an accident once
nottheonion,removed,i think all of us talking here were not stupid enough to jump into a canal when we couldnt swim in fact im sure of it
nottheonion,removed,ill leave this here
nottheonion,removed,was he black e african american e african american british e light the fuck up ppl im joking
nottheonion,removed,black people cant swim breddy heleryous
nottheonion,removed,is it because hes black kek
nottheonion,removed,they dont have swimming lessons in the uk
nottheonion,removed,maybe his dad shouldve oh wait
nottheonion,removed,of course he is black
nottheonion,removed,black people are really this dumb huh
nottheonion,removed,i did dumb shit that could have hurt me i didnt do things that could easily kill me
nottheonion,removed,im not saying youre wrong about signs vs common sense im just confused what makes you think signs are entitlements what dont you understand or how a grieving motherdrowning son are entitled it seems like you just want to be outraged that i dared to point out something stupid that a grieving mother called for maybe thats the wrong interpretation but judging by the tone of your writing and how you seem to already understand what i meant by entitledsee first two quotes im having trouble coming to any other conclusion do you care to elaborate on what you dont understand what exactly do you not get
nottheonion,removed,mostly just black kids l drowning rates among blacks aged – years times higher than those among whites in the same age group this disparity was greatest at ages – years at these ages blacks drown in swimming pools at times the rate of whites
nottheonion,removed,being snarky to a joke is pretty autistic
nottheonion,removed,this is rather funny
nottheonion,removed,darwinism at its finest
nottheonion,removed,im sorry but isnt this a perfect example of natural selection
nottheonion,removed,exlifeguard and swim instructor this is the exact problem with the above advice its well meant but dangerous treading water is hard for beginners super sink like a stone hard it doesnt take long to learn but it isnt instantaneous most people will sink to the bottom very quickly on their first few tries making crappy arm movements and kicks that arent efficiently pushing enough water to keep them afloat there is a very dangerous myth that almost everyone believes humans instinctively know how to swim that instinct exists for almost all animals not true of most apes we drown babies weirdly seem to have some instinctive ability to floatswim but not adults or children we learn by doing if your first action when being thrown into deep water correctly moves enough water in the right way youll keep doing it feedback learning kicks in and you will probably survive if your first few actions are inefficient bad luck you sink and drown and stop learning you can stay with your head above the water just by pushing water down and propelling yourself up this is very dangerous advice because it is like describing how to ride a bicycle to someone you cant really do it if you dont know how to swim and you cant tread water you will likely die if you try to do this your very best bet is to get horizontal either by floating or by paddling vertical drowning very little surface area very little buoyancy get horizontal even if its underwater then try to get to the surface here are your two options imo if it isnt too deep bounce go to the bottom crouch push off strongly then streamline your body when you break surface breath out shout help breath in hold it stay calm wait to sink to the bottom again repeat if you are thrashing near the surface or are barely staying afloat bend backwards stretch out arms and legs and try to relax i know lifedeath situation panic see you are trying to put the back of your head on the surface of the water then push your belly button as high as it can go the best best advice though is get into shallow water and play around if you dont know how to swim learning to swim and move in water is not an instinct for us it is a learning curve and getting yourself even slightly along it might mean the difference between sinking and doggy paddling when in a dangerous situation
nottheonion,removed,lol black ppl
nottheonion,removed,back to the safespace you go
nottheonion,removed,black people cant swim
nottheonion,removed,til its just not black ppl in america who cant swim this is a worldwide phenomenon
nottheonion,removed,an idiot removed from the gene pool we are all better because of it
nottheonion,removed,but really to me it sounds as stupid as not knowing how to walk most humans live on land not water you cant compare walking to swimming because one is a necessary skill for survival while the other isnt im more surprised that people arent able to keep their head above water at all its super simple dont really need training not to drown right its one of those things that once you have it figured out you look back and say wow that was so easy why didnt i have it figured out earlier none of the skills you learn in the first years of your life walking using tools etc translates into staying afloat in water its actually not as intuitive as you think it is when you fall in water you first have to pronate your body to stabilize yourself then find a rhythm to pump up have you ever seen httpspotthedrowningchildcom yeah the whole process might sound dumb to you but hey think about the first time you went skating do you think not being able to stand on ice is as stupid as not knowing how to walk its the same with swimming
nottheonion,removed,it is still stupid
nottheonion,removed,a cvs spokesperson apologized and added that the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained fuck that fire that employee best case scenario people start going to that cvs just to fuck with the employees

nottheonion,removed,fuck it is spreading
nottheonion,removed,fear

nottheonion,removed,eleventh cyclist killed in new york city this year
nottheonion,removed,now people are just fucking with this woman leave her be get that man and his laptop a straight jacket and a rubber room and stfu about marriage licenses
nottheonion,removed,fucking pigs cops the cops arent on your side if youre a cyclist or anyone else their existence has nothing to do with public safety
nottheonion,removed,i hope that murder gets fucking life in prison
nottheonion,removed,you cant really solve problems by ramming them with your car
nottheonion,removed,heaven forbid a cyclist not take up the lane and ride on the farthest possible outside of the shoulder to avoid making a car play the i think i can fit dont act like cyclists dont bring much upon themselves and im not defending the guy in the article just countering your broad statement that paints cars the evil ones and cyclists do nothing wrong
nottheonion,removed,in denmark there is the sentiment that no matter how idiotic the cyclist behave the fault and penalty will land on the motorist this is mostly enforced by law once i was holding completely still in a right turn and suddenly a woman just flew up on the hood witnesses told the cops that i had no fault in it but i still got the bill from the bike and painkillers and that is ok im the hard object and im just glad she was ok in the end it seems unfair at first but had she killed herself i would probably get months or go free and my required by law insurance took care of the money involved i think what america needs is a mentality change towards cyclist what i want to convey is that all cyclist en denmark are assholes and somehow it all works out anyways mostly because there is never any question where the blame falls
nottheonion,removed,you know what dickhead two wrongs dont make a right i follow the law when i bike i dont disregard others safety go fuck yourself you entitled douchebag
nottheonion,removed,not even that just a journalist pushing agenda be it right or wrong
nottheonion,removed,the us is a stone throw away from electing trump or clinton dont be a wanker is asking too much from us
nottheonion,removed,only poor people watch pbs instead of going somewhere to watch them they still liked what they saw bless their soul
nottheonion,removed,well youre a sociopath
nottheonion,removed,not saying either are worse or better overall but the cyclist in minneapolis that ignore stop signstraffic lights far exceeds the amount of drivers that do
nottheonion,removed,you are a pathetic excuse for a human being
nottheonion,removed,this is weird i drive in a moderately large city every day with lots of cyclists and i have no bad experience with cyclists i cannot relate in my experience bad drivers are a much bigger problem and cyclists are basically a nonissue
nottheonion,removed,seek help also read vehicle and traffic act for nyc before talking straight out of your ass about something you clearly know nothing about
nottheonion,removed,the cop issue and the safety of cyclists issue both resonate with me i lost my license due to racial profiling and the privatized forprofit legal system this caused me to have to get from point a to b on bike periodically biking feels especially dangerous in my area because everyone here is mostly young and they are not accustomed to bikers they are some real selfish driving individuals thats why i dont play them games and yield even though im the pedestrian when i see on coming traffic i will just pick up my bike and walk it in the grass
nottheonion,removed,to me rational consideration would have to include some sort of actual motive
nottheonion,removed,times in the same day not everyone ones a car and theres no room to park anyways
nottheonion,removed,if i hadnt glanced behind me to the left just before i was about to turn i would have been run over did you expect cars to stop for you so you could make your turn
nottheonion,removed,lmao wait so whos privileged again
nottheonion,removed,not everyone can afford a car and they might not even be old enough to drive in the first place
nottheonion,removed,i would support the death penalty for him if he is caught why is this any less bad than any murder
nottheonion,removed,so the same goes for me in my car or on my motorcycle no then why do we selectively allow cyclists to disobey the law and then claim that the problem lies with motorists
nottheonion,removed,this piece of shit deserves a place in hell also fuck these pig cops
nottheonion,removed,people in this thread being dumb and getting pissed off theyre starting to enforce laws already in place meant to keep cyclists from getting hit by cars
nottheonion,removed,oh canada do you need to be great again too
nottheonion,removed,the peasantry shouldnt be allowed to use motor vehicles
nottheonion,removed,its simply not true that a cyclist cannot be at fault sounds like youre making shit up also you have an anger problem sorry you had to slow down for a few miles but its not the end of the world
nottheonion,removed,sounds like any time muslims blow up a public gathering better put a stop to these darn christians and their guns
nottheonion,removed,i dont come to a stop for the of the time i see approaching cars i stop for the of the time i dont
nottheonion,removed,am i the only person who thinks their names are racist as hell crowchief and white
nottheonion,removed,thanks attorney lots of attorneys in this discussion eh in your experience has it long been a thing that people pull some reasoning out of their ass and believe that it is law or is that a relatively new thing
nottheonion,removed,nothing against you i know i shouldnt but at this point i have a nearing irrational hate for cyclists they act as if they are a car and then pretend they are a pedestrian when it suits them they are running red lights on the wrong side of the road on sidewalks blowing past people when there are bike lanes they are wildly unpredictable and move very quickly
nottheonion,removed,they do or did just that in boston i lived on a busy street for cyclists and pedestrians police used to wait at a light to ticket anyone running red lights one cyclist actually ran a red light and almost hit a bunch of pedestrians while yelling im not stopping and then got pulled over by the cops it was great
nottheonion,removed,wtf canada
nottheonion,removed,while this is terrible because the guy died its fantastic they issued summons to cyclist running red lights july i watched a cyclist run a stop sign and smash head on into the side of a car turning left and then gave him cpr while he died in my lap now two daughters are fatherless a wife is widowed and im still going to a therapist about watching life leave a mans eyes along with the other or first responders all because he didnt want to add a few seconds to his practice time and thought cyclists dont have to obey the laws of the road
nottheonion,removed,id say someone who needs a two ton polluting weapon just to move one person from point a to point b is entitled
nottheonion,removed,news flash bback people are equally racist as well
nottheonion,removed,just to remind people of the facts woman attacked totally unprovoked attacker says i hate white people judge says he sees no evidence of racism or even racial bias attacker is taken away and then cries the white man was out to get her lol its like the onion editors actually did write this article
nottheonion,removed,youre a moron
nottheonion,removed,then what is racism
nottheonion,removed,the victims are targeted for who they are not because of anything they have done which is literally what happened here as the evidence shows attacker saying she hates the race of the victim and subsequently says that particular race is out to get her shes a racist who hates whites nuff said
nottheonion,removed,well her name was white she probably meant her whole family
nottheonion,removed,white people thinking they need the same protections minorities need since always and you wonder why people hate white people
nottheonion,removed,what a joke
nottheonion,removed,awesome now i can go to canada and shout i hate muslims and cut their throat and its not a hate crime
nottheonion,removed,ok however you would think that any reasonable person would immediately understand that hitting a cyclist with an automobile at any speed could cause a lethal injury this seems in line with a roadrage incident and the driver of the vehicle in my opinion could be accused of murder for having sense enough to know a bicycle vs a car is no match at all and the likelihood of the cycle rider to be seriously injured or killed is very probable
nottheonion,removed,so if i yell i hate black people right before i punch a black person in the face it wont be considered a hate crime
nottheonion,removed,if your not smart enough to move when a speeding object is running towards you you deserve the consquinces
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,that would fall under a crime of passion something done in the heat of the moment or also an act that the defendant didnt intend to cause a death but they had knowledge that a death would almost surely result it can be a tough distinction saying premeditation can happen in seconds is true but the analysis is always time plus circumstances if a prosecutor says that a homeowner who had already disarmed their intruder got angry about the intriders actions and therefore decided to kill them after a couple seconds thought thats one thing if the motive for murder is instead part of some labrynthian game of thrones style plot then you cant really say the defendant took a couple seconds to decide to kill someone that kind of premeditation obviously would require more time
nottheonion,removed,reverse the roles my man
nottheonion,removed,yeah i mean you should just buy a hummer already or a tank year better year buy a tank
nottheonion,removed,well i hated it the white woman said
nottheonion,removed,what in the world is happening to the comments oo
nottheonion,removed,its only bigotry and racism if white people do it
nottheonion,removed,whoa is this rnews why did a bunch of comments get deleted
nottheonion,removed,what is the point of allowing discussion if a salty mod is just going to keep deleting everything
nottheonion,removed,that is absolutely not true i know of a case where a white man stabbed a black man in self defense as he and his girlfriend were being followed and harassed by multiple black males at some point during the instance the white man had used the n word because of this the court ruled it a hate crime he had no prior record or pattern of racial bias and served jail time for defending himself and his significant other so i have to disagree with you its hard to make it stick when the crime is against a white person
nottheonion,removed,youll never get a perfect comparison of nyc with anywhere in the world im just saying that other cities that have a substantial cycling population are in general much safer and the cyclists are typically far better behaved i live in melbourne currently and if i tried the shit that i see nyc cyclists pulling id probably be fined or arrested pretty quickly its like people comparing gun laws of other countries to the us i think thats an entirely different issue altogether
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,itt
nottheonion,removed,man you guys have some weird conversations in here just people saying back and forth to reach other or is this like rcatsstandingup where every comment is supposed to just be cat but with instead
nottheonion,removed,id like to see what people think about this but the comments are all gone
nottheonion,removed,around blacks never relax lul
nottheonion,removed,you cant be racist against white people duh
nottheonion,removed,considering a persian engineering student from a wealthy family from irvinesafest city in the us was recently killed by a white supremacist gang member who had recently gotten out of prison for another murder this doesnt affect me at all i really do not care
nottheonion,removed,im really interested in this story if its your acquaintance maybe you can find some way to provide veracity for the account without revealing his info this is the kind of case that can really support an argument of reverseracism and i think its worth taking into account
nottheonion,removed,calgary usa
nottheonion,removed,is it
nottheonion,removed,fri calgary is canada the fbi dont mean shit
nottheonion,removed,so racism towards white people is okay
nottheonion,removed,i agreed with removed
nottheonion,removed,but van harten agreed with defence counsel adriano iovinelli that there was insufficient evidence to establish crowchief attacked white because of the colour of her skin ahhh i see her name was white guys so she doesnt hate white people she hates white people
nottheonion,removed,wow are you wrong
nottheonion,removed,hawaii usa i have lived here since i was a small child i am now they hide race crimes here because of tourism there is a real hate for caucasians and japanese visitors they are constantly targeted for everything from simply beating people up to killing and raping people here is one of the most disturbing cases but it is not uncommon at all this was the top by httpnpredditcomubloodfart another time this link was
nottheonion,removed,almost everything is deleted this might also be but here is a short reason on why i think the comments were deleted and why they in my opinion should not be lots of hate from both sides id assume i feel like it should have stayed open for conversation though yes people are gonna say bad things but it should be decided by the people it shouldnt have been censored lets take the no racism rule if someone where to say something horrible like damn n then just let them get down voted to oblivion like they would and should be the only one i can really see working is the witch hunting rule because which hunting ruins peoples fucking lives
nottheonion,removed,reddit censorship is shameful and pathetic
nottheonion,removed,if a person of color attacks a white person for doing something that pisses them off and that thing is something that a lot of white people tend to do one might yell i hate white people but the reason for attacking them wouldnt be that theyre white just that they did something a lot of white people do what is something a lot of white people do that pisses you off that involves cigarettes
nottheonion,removed,there sure are a lot of people not conforming with the narrative in this thread
nottheonion,removed,so if a white male punches a random black person after saying i hate black people its not a hate crime right
nottheonion,removed,am i popular now

nottheonion,removed,lack of accountability is the theme buddy try to keep up
nottheonion,removed,aside from boa which is paying for their own idiocy and greed just want to point out boa was not doing anything wrong during they went out and bought a company called countrywide who on paper should amazing results they incorporated this company and slowly uncovered on their own the incredible fraud that was going on they immediately stopped the fraud and began rolling back the fraud like calling people up modifying their loans and getting the shit off their books well mama doj didnt like that and said you will be responsible for the companies actions from before they were acquired this set a precedent that if anyone buys another company the buyer is responsible for anything that happened in the company they purchased in the past that is if i am a criminal i can sell my criminal enterprise and whoever buys it is now a criminal and subject to fines even if that person wasnt a criminal before and had no clue of the criminal actions big banks are bad but bank of america is not they are too big to fail i agree which caused countrywide to be purchased in the first place they didnt do good enough due diligence but that doesnt make them the evil corporation everyone makes them out to be i am really personal on this issue because i worked for most of the big banks including boa and you can tell in the culture that everyone there really tries because they have good intentions not because they have an evil motive

nottheonion,removed,i just wonder if any of you racial justice warriors has ever lived outside of the lily white suburbs race relations now are worse than at any time since the lat
nottheonion,removed,i have yet to meet someone who doesnt think a minority is a person
nottheonion,removed,well obviously shes wrong as possible but racism has gotten far worse since hes become president undeniable truth
nottheonion,removed,what a delusional cunt
nottheonion,removed,well lets have a real argument since you think everything is childish what would you wish to speak of
nottheonion,removed,addressing discrimination is exactly how you treat people like equals not when the discrimination youre addressing doesnt exist in any real or meaningful way in society yet leads to legislation that may impinge upon the rights of private citizens for example the cake baking thing i mean the case was literally broken by journalists who called bakeries all over the country until they found one that wouldnt bake a cake for a gay wedding then they cried on about oppression and bigotry being a huge problem in and demanded legislation to fix the issue as far as gay marriage is concerned youre welcome to your belief that it should be legal but those who oppose it do not do so out of bigotry and labeling them such only adds to the divisiveness the reality is that the majority of the people who dont want gay marriage legalized do believe in equal rights for gays and lesbians and whoever else but they also recognize that marriage is fundamentally part of the backbone of western society its the glue that has kept it together in the context of a media and political establishment that has waged a direct and certifiable war on the family unit and family values in western culture people see it as an issue under a larger umbrella of devaluing something that they hold sacred and vital to our existence now you can think that argument is absurd as much as you want but please dont cry bigotry or discrimination on the part of people who simply hold a different opinion than you furthermore democrats have been weak on immigration and weak on the refugee crisis not being racist isnt the same as wanting to give up your economic cultural and yes even racial heritage and future to foreigners and outsiders whom we are being told unfairly that we owe something to we owe nobody anything thats simply not how the world works its these policies specifically since you asked and others that have led to the divisiveness and resentment brewing on all sides of the political racial and ideological spectrums today in the world and i havent even discussed language policing or racism witch hunts which are probably the most frustrating and frightening of all for the average citizen
nottheonion,removed,from the person who ends their argument with im not going to argue with you its nice to know i can troll trolls when i need to though enjoy being partisan and right all the time
nottheonion,removed,thanks obama
nottheonion,removed,never forget unzip
nottheonion,removed,nice parents wheres a sjw when you need one
nottheonion,removed,i already did and theres nothing contradictory in that statement maybe you dont know what hyperbole is i dunno beyond that i see no reason why you would find that contradictory the world was more or less racially unconscious before obama took office people were just people people werent defined by their race religion sexuality or gender if you want to hearken back to times further in the past which i clearly was not making any mention of thats fine but its a strawman its a deliberate mischaracterization of my statements made for the express purpose of making them easier to refute whats essentially happened is that the democrats have sent us back to the attitudes and policies of the and before where people are defined by in a legal sense and thus separated by their racial makeup historically the democratic party has always been the party of division when you look at their record with slavery jim crowe and every other racially based piece of legislation thats ever come from out country somehow republicans saying lets just stop looking at race has always been considered the racist response though and years of democratic policy has done nothing but hurt african americans and race relations specifically
nottheonion,removed,lolthats a laughable statement when the la times wrote an exposé in
nottheonion,removed,can anyone provide a link of trump being racist im trying to get into politics and ive yet to see any proof of it

nottheonion,removed,get fucked
nottheonion,removed,lol did you even rad the shit you posted from your link as weve indicated the law walker signed does not mandate a transvaginal ultrasound though the headline used in the ad says walker endorsed mandating that procedure
nottheonion,removed,you mean this the law doesnt mandate transvaginal ultrasounds rather it says the woman seeking an abortion can choose either a transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound but medical professionals say that the new requirement as a practical matter means some women have to get a transvaginal ultrasound for a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information our rating is half true so half true at best that being said while i do not agree with the law is it rape for the tsa to do a cavity search on a male at the airport
nottheonion,removed,my god what is the deal with labels these days youre an idiot not everything fits into neat little categories
nottheonion,removed,was it rape or regret drunk sex or i was scared and didnt say anything or any of the other types of rape that arent really rape
nottheonion,removed,and a disproportionately large portion of those stranger rapes are committed by black men around blacks never relax
nottheonion,removed,it doesnt surprise me that he said that a lot of people and ive noticed this particularly men believe that the only true kind of rape is the stereotypical hollywood rape woman walking alone in dark alley gets rape by stranger blame and insensitivity gets served to the victims of rape by family friends lovers authority figures and anyone else they knew more often than not
nottheonion,removed,police isnt a race or an economic bracket its a job i never claimed it was a race or economic bracket this is reflected in the disparity between investigationarrestconviction rates for crimes that occur at the same rate regardless of race such as drug usedistribution do you have a source that shows drug use and distribution happen at the same rate for whites in nyc as blacks in nyc so to recap cops are racist this just isnt a claim that is based in any kind of reality and youre real pissy now that ive called it out no i do think you need to cite some sources for your bold claims

nottheonion,removed,dont you know that where they come from gang rape is a natural anti depressant you wouldnt want to be intolerant of their culture now would you
nottheonion,removed,people who dont share the same culture same language same religion do not share the same amount of sympathize sense of duty and responsibility for the others
nottheonion,removed,the number is not the issue its the motive and the very real concern that their motive is reflective of their culture where this kind of act is acceptable
nottheonion,removed,um dude homosexuality is a punishable offense in their world if the immigrants wanna rape to let off steam let them go buckwild we have no right to impose our values on them

nottheonion,removed,unpopular opinion time theres nothing wrong with pedophilia in and of itself gasp i think theres a nationwide refusal to think critically about what pedophilia is its a sexual preference i find it personally disgusting in the same way that i find latex fetishes gross i cant stand latex what gets another person off isnt anybodys business the problem with pedophilia is that fulfillment of the desire often involves something incredibly morally wrong and highly illegal taking advantage of kids sexually the people who make the porn are guilty of it the people who molest kids are guilty of it the people who watch the porn to suppress those desires rather than go out and molest kids are not guilty of it thats why its illegal to cut somebodys arm off and morally wrong to take advantage of the disabled by filming them in explicit situations against their will but its perfectly legal to be a consenting adult amputee pornstar and theres nothing wrong with a person having a fetish for amputees in and of itself i guess what im trying to say is that unless he made porn himself or actually molested a kid did he really do anything you wouldnt do if you were him oooooo i can feel the downvotes and kneejerk rage responses coming

nottheonion,removed,its weird the time where information is more freely accessibleverifiable coinciding with news organizations apparent and collective realization that wellcrafted news doesnt matter as much for attention as attention itself youd think itd be counterintuitive but the democratization of news or just the lowering of barriers blogstwitter are becoming trusted and anyone can write for a blog or twitter has meant that farming ad revenue has become a market game and so like with everything else capitalistic diversity has found a more optimal solution that delivers worse returns in the long term until this era id have no idea how tragedy of the commons could ever be applied to intellectual honesty but if you look at intellectual capital as being the resource being depleted it fits the model perfectly

nottheonion,removed,you know what this sounds like to me a textbook example of two lovers playing roles until one girl has a tyrannical homophobic father who threatens to scratch her from his will and testament or threatens to give her a clout in the ear said victim then makes up a total bulls story and hires a really good lawyer while another girl gets convicted the exact same thing happened everywhere years ago except the lovers would be a rich white lady and a poor white male or a black male from the streets then when father dear found out his daughter had an affair with someone of another social class shed declare rape to avoid having to face the consequences of an angry patriarch this whole case has been fishy ever since it started they should interrogate the victim again separate from her family to see if she wasnt lying because of shame or presure the judge should be under investigation as well for buying this story the judge may have used the case as a vehicle to commit a hatecrime in example being biased against gays and transgenders

nottheonion,removed,considering less things crimes would lower the crime rate like you suggest if we no longer considered anything a crime then there would be no crime yes technically true but just absurdly besides the point i was making when people talk about wanting less crime they dont mean they want to lower the number of things that are crimes and to pretend you dont know that is either idiotic or a troll starting to think youre just a troll justice isnt mercy like some people want but its not vengeance like some people think if your fanatical search for what you consider justice hurts society and creates more violence and crime than why would anyone with any common sense pretend like thats a good thing justice is good but only if tempered to ensure fewer situations where there are victims needing justice in the future

nottheonion,removed,if bikers could pedal themselves along at the speed limit lets say then i dont think anyone would care about them being in the road the whole reason we get pissed at bikers in the road is because they cannot even go the speed limit now most states have laws that say bikers can be in the road so long as they dont obstruct traffic but i think this type of law is selfcontradicting if you are a a cyclist and are riding on a mph road and you cannot at least go mph then you are in fact obstructing traffic a car can go mph but is being obstructed by you the cyclist who can go a max of mph which makes you a top contender in tour de france average bikers might go so cyclists are technically an obstruction on any road that allows more than oh wait silly me like you said bikers have a right to be here why should we build bike lanes then the whole point is to get bikers out of the way so that cars can actually use the road for its intended purpose but if bikers have a right to use the road then i guess we dont need to worry about bike lanes anymore and the benefits they provide to both bikers and drivers no no we should just encouraged soft squishy bikers to get out into a road with metal beasts driven by impatient assholes that dont enjoy being slowed down roads were built to accommodate cars when slow bikers use the road it creates a dangerous hazard as people might hit the biker might get hit by the distracted person behind them who didnt notice them slow down for the biker or expect that they would slow down might try to pass and hit someone car pedestrian or cyclist on the other side the laws regarding bikers in the road are contradictory and should be scrapped if we want biking to be an acceptable mode of transportation then we need to create better bikeable paths so that bikers do not obstruct traffic although i do agree with you that this was a total dick move and not the drivers responsibility to police the road

nottheonion,removed,repost from yesteday
nottheonion,removed,theres a limited amount of art that can he chosen for various things this statement is literally meaningless having ideology and art as criteria criteria for what refusing to consider ideology is an ideology on its own there comes a point where trolling becomes indistinguishable from actual retardation and youve passed it

nottheonion,removed,if you can join the army and train to kill at and drive a vehicle that requires responsibility at all times at i think a lad should be able to determine what he wants sexually at by typical standard he will have likely known for the past years isnt the age of consent too not a big deal unless he was coerced or physically forced this is just british tabloid culture loving a good lynching i dare say there was a teacher or two i would have tried if i had the charm and the confidence and to be honest those teachers like most would have likely been more careful about protection than year old girls lets shut up and let her bang who she wants as long as its consensual and above the age of consent

nottheonion,removed,youre just being a twat now you just seem to not be able to comprehend anything i say so you respond to my points by attacking my grammar i mean you can easily understand what i write if you cant then maybe thats your problem but yeah ignore the argument and focus on grammar and if youre not attacking my grammar you are responding to what i say with sigh instead of responding to the point i brought up that i actually said the opposite to what you have accused me off youre making yourself look like an absolute idiot are you just arguing for the sake of arguing and then you keep talking about how you are quoting everything so what who the fuck gives a shit if youre quoting youre clearly braindead then because you cant understand the things you quote some questions you asked how is it possible that i ignored your point while going through line by line lol quote me where i ignore your argument please quote me where i lie shall i answer i will try to make it simple for you you literally said they are providing legal assistance to an accused rapist which in your view is selfish this is laughable my comment before literally said it is necessary that we have lawyers who defend both the innocent and guilty nowhere have i said that providing assistance to an accused rapist is selfish inf act i will go as far to say that providing legal assistance to a guilty rapist is completely fair and necessary these quotes and the lack of me saying providing assistance to rapists is selfish is evidence that you ignored my point you ignored my argument and you are lying pretending that i am saying things that i am not and this is just one time this is one of a few examples the stuff you are saying about innocent people being punished and racist lawyers judging clients has nothing to do with what i said if you could explain how they are related to what i said it would be nice because as of now you are just talking complete nonsense to make it look like you have an argument your system results in more innocent people being convicted how please tell me how and what system since when did i come up with a system i simply said that lawyers who push for their clients to be get no punishment or a lesser punishment despite the fact that they know that they are guilty of terrible things are disgusting what system am i proposing and how do innocent people get harmed by this do you know how innocent people get harmed when murderers and rapists and child abusers escape a prison sentence when they should get one i am not proposing a system all i am doing is passing judgement and finding something unnecessary if you respond saying you disagree with my judgements then thats you but youre making all of these weird arguments and missing the points i am making how does a lawyer know if his client is guilty you would know if you could read go back an read or use some common sense even if the client is guilty does he not deserve the best defense to get a reasonable punishment again go back and read it isnt hard but as this is the whole point of my comments then i will respond for the time yes i literally said multiple times that yes both innocent and guilty people deserves lawyers in fact here are some fucking quotes it is necessary that we have lawyers who defend both the innocent and guilty try to make sure that those guilty see an appropriate punishment youre saying rapists and murderer deserve a defence i never said otherwise also you didnt answer my question with a yes or no like i asked not surprised though maybe you should just take a little while to relax and come back to this and see what you said or literally speak to anyone about it i mean you did say that letting a rapist murderer child abuser walk free is no more disgusting than an actor playing a villain i mean come onif youre going to reply with the same sort of comments youve been sending then just dont bother
nottheonion,removed,my brotherinlaw has a peanut allergy but hes responsible about it he carries an epipen and informs restaurant staff politely in advance also afaik he doesnt eat at places which serve a lot of peanutbased dishes im horrified that your mother would have treated you like this someone apparently took offense at my original comment but having worked at a casual dining restaurant for years a small group of people is serving hundreds of meals over the course of a couple of hours the pace is breakneck and the logistics are mindboggling they have a welloiled routine that is hard to break but people come in on a regular basis oh i forgot to mention i have an allergy to this item said item is in the special of the day its residue is everywhere in the kitchen everyone has touched it every station has cooked it now the server is standing there handing this person their meal and the other people they are with their meals this person ordered the special with this item in it despite its being part of the name of the dish and the server is expected to wave a magic wand and fix everything almost guaranteed she wont get a tip because this person had to wait or couldnt get what they wanted because theyre deathly allergic to the main ingredient so fuck everybody its all their fault im allergic to everything can you substitute for no im not being snide substitution isnt arbitrary just because ingredient and ingredient taste the same on their own doesnt mean theyll both taste the same when combined with ingredient and meanwhile ingredients have other properties they serve as binders or they add to a meals color or they do one of a dozen other things you might not be able to cook an otherwise potential substitute in the way in which a particular dish must be cooked a recipe is a formula a cook cant necessarily change it arbitrarily any more than a pharmacist can randomly recombine drugs in a pill to see what happens if the meal doesnt look or taste as advertised this person will be the first to complain every time why i dont know honestly but given the frequency of correlation im going to guess that it takes a person possessed of a certain selfentitled whats personal responsibility mentality to eat out at a place which serves food that can kill them maybe its more complicated than that part of a coping mechanism associated with the horror of knowing that something of us munch on as a snack is a lethal poison to the allergy sufferer whatever the case a person with a severe allergy needs to be responsible for what they put in themselves which includes either not eating at restaurants which focus on their allergen as a staple or being polite and informative while being prepared for the worst case scenario or having some kind of legal provision in place so that innocent people dont suffer for someone elses lack of responsibility the restaurant owner in this case got years for this mans death that is wholly utterly ludicrous

fixated on the ongoing stanley cup finals between the san jose sharks and pittsburgh penguins but at another competition a bit farther south the members of team brazil—a group of misfits and weekend warriors mostly plucked from the countrys inline rollerskating leagues—are focused on some of the simpler aspects of ice hockey like for instance skating they all really struggle said jens hinderlie brazils american coach turning left turning right and stopping is obviously the biggest thing the thirdannual panamerican hockey tournament which kicked off monday in mexico city allowed the brazilians to display their hockey stylings in games against teams from argentina colombia and mexico it also allowed many of them for the first time to play on a regulation ice rink theyre like kids in a candy store mr hinderlie reported theyre like oh my god ice ice ice brazils hockey team was formed in it is part of the brazilian confederation of ice sports which also supports national curling and bobsledding among various pursuits but other than the affiliation itself any official privileges are slim the group doesnt have any sponsors let alone a home rink in fact there arent any

have to share it with children and arent allowed to shoot pucks the icedeprived players as a result have been falling in mexico city—a lot luiz paulo serrano de araújo a engineering student from rio had never skated at an official rink he had to borrow skates from a friend braking and changing direction ive had a little trouble mr araújo said the body doesnt respond to what you want it to do pedro prado the oldest player on the team and a theater actor in rio also claims to be one of the best ice skaters in brazil he has been teaching some of the new players techniques for stopping on ice theres a trick i use when im teaching kids breathe exhale then brake mr prado said what the players lack in skating ability they make up for in enthusiasm mr hinderlie said ive been around hockey my whole life and the passion these guys have for the game is second to none bruno gomes plays left wing and is another of the teams veterans in the six years since he first tried ice hockey he has skated on ice a total of six times it was wonderful said marcelo rodrigues a realestate consultant from rio after taking the ice on mexico citys regulation rink theres nothing like it mr hinderlie played a bit of hockey when he was younger—going as far as the appleton wisbased fox cities ice dogs of the great lakes hockey league he also coached junior teams in juneau alaska but he didnt plan on continuing with hockey after meeting his brazilian wife gabriela on eharmony and moving to her home country once they arrived though and knowing her husband loved hockey gabriela reached out to the brazilian confederation to see if they had any job openings as it happened they needed a coach for the justformed hockey team this will be his second year as coach he concedes that the tournament is as much about attracting a potential sponsor and raising the funds to build a rink as actually winning games he along with team member daniel baptista a investment banker who spent a bit of time in canada and learned to skate there is confident the game could catch on if they had a rink in brazil its freaking hot from november to march april mr baptista said if you have a big rink where its cold you can play in the morning then go to the beach later in the afternoon thats the dream lifestyle for every hockey player in the world even though mexico city has several official hockey rinks the

nottheonion,removed,can i ask why its been used that way for a long time and its grammatically correct but it seems to be getting a lot of hate lately
nottheonion,removed,i dont see the harm in it myself no one has to write anything down if they dont want and for those few students who want something different it gives them that option but its blown out of proportion by anyone who gets upset over anything that isnt he or she and so they immediately jump all the way to saying its the same thing as identifying as an attack helicopter or something that seems more silly than the policy but thats just me im in a school where occasionally professors will let us do this and no one gets confused or upset and no one makes a big deal out of it its just another thing
nottheonion,removed,maybe just give them a box to fill their own in relax
nottheonion,removed,im sorry friend it must be really hard for you right now
nottheonion,removed,youd say what do they want not does there has been some argument about it but its been used as a singular pronoun httpblogdictionarycomgenderneutralsingularthey ive noticed people use it that way anyway like if im talking about someone i talked to online and dont know who they are ill just say they said something
nottheonion,removed,why do people give a fuck what other people want to be called i just dont understand why this is such a big problem for you guys if someone prefers to be called theythem why is it so hard to be respectful of their wishes
nottheonion,removed,between you and me i dont think downvoting a post is that shitty when compared to the things that happen here
nottheonion,removed,i just cant understand why people like him his soul is dog shit
nottheonion,removed,its still treated as grammatically plural so the plural verb still applies httpswwwcopyeditingcomsubjectverbagreementandthesingularthey
nottheonion,removed,ok why are you fucks such fucks admittedly ive sighed in mild annoyance at certain things like pronouns i find weird but whatever the fuck happened to being a decent human being i keep that shit to myself whats happening here is some entitled rich little shit thats had everything go his way his entire life is ripping on people that have been generally mockedoppressed whatever and all of you fucks like as far down as i go all of you are on his nuts how does that make even the slightest amount of sense do none of you know what the word empathy is even if you dont agree with it this is shit that does affect some people emotionally and youre cheering on a dude thats bullying them fuck what you think of the people being bullied you are supporting a bully think about that for a sec let it roll around and marinate in your heads fuck ive never been this disgusted by this place before just unreal
nottheonion,removed,honestly if you felt like you were an attack helicopter i would respect your pronouns if youre just doing it for attention or to mock people id say that brrrrts the kind of asshole that mocks people who dont feel comfortable in their own bodies thats not deserving of respect
nottheonion,removed,because they dont make much sense to anyone who hasnt been indoctrinated in identity politics i mean how am i supposed to know what your preferred pronouns are before you inform me and then even when you tell me how am i supposed to remember what your pronouns are when theyre not common or not even in a dictionary worse say you decide to change your identity without telling anyone and you get offended when people misgender you with the old pronouns you spent months telling them to use its absurd nonsense from any perspective outside identity politics hell i dont even know how to pronounce ze or xe or hir or any of those others ive never heard them spoken authoritatively ive only read about them and even then only in the context of proposed genderneutral pronouns from a book published less than a decade ago its too new too unstable too confusing and too much cognitive load i have more important things to think about than your preferences about my language
nottheonion,removed,considering that exists specifically for the purpose of mocking people for things that some have arbitrarily decided is ridiculous ill go with yes
nottheonion,removed,the problem is youre putting them on the same level like you honestly think theres no difference at all between something that has been gaining a little traction arguably not much sure entirely for this purpose and an inanimate object i do think it can get a little confusing when people are trying to figure stuff out but i dont think its nearly as ridiculous as some are relentlessly trying to make it
nottheonion,removed,i have trans friends and ive seen how hurt they get wow did you seriously just refer to trans people as they thats so transphobic of you
nottheonion,removed,no one has to respect me but i am sure as hell not playing make believe with some confused homo
nottheonion,removed,why stop there why not just lock them into some sort of enclosed facility maybe make them work a little
nottheonion,removed,yes and youre talking to one right now i know what my gender is and most people respect it because its a very simple request if youve never questioned yourself and youve always been confident in who you are great not everyone has the same experience and so they sometimes ask for something else thats all it is youre trying so so hard to make that sound as ridiculous as possible but its really not
nottheonion,removed,i have trans friends and ive seen how hurt they get by getting called the wrong pronoun and they both use standard binary pronouns question for you is this upon initially meeting your friends or an insistence to not use the pronoun theyve requested the former to me seems like an honest mistake while the latter would be being an asshole
nottheonion,removed,no ones saying you can change your gender on a whim but what part of that makes my statement moot im just talking about a word equivalent to singular they that doesnt have the ambiguity of being a homonym of the plural the rest of em come from tumblr trolls
nottheonion,removed,i dont think it has to be that big of an issue for me its just that if someone says hey id rather be called this i do that most people who do that arent doing it to be super special or difficult look at this thread the reaction theyd get wouldnt be worth it for legal things sure i think thats worth trying to figure out but imo one thing at a time i dont know where that last part comes from though whos saying logic and rationality or bad or that everyone owes them something
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,well rthedonald is still around despite incessant brigading so i guess it goes both ways
nottheonion,removed,people find a way to express themselves in a way that makes them feel more comfortable via new pronouns then asshats on the internet have to go and mock the whole thing until nobody can take it seriously thing ruined for people trying to express themselves this happens a lot on reddit on the internet and in the world in general and it makes me sad like people have nothing to lose and yet for some reason its just infuckingtolerable to be open to new ideas
nottheonion,removed,sure but the problem is anyone moves the goalposts wherever they want one person you might think is fine but someone else might think theyre completely ridiculous and stupid and shouldnt be respected id rather humor the few people who act like that just to be different which theyll probably grow out of anyway if it means not mocking the rest for stuff they really care about
nottheonion,removed,thats weird because my experiences are totally different but because you said it it must be true for everyone
nottheonion,removed,i was wondering when that would come up for what its worth the only reason it bothers me at all is because of the people who take it beyond joking and use it to basically be a dick to anyone they dont agree with like if i say im trans some people might be totally cool with it while others go oh yeah so you just choose whatever you want huh some people joke but understand anyway but for some people thats their entire perception of someone like me
nottheonion,removed,yeah i will say that right now i think a lot of people are in a kind of figuring out phase gender is something people actually talk about now so people are seeing what works for them which is great and all but it leads to a sudden jump in labels and meanings and stuff i think and hope eventually that will start to settle though
nottheonion,removed,sympathy for others i guess im a fickle person
nottheonion,removed,the other admins use other accounts you have to actually back that up with information
nottheonion,removed,i guess i can see that way of thinking i dont think it would end up that way in most cases and i would rather do something useful for a majority even if it means having to humor a few people who take it over the top here and there like in my case ive never used anything like this because frankly i dont want to be out at school but its nice to know that its there for people who want it changing your gender is a really shitty experience and people can be equally shitty so things like this that provide even a minor amount of respect is a good effort you think xe is imaginary rubbish and ive heard the same from people who think that way about trans people and i cant imagine many people want to hear that so i dont think itd be an epidemic or something
nottheonion,removed,what exactly do you think happens in a college classroom ive never seen or heard of this happening anywhere i feel like the people accusing others of making a big deal of things are the ones making things much more complicated than they actually are
nottheonion,removed,well memed my friend
nottheonion,removed,if youre being an asshole you target the things you say to hurt the person youre being an asshole to so you dont call skinny people fat or dick cheney a she thats how being an asshole works if youre just saying shit at random then its no longer being an asshole youve just started spouting non sequiturs
nottheonion,removed,its not courtesy to expect special treatment yes it is douchey for the same reason expecting someone to call you his majesty is douchey thats the exact point of this post to expect people to make special exceptions for you with pronouns or other language is a demonstration of entitlement not equality
nottheonion,removed,man its not even worth getting a headache over everybody knows theyre all pathetic fucking losers and im not going to sink to their level to brigade their sub because they have nothing better to do than troll everything that isnt pc it doesnt affect me whatsoever irl so im not going to let their petty childish shit do anything more than be something to laugh at and ridicule i used to care but i realized it was pretty unhealthy to get mad over people who get mad at everything on purpose theyre all losers and not worth the thought end of story its just like ignoring children theyll leave you alone eventually

nottheonion,removed,according to the consonant p doesnt exist in arabic f would be a decent approximation in those circumstances since theres some similarity to the way the sounds are produced both are labial consonants for example a lot of p words evolved into f words in germanic languages piscis being cognate with fish pater being cognate with father and so on

nottheonion,removed,people like you are the scum of the earth youre desperate to shift the conversation to a topic you think youre correct about and avoiding my actual comment at no point did i say anything about what a murderer should feel i commented on how we as society should view retribution morally also this manipulative bullshit were you pretend like you didnt understand the original commenters meaning when he said he hopes the father experiences regret everyday and he lives a long life the person is saying that he wants the person to feel tortured for as long as its possible to keep him alive and feeling that way and all the people who up voted that comment was thinking the same thing seriously youre human garbage
nottheonion,removed,shes an idiot theres no way to tell what shes giving to them anyone can poison these animals or the people who will consume them as well it wouldnt have been assault to hit the bottle away since she is basically not allowed to touch someone elses property which would be the truck as well as the pigs she thinks this is compassion how shes just ruining her name as well as the people who volunteer for their group to just being radicals that no one will listen to the law has to think of this in the broader prospect that if they allow her to do this then anyone else can do it as well and then god knows what will happen this is just plain stupidity and an attempt for publicity only this is going to be negative did she think by providing them water shes going to prevent them from being slaughtered those pigs are probably already dead

nottheonion,removed,it isnt reddit its people in general if you do think its redditleave youre just as caustic as the assholes who bullied her
nottheonion,removed,if you dont question the authenticity of rape you are just as bad or worse shit ton of males are blackmailed or flat out jailed for some woman they offended cried rape and without questioning it they were punished
nottheonion,removed,i mean if someone confided in me and asked for helpprotectionassistance because of a rape the last thing i would think of is questioning the authenticity of said actions i agree with your sentiment and hers that reddit has its share of incomprehensibly shameful people but let me ask you this if someone came to you and told you that your brother your father or a male friend you knew from a very young age had raped them would you believe that complete stranger entirely vs someone who youve known for a very long time there are valid reasons to ask questions and any suspect is innocent until found guilty
nottheonion,removed,thats the joke
nottheonion,removed,in other news black on white crime is regularly ignored by national media but once every few years a white on black crime occurs and its wall to wall coverage on every news channel and an entire cascade of community leaders come out and express shock very recently a group of black people attacked white people who asked them to stop sitting on their car they beat the hell out of them the black city council person said well they called that group of african americans the n word so the group was just defending themselves pretty insane and i guarantee none of you reading this comment right now are aware of the crime statistics hopefully it never happens to you or someone you know and you find out that way
nottheonion,removed,hahaha literally kill yourself
nottheonion,removed,what
nottheonion,removed,mlady thanks for the story tips hat
nottheonion,removed,isnt that the right mindset though we have due process for a reason nothing is official and no one is guilty until its proved in a court of law even though its fallible its still better than outright believing every accusation i think you can still have your doubts while still supporting the person through the process and then making your own final judgement at the end of said process
nottheonion,removed,you be no doctor you have no life i kill you now
nottheonion,removed,because there have been accusations of rape that turned out to be completely false on college campuses like the case with the duke mens lacross team or the one at columbia university so they see the false accusations and conclude that most females are lying about rape or that any rape that might have happened is circumstantial at best

nottheonion,removed,its not that being religious immediately makes you into a hateful moron its that the longer you remain religious the more likely it becomes that you become more and more hateful and moronic over time the people you see in the news are generally considered by their faith communities to be among the most faithful kim davis is a great example of that theres a reason that children raised without a religion are measurably more generous and compassionate than those raised with a religion religion itself is a negative influence on the psychological development and growth of human beings

nottheonion,removed,ring the repost bell
nottheonion,removed,no they said they told the parents they have a moral obligation you know or well find some thugs to hack you into little pieces fuck religion
nottheonion,removed,its straight out of the articlethe ruling said we inform parents that they are obligated to forbid their daughters from age five and up from acting in this illegitimate way wtf my point is that these mother fuckers want to force rules on those that are a part of their church this is only a small step away from a country that is predominantly muslim using sharia law to force their disgusting bullshit religious based fucked up laws on the believers whats even more fucked up is the people that live by those fucked up ignorant laws
nottheonion,removed,because its fucking retarded to insist on talking like a moron
nottheonion,removed,its projection they project their arousal or whatever theyre feeling onto their target we have quite a history of doing such had women keeping their oh so lascivious ankles covered at all times lest a poor chap lose control of himself to his beastly desires this rabbi is so fucked up in the head i see a kid on a bike i see a kid on a bike this guy sees a kid on the bike ands hes seeing something provocative which is another way of saying hes getting turned on so rather than get therapy he bans the object of his arousal and insinuates that all other men are similarly affected as well which is just a crock of shit
nottheonion,removed,how do you think think this stuff starts acceptance a group of people buy into the belief that this rabbis commands are literal law now bring on the kids riding bikesand some crazy follower decides to take things into their own hands my anger comes from reading all the crazy shit related to sharia law and now we hear the same kind of moral command coming from another religious nut im way more dangerous sorry dude no i do think for myself i do have a very basic and respectful moral compass that respects all life and individual life keep to yourself and were good but put me in a group listening to some fanatic preaching moral judgement id be the last to buy in and the first to call bs dangerous to the fanaticsyou bet im no sheep
nottheonion,removed,this rabbi is not a pedophile just an httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiharedijudaism asshole from the dark side of judaism where women have to cover themselves up to be modest and decent where gender separation is a thing and emancipation is not source am jewish
nottheonion,removed,thatll be why nobody else does it then keep fondling the baby dicks dude im sure its fine
nottheonion,removed,it is not a secret that most of muslims are okay with violence towards infidels and various kinds of primitive punishments against people who are bad in the eyes of the quran its really tough deciding who exactly is an extremist relatively to other religions since violence seems like a big part of the religion but i dont doubt a big percentage of muslims are peaceful people who disagree with certain view points of their religion like many other people who follow other religions and my view isnt racist since islam isnt a race its a religion saying all jews are stingy is racist since its a product of modern antisemitism that started in the century of course there are bad things in judaism for example the baby dick cutting which is constantly discussed in the media lately or the suppression of women in the orthodox community but frankly i never saw a rabbi behead someone like they do in dubai in the name of sharia again stop with the trash talking its nothing but pathetic
nottheonion,removed,oh ok so everytime we win its an error and everyone the house wins its just the way the cookie crumbles seems fair no wonder the casinos can afford to be so glamorous

nottheonion,removed,technically we can put everyone in padded rooms and not let them drive and have less car accidents doesnt mean is the right thing to do

nottheonion,removed,please read jill steins reasoning for leading this movement paste so obviously youre doing this in these three states that could swing the results of the election to hillary clinton and shes somebody who you have been very critical of in the past do you think the recount will shift the results does that mean you believe that a clinton presidency would be less harmful than a trump presidency let me start by saying that throughout the campaign i was often asked if there were concerns raised about the security and reliability of the vote would i challenge it and i always said absolutely without regard for who the winner was and i also refused throughout the campaign to say that i thought one candidate was preferable to the other in my mind both candidates are an expression of an election system that has been hijacked by the political and economic elite both candidates were not my candidate so i would be doing this no matter who won theres an article in this weeks black agenda report by bruce dixon a cochair of his green party in georgia it states really beautifully that the voting integrity movement is not about preferring one political party over another its about creating a politics that belongs to we the people that is the intent here we are not by any means confident this will change the election results in fact we believe it is highly unlikely to change the results but it will give us an answer one way or another on election integrity because academics activists and others are all very much convinced that our election system is extremely at risk
nottheonion,removed,theres a difference between not recognizing the results and asking for a recount d o g w h i s t l e

nottheonion,removed,youre like a helpless child seriously you spew bullshit but wont do jack shit to verify your claims or seek the truth why isnt the campaign doing a recount in any other state besides michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin election integrity experts have independently identified michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin as states where statistical anomalies raised concerns we would do recounts in other states but many filing deadlines have already passed recounts in states where deadlines have not passed would be considered if funds are available conducting research on state deadlines and requirements for filing is difficult work thats why wed appreciate your support in finding accurate data you can start at the citizens for election integrity minnesota

nottheonion,removed,some merit absolutely everybody has experienced that at some point you go there and realistically you know youre not going to get what you see in the commercial but you also expect to at least get what the menu shows number and type of pieces for example if you pay the price and are supposed to get say pieces breasts thighs drumsticks and you get tiny soggy wings that have stewed under a heat lamp for hours you have a genuine complaint however at best that should end with you getting reimbursed or getting what you paid for after complaining it absolutely does not equal million dollars that type of payout is and should be reserved for cases where death of a loved one is involved great bodily harmlifelong illness punitive damages for crimes done to you things like that court is about making you whole again the reason some cases pay huge is because you literally cannot be made whole again no matter what the court does so they try to hit the defendant as hard as possible and give you all they can in this case she can be made whole again verdict hope she enjoyed wasting the money on court costs the only way this could fly at all and even then it would be a tall order is if the menu didnt tell you differently than the commercial and you handed over your money with no available information telling you that it would not in fact be an overflowing bucket in fact i havent seen one in a while but id wager the commercials themselves probably have a disclaimer reflecting that too if you look at the menu its pretty clear it tells you exactly how many pieces youll get exactly which pieces youll get if you order that expecting it to be something different thats on you

nottheonion,removed,because we actually look like dudes and are dicks are longer than our pubic hairs im a in canada and a in japan
nottheonion,removed,i wonder if the media has something to do with this in the west black men are hyper masculinized and i mean younger women would choose to bed with tyrone who looks more unflattering compared to a clean cut college graduate yi and because theyre just not represented whose an asian male that actually has masculinity and hetero sexual prowess jackie chan no hed rather smile and do karate chops as his niche genes may play a role too most virgins like that grow up with video games and may mean adhd prone which can mean less motivation to take good nutrition so that they can at least be taller than five foot five women in their natural instincts would prefer to choose someone towering over them lol
nottheonion,removed,youd have success in china my wife tells me all the chinese bimbos these days just wanna fuck white guys even if they know theyre losers back home just so they can tell their friends they found an american guy not saying blue collar loser btw just saying go to china and wear a condom lol
nottheonion,removed,i think this is an issue in many developed countries including the us in the us women are more open to just having a one night stand if the guy is attractive enough even though they dont meet their expectations but beyond that it becomes much more difficult after your early if youre not doing great financially capitalism places a high value on your wealth and status and women are both looking at partners as material objects like a fashion accessory and someone who can guarantee they can live at least comfortably middle class but preferably beyond that and thats on top of looking good its reinforced in media asa well we just hear about the life of the rich and famous the tvfilm dramas typically revolve around the lives of the well off and its the same in east asia
nottheonion,removed,which is why their government is worried well im not i didnt want marriage anyway just some smash and dash see you fellas in tokyo

nottheonion,removed,i agree that were educating too many people i would liken it to giving individuals the supersoldier serum like in captain america the doctor only wanted to give it to steve because he knew he wouldnt turn into an idiot likewise give education to a stupid person and it just turns them into another kind of stupid person you would not believe how many educated people out there just regurgitate whatever they were taught or heard growing up and dont do any independent research on the subject they dont even trust what they see with their own eyes thats anecdotal experience that means nothing christ its disgusting
nottheonion,removed,its that and women having unrealistic expectations about men like in developed countries their minds have been warped through media and the way the economy works life is grand if youre well off but hell if not into thinking they must have some wealthy stud or else remain single until that guy comes along
nottheonion,removed,the us isnt much better tbh its maybe a few hours difference each week also like the us many somethings have no choice but to work part time jobs and they may have more free time than the salary guy but then comes the other issue like in the us where women only want to date someone that they think is successful and doing well financially
nottheonion,removed,wow looky here exhibit a hipster douche starts frothing at the mouth when i suggest the mere notion that we are educating too many people lol thats the conditioned response people expect from our society these days all i said was that educating stupid people doesnt make them any smarter its just makes them a different kind of stupid your kind of stupid snarky and hostile about everything shocker so many people are unmarried and single with this attitude im just saying
nottheonion,removed,the us office culture is very stressful as well japanese work culture has a reputation for being a lot of nonwork to keep up appearances where as in the us people work long hours due to the workload and understaffing not to keep up appearances though there are always positions like office manager and hr where they have a lot of time to kill and just shoot the shit around the office until their shift ends
nottheonion,removed,just reinforces my hate for the japanime weaboos or we white people who are obsessed with japan and shit nawm sayin whats up with that
nottheonion,removed,i think youre the one that cant read properly i never said that was your argument dude i said that i agree and added that educating too many people was a problem i never said outright that was your argument maybe you need to get out of the house more and find some friends youre pathetic there are a lot of people on reddit who have their heads up their asses because they dont get out much run along now boy

nottheonion,removed,im totaly on drenaline duuude
nottheonion,removed,good im tired of hearing women complaining about domestic abuse what happened to a stiff upper lip a stiff bloody upper lip s
nottheonion,removed,youre probably fun at parties
nottheonion,removed,a random person online made a joke about hitting women so clearly that means i should start doing it then right said no one ever
nottheonion,removed,me thinks that knuckle draggers have things in common beating women and being influenced by strangers on the internet in regards to beating women
nottheonion,removed,quran men are the maintainers of women because allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property the good women are therefore obedient guarding the unseen as allah has guarded and as to those on whose part you fear desertion admonish them and leave them alone in the sleepingplaces and beat them then if they obey you do not seek a way against them surely allah is high great
nottheonion,removed,this is very different from the usa where women beat men
nottheonion,removed,because they are
nottheonion,removed,end yourself you ignorant racist shit
nottheonion,removed,western women secretly longing to be treated like this has got to be the mother of all ironies not by those evil white nonchad creeps mind you were not good enough to beat them
nottheonion,removed,thats morroco for you top blokes over there integrate it into our culture its lovely
nottheonion,removed,from wikipedia morocco official religion islam oh well that explains so much
nottheonion,removed,islam baby
nottheonion,removed,reminds me of family guy episode with gleens sister one of the most cringist episode ever it was so bad i actually wanted her to die im sorry
nottheonion,removed,tldr hes a black
nottheonion,removed,by the same logic anyone fired from a job because of marijuana is a drug addict yes they obviously did not prioritize their general wellbeing of for the sake of doing a drug exactly how about someone who falls asleep on the road and kills a child because they are working late did they have a work addiction or did they make a poor choice there is no sufficient data to confirm or discard the possibility so im not offended youre just being a pretentious moron trying to say everyone who has a dui had an alcohol addiction you can insult my character you can mock my opinions but you cannot change the facts if someone knowingly and willingly drives while inebriated despite how percussive our society is regarding awareness of how dangerous and illegal it is that is the behaviour of an addict you can always call a cab you can always take a bus you can always spend the night where you are or sleeping in the car driving under the influence is never justified and anyone who does is and should be treated as an addict
nottheonion,removed,really how is this not oniony
nottheonion,removed,look i was with someone drinking and driving recently and they arent addicted they just had to get home
nottheonion,removed,driving drunk is a terrible thing to do but addiction is defined by withdrawal
nottheonion,removed,thats a nice sentiment but just because you dont understand the actual mentality behind it doesnt mean that ypur false assumptions are the only possible explanations
nottheonion,removed,do you have any support for that argument
nottheonion,removed,those people dont have enough impulse control to be drinking
nottheonion,removed,so every time you look at the mirror you know who you are staring at looking all badass who the fuck is namyaw bastard thinks he can break into my house and steal my face
nottheonion,removed,you are in the real world dumbass
nottheonion,removed,id have given him about three fiddy seriously though i hope the buyer turns it on zimmerman and pulls the trigger
nottheonion,removed,yea or slinging dope more likely
nottheonion,removed,stand their ground
nottheonion,removed,zimmerman was treated very unfairly from the start with extreme prejudice hate by the media the left society can easily change its direction of prejudice hate but getting rid of its stripes is a much different thing to do entirely
nottheonion,removed,all media including reddit demonised this person from day of the shooting it is also very clear that martin was not the angel he was made out to be if i were rich id buy that gun for million bucks zimmerman deserves all of this and more i hope he continues to troll the american people for the rest of his life and fuck reddit for ruining his life
nottheonion,removed,so what is it a boy or an abortion just saying
nottheonion,removed,to be fair no one actually knows wether zimmerman stopped following or not
nottheonion,removed,aka americans
nottheonion,removed,for a sub about lampooning the news i have to say if feels like you guys are incredibly strict on what makes it through i dont think ive ever had a post make it through without being deleted for some lame reason like not oniony enough which but your rules own admission is highly subjective and encouraged to be addressed by votes first and foremost or that you wont accept sources ive submitted for example from reputable hollywood trade papers and you guys think that theyre tabloids its really frustrating to want to contribute to a community only to be met with a wall of seemingly really strict rules that dont encourage people to contribute i doubt with an active board or million subs you or the rest of the mods will care but i just wanted to tell you that and that i probably wont bother contributing to this sub anymore so thanks
nottheonion,removed,one you fuckers actually decided to do itworthlesslitterallyjust sleep in the dumpster tonightall of you

nottheonion,removed,f l e e n s t o n e s
nottheonion,removed,im calling sabotage
nottheonion,removed,what are you talking about whats subjective is the interviewees opinion not the evaluation are you suggesting the authors evaluated answers and interpreted them as referring to richard dawkins when they might not have what exactly is subjective about noting peoples answers in an interview
nottheonion,removed,oh so like bruce jenner
nottheonion,removed,theres nothing to know its all bullshit i think there is a marked difference between handing out a book cw some rather ott claims from some reports and having access to books in general there are lots of interest groups advertisers political agendas religions cults and so on that might all get in line to dish out books to impressionable children given the opportunity i dont think thats a good thing to encourage or promote that as a way of disseminating information regardless of whether or not you do or dont agree with whatever bullshit their book is spouting
nottheonion,removed,dawkins does act like he knows everything when asked the question what was before the big bang and where did reality come from he has no answers nobody does so stop acting so high and mighty science is based on what we can see and thats it so who knows what reality actually is not saying it was a god but who knows he sure doesnt
nottheonion,removed,more
nottheonion,removed,exactly what dr king fought and died for smh
nottheonion,removed,the problem with that is that most sketchy or outright dangerous neighborhoods are also very low tipping democrat neighborhoods and it is against corporate policy to refuse delivery solely because of no tip if they allowed people not to deliver when they felt unsafe then there would be a lot of abuse of that loophole to get out of taking an empty run however once someone gets robbed or if someone is almost robbed under suspicious circumstances then the store is allowed to blacklist a complex or neighborhood i love the remark about not carrying weapons as if that matters to anyone after a delivery driver was hospitalized in the town where i was almost every driver old enough to get a ccw permit got one with a cheap pistol and decided that if they ever had to use it they would just move on to a new line of work everyone was discrete around management but the managers were also sympathetic enough not to care as long as they had plausible deniability a waist bulge was always a pacemaker or an insulin pump and no one got fired unless they deliberately exposed it
nottheonion,removed,its because of people like him that robbers think delivery drivers are good targets if every time a delivery driver got robbed they had dollars or less on them they wouldnt get robbed as much
nottheonion,removed,httpsdominospizzapissedconsumercomcustomerservicehtml
nottheonion,removed,hes suggesting rich people on average tip better which is correct and rich people also tend to lean conservative which is also correct
nottheonion,removed,have you delivered food before
nottheonion,removed,i was a papa johns driver at a store where just a year before one of our drivers was killed in a robbery the robbers got something like out of it then shot him and left him to die

nottheonion,removed,successful troll is once again successful
nottheonion,removed,not so much the actual name is not known the current republic of ghana was changed from the gold coast to ghana by kwame nkrumah when they gained their independence in the late the first of the african nations to do so the republic of ghana is named after the medieval ancient ghana empire of west africa the actual name of the empire was wagadugu ghana was the title of the kings who ruled the kingdom it was controlled by sundiata in ad and absorbed into the larger mali empire home to the infamous mansa musa those who believe ghanaians descended from northwest which is in agreement with why the name was change from gold coast to ghana say that the name ghana has some similarities in certain cultures around ghana some believe that ghana is a compound word gana which means warrior king which is a word derived from ouagadougou this will mean that ghanaians are originally from burkina faso where we can find traces of such semantic phrase further they also believe that there are huge similarities in culture history language etc the ga and akan cultures and languages are also a part of ghana source this is what was taught at the university of ghana when i studied abroad there in in addition in the george padmore library in ghana youll find a lot of resources baking this its highly debatable but theres no concrete evidence to support your claim the h was moved in the word for various reasons by dr kwame nkrumah the people who formed the ghana kingdom were the soninke and it is said the arabs named it ghana though the soninke called themselves wagadu this is ancient ghana of course which is in a different place geographically from current ghana ancient ghana was absorbed from the mali empire nkrumah when gaining independence changed the name with dr j b danquah from gold coast to ghana
nottheonion,removed,can you imagine if their aim was slightly off and then youre just walking down the street by the border and then a cocaine missile explodes right in front of you covering everything with the yay i imagine the random people would go nuts similar to corky ramono

nottheonion,removed,old biff even return to the future timeline after marty returned back to it would be a shame if he had changed the future
nottheonion,removed,this is not a legit news source sorry but dont believe the story
nottheonion,removed,because the person who ended his shift due to excessive hours wouldnt be a reliable source aka the dude that doesnt want to be fired is trying to protect himself yeah thats real surprising there is no way to please you man apparently this has effected your personal life in such a traumatic way you should probably get a therapist you might be autistic there kid maybe youre right and every news source is lying the news source is only reporting what he said its not lying whether he was at the limit or not thats kinda basic logic

nottheonion,removed,i think the señor doth protest too much
nottheonion,removed,well maybe someone should be if the driver left during the middle of a regular shift then maybe it should be the driver he entirely left in the middle of his regularly scheduled shift if you dispute that then the rest of the conversation is kinda pointless because you dont think he left at all which is impressive that did not happen here lol you believe the guy who doesnt want to get fired so no its not necessarily a good enough reason for someone to be fired til fucking people over because you dont want to do your job isnt a good reason to fire someone have you ever held a job
nottheonion,removed,drivers for uber the app touted as the killer of the taxi industry suddenly get outraged when the wind of themselves being phased out in due time hits them and proceed to act in the same outraged manner as cabbies did about their market presence before how is this not oniony
nottheonion,removed,last year i tried getting a flight home wearing a jacket i hadnt worn since the christmas before put it through the security scanner and got pulled are these yours the security guy asked there was a pack of miniature screwdrivers in my breast pocket never seen them before i said they were confiscated it was only as i sat on the plane that i remembered pulling them from a christmas cracker six months before thinking the fuck am i gonna do with miniature screwdrivers and storing them in my jacket pocket they were under inches long but long enough to inject me with the fear of being latexglove raped
nottheonion,removed,you got downvoted because you criticized the democrats money machine they rake of that budget directly into their campaign coffers dont say that private schools would be preferable because democrats cant skim money off of those

nottheonion,removed,i cant wait until donald gets morons like you to leave the country youre about as smart as lump of smoosh you fruit
nottheonion,removed,youve got to love the liberal dissonance cheryl courtneyevans railed against dillard smith saying she should stfu calling her a bitch and stupid as sht these people continue to display their disrespect really and heres little old me thinking that calling someone a bitch and stupid as shit is a lot more disrespectful than saying that the rights of the vast majority of people notably small children trump the rights of the approximately of the population who are mentally ill in that particular way
nottheonion,removed,funny how people remind us that those savage are our equals
nottheonion,removed,not a chance alcohol abuse is a serious issue and will be punished accordingly it isnt just some simple child molestation or something

nottheonion,removed,youre a fucking dick and this is a social networking link aggregation site a couple of stories are ok for the informal discussions here were not recording incidents for a court of law fucking relax
nottheonion,removed,just because somethings legal doesnt make it right try reading again slower this time locking people up in cages or in this case killing them just because they choose to do something that has effect on you is just insane and immoral again try rereading again slower this time
nottheonion,removed,yeah but i have more respect for npr than i do for some fascist bootlicker on reddit you should enlist when trump starts a war hopefully youll die

nottheonion,removed,this lady made the classic mistake of being poor while black america will forgive you for one especially if you are white or really good at sports but not both
nottheonion,removed,which is why im totally ok with what happened to all those sub human pigs in dallas
nottheonion,removed,and single moms dont happen in a vacuum it takes to make a baby
nottheonion,removed,its you dumbass dumb fuck illiterate distasteful prick of a cop and human being
nottheonion,removed,keep calm kill cops
nottheonion,removed,since there have been cops convicted of onduty murder or manslaughter thats out of easily people killed by police in that time is a very conservative estimate because in case you werent aware cops routinely kill or so americans on a yearly basis do you really in your heart of hearts believe that this is a reasonable number of people charged with murder or is the amount of cop jizz you ingest starting to clog your brain and affect your critical thinking abilities
nottheonion,removed,this is exactly what id expect from ca
nottheonion,removed,right im a white blue collar worker in the uk been forced out of several jobs by economic immigrant colleagues back when i was a nice guy now im a born again racist walk in my shoes for a while and you will no doubt change the same way
nottheonion,removed,uhhhh that tweet says israel defence minister makes threat you might wanna check yourself before pakistan threatens to nuke you over these false threats
nottheonion,removed,the fact that we allow a muslim country to have nuclear weapons strikes me as insane pakistans nuclear weapons should be destroyed as soon as possible along with all nuclear facilities they were hiding bin laden what the hell are we doing letting them have nukes
nottheonion,removed,uh no i dont mind other countries having nuclear weapons but any country that worships a warlord child rapist needs to have them taken away right away
nottheonion,removed,

nottheonion,removed,having gone to court a few times in texas cowboy boots are totally acceptable this is not very oniony for me
nottheonion,removed,wellits nice for a year old girl and the internet and the media to impose what a good english name is and what isnt whats wrong with gandalf it was good enough for gandalf unless theyre calling their babies dickwad or bigvagina let them call their babies bingbing or dollar or jerry nobody owns english and when they get to doing business at an international level anyone whose parents gave them a stupid name isnt going to be dumb enough to have it printed on a business card anyway and even if they do so fucking what id rather live a world where chinese parents named their children instead of some year old girl in the uk
nottheonion,removed,ching chongs are pathetic only less than the white males you marry them like seriously you marry someone with the body of a year old boy no tits no ass

nottheonion,removed,a person can make a false statement and it can technically be an alternate fact because its true they said that its a fact they said that and its alternate to what occurred i get what shes saying
nottheonion,removed,that troll that a bunch of dumb hicks and low iq conspiracy theory nutbags thought was real because they heard critical thinking and thought that means its bad to think
nottheonion,removed,obama did the exact same thing in
nottheonion,removed,well the story of can be a bit triggering for some people republicans will hate the scene with george w then again even democrats will likely be uneasy at hillary clintons scenes do you have what it takes to read
nottheonion,removed,do i need to call for you with so little effort im starting to worry about if youre alive or not
nottheonion,removed,no they were myths idiots like you believed we are fucked now with trump as president i hope you and the fucks like you all die and suffer

nottheonion,removed,i think this might be better for rrage or something than here every paragraph of this story gets worse and worse like i want to snark about their noahs ark comment or the fact that they want levitical rules but i bet anything they dont keep kosher too but i cant because its just too sick sad and rageinducing
nottheonion,removed,im sure both of us have better things to do amen to that i cant let you go without calling you a dick though for wasting my time and insulting so have a good one asshole
nottheonion,removed,it is a slur and you dont have a fucking clue what youre talking about which seems to be the theme for all your comments
nottheonion,removed,newfie and newf have a history as a insult you ignorant idiot those others do not
nottheonion,removed,are you seriously implying that shooting them is better it is if youre as close to them as you are when clubbing them one club smack and the seal is dead youve watched too many action movies were people can take a good beating now this is bullshit i live in newfoundland near where seal hunting takes place and they are certainly not dead immediately every time many are alive when skinned if not conscious if you dont like it you can give them jobs pay their sallary and pay for their transsportation and new home because there sure as hell isnt any other job but killing seals up there for them then they can fucking move or take advantage of whatever social safety net is available to them keep in mind i live in one of these communities and anyone with two brain cells to rub together soon realizes if they cant make a living here they need to move elsewhere industries wax and wane all the time thats life no one is entitled to live someplace they ultimately cant afford youre an ignorant bigot lol
nottheonion,removed,i dunno your mom was pretty tasty last night she just kept screening oh yeah right there eat me alive ive had better though
nottheonion,removed,oh wow that sucks she must be dealing with a lot of pain and suffering in her morbidly obese condition does she know how much her son likes others suffering though thats gotta sting from her own child
nottheonion,removed,my fucking god the logic of reddit at it again we kill every day so much more animals pigs cows horses chickens we even kill baby animals in the thousands nobody really cares but if this people club a few tousands baby seals somehow its wrong because they look cute bitch please you idiots allow muslims to slaughter animals their way which means they get their throat cut open and then they bleed to death alive do you know how we knock animals out before we slaughter them well mayn people do it by hitting them on the head with something heave which knocks them out and this guys even have a hook at the end to make the death even faster so this things wont feel a thing they get knocked out bevore any pain starts but of course this faggot animals look cute so its bad
nottheonion,removed,you idiot lmao

nottheonion,removed,but you didnt say that you said american meaning american as a whole
nottheonion,removed,i disagree its not our responsibility and if anything such burdens to society should just be euthanized

nottheonion,removed,fake news
nottheonion,removed,trump is your president dealwithit ukreius
nottheonion,removed,id be throwing that foolio a toaster in the bathtub
nottheonion,removed,there are trump apologists who would dismiss the false things trump said as not borne out of malice but ignorance this is of course contradicted by the testimony of people who interacted with trump many of whom noted his casual indifference to the truth
nottheonion,removed,crap comment upset trumpette troll
nottheonion,removed,lmfao youre so stupid
nottheonion,removed,isnt dc full of black liberals it doesnt seem like even some other republican being sword in would have little impact on the crowds bush had only slightly larger crowds
nottheonion,removed,dumb fucks in the media think they can get away with their bullshit not today no more fucking dumb liberal bullshit from this president get used to it snowflakes
nottheonion,removed,a bunch of pissed off sore losers mad that they were straight dropped on all fours and fucked sideways out of every single level of this election season and their party is now dead and irrelevant this thread
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,hey uleftrise this is now the top post on reddit it will be recorded at rtopofreddit with all the other top posts
nottheonion,removed,and cnn at least attempts to be nonpartisan no it doesnt lol chance anyone there concrete example find an article in which brietbart lied oh right you cant
nottheonion,removed,oh look a trump supporter poisoning the well by calling facts fake news fuck you youre a piece of garbage and the us would be a better place without you people like you will be the actual end to this country
nottheonion,removed,like the context of you being wrong
nottheonion,removed,people only went to obamas inaug cause it was historic everyone was dick ridin obama nobodies interested in trump like of other inaugs
nottheonion,removed,knowing the capacity of a venue isnt the same as having a count of the attendees
nottheonion,removed,did you watch the video
nottheonion,removed,consider the random person was a reporter for cnn also consider dont comment you dont meet the required iq level
nottheonion,removed,you are a national embarrassment source me
nottheonion,removed,you guys are all morons surely youve something better to do than criticize half of your fellow americans for supporting a political stance other than your own
nottheonion,removed,first your questionable source second the proof you linked is another article calling it fake news third brietibart sourced everything in that article from local news so its real or as real as anywhere can hope to be not that you bothered to do your own research but yeah its common for dumb people to try for appeal to majority or appeal to authority basically you are a dumbass
nottheonion,removed,has reddit and reddit mods always been this insufferable
nottheonion,removed,just being nitpicky but i think you mean amerikaner uber alles to an englishspeakers ear they sound the same but thats just the germans swallowing the r like the british do
nottheonion,removed,yes trump thinks so too like obama said theyre not syncophants they should be skeptics
nottheonion,removed,spoiler alert for anyone bored enough to talk to this moron hes never going to believe its accurate
nottheonion,removed,nope and still trolling your asses
nottheonion,removed,ive run out of adjectives wrote chuck todd the moderator of nbcs meet the press i watched your election night coverage chuck and you were laughing and having a good time at how unbelievable the whole thing was it was a big game and a lot of fun still enjoying it now chuck
nottheonion,removed,hope they start pulling press passes for those trying to pass off fake news as truth
nottheonion,removed,holy fuck regardless of the size of the crowd the widely circulated picture from yesterday comparing trumps crowd to obamas was misleading as the trump pic was taken early in the morning reddit can we fucking not turn every sub into an antitrump circlejerk for the duration god fucking damn also if mods were doing their jobs this would be removed
nottheonion,removed,probably shouldnt feed the trolls trump
nottheonion,removed,including video he is correct the best and only kind of correct
nottheonion,removed,stop stop for fucks sake stop no one say anything it cant happen if we dont say it cant happen
nottheonion,removed,are you telling me that the first black president liberal to be inaugurated in the district of columbia with a drew larger crowds than the a white president elected overwhelmingly by working class citizens on a friday business day inauguration mind blowing
nottheonion,removed,the sentiment you people share is getting really old now so many comparisons to hitler are you fucking serious youre all acting like children at this rate trump actually has a serious voter base in the black and mexican communities and says he wants to deport illegals and you children go on about it like hes hitler trying to gas people the only violence ive seen so far is the left attacking people because they didnt get their way look up a video from the election day and see how vicious democratic youth has become you all pray on every move trump makes but when its the media or the dnc fucking up that shit just floats on by like it never happened in order to behave this way you people are either completely bias from watching to much cnn or youre thicker than housebricks you can whinge and bitch until the cows come home but trump is still your president
nottheonion,removed,wah wah wah wah you lol
nottheonion,removed,the definition robert paxton uses in his stages of fascism fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity energy and purity in which a massbased party of committed nationalist militants working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion sound familiar it hits many of the marks to me the underlying attitude is definitely there at least
nottheonion,removed,thought criminal
nottheonion,removed,cnns just butt hurt because their onion is literally shit
nottheonion,removed,sorry to break it to you but shes an idiot none of your excuses for her make any sense and especially as a woman supporting trump wtf
nottheonion,removed,russia never did anything to me kind of like the vietnam protests no vietnamese ever called me a nigger bah vietnam is ancient history
nottheonion,removed,so is rnotheonion allowing overtly political submissions then like every other nonpolitical subreddit that suddenly turned reddit into a political shithole great work mods i appreciate having absolutely nowhere to escape politics on reddit
nottheonion,removed,just keep spouting your narrative little shill
nottheonion,removed,ugly privileged white woman protesting about how oppressed they are in the west when in places like saudi arabia female genital mutilation is practiced and morocco they had a tv program show how to hide beatings from your husband why are they not going to these countries to help these women
nottheonion,removed,lol sorry but i would say most people arent like that your wife sounds insufferable
nottheonion,removed,but its fake news really dont pay attention to anyone but us theyre lying rigged fake sad
nottheonion,removed,try a video
nottheonion,removed,no i refuse to tiptoe around these fools the time for that is over
nottheonion,removed,well if her ideologies aligned more closely with trump then ill add shes a racist misogynist fascist and has the iq of a root vegetable is that better
nottheonion,removed,its because all of the people standing on the ground covering were provided white jumpsuits and white hats so you cant see them from silly photographs
nottheonion,removed,salty cucks gon be salty ¯ツ¯
nottheonion,removed,good trolling
nottheonion,removed,if the blackies and stinkies make ingress impossible thats just a fact of physical barriers lil fellar keep learnin
nottheonion,removed,are you blind
nottheonion,removed,actually the press secretary was correct and cnn did also falsely report the bust of mlk had been removed a thread started by someone with the handle left rise carrying the biased medias water shocker
nottheonion,removed,admins allowing yet another antitrump thread oh sooooooo edgy
nottheonion,removed,trump is all over the news people cant stop talking about him if you want people to stop giving a shit stop making stories about him let him fade into obscurity stop feeding him
nottheonion,removed,i saw pics of the crowd that told a different story than what the media showed i suppose timing is everything lets face it this is a double standard loyal democrat followers would have been outraged had fox news run a segment where they said bush could stay in power if obama were assassinated right before inauguration cnn does it with trump and its real news
nottheonion,removed,then get off this site and troll breitbart or pol you asshat
nottheonion,removed,who gives a shit about the crowd size even if people showed up guess what trumps still president you crybabies
nottheonion,removed,it feels like theyre trying to desensitize us to their lies
nottheonion,removed,accurately you guys are truly delusional trump had thousand people at his inauguration lmao
nottheonion,removed,welp i tried
nottheonion,removed,nwo
nottheonion,removed,cnn is fucking gay
nottheonion,removed,if you have people in fucking antarctica protesting you you know you fucked up big time
nottheonion,removed,fuck you
nottheonion,removed,it was also raining
nottheonion,removed,that bitch sucks
nottheonion,removed,cnn is fucking gay
nottheonion,removed,and it was fucking raining
nottheonion,removed,most americans voted for clinton honestly dude even fox is shocked at some of the shit trump is pulling you and the rest of his supporters got conned
nottheonion,removed,you can very clearly tell that the majority of the open space in that photo is filled with people from the cnn gigapixel link theres some open space near that housing enclosure in the back and right in front of it on the right side and some other blank space that i cant tell is blank due to lack of people or is purposefully left as so due to some waist fences there i understand you hate trump and whatnot but thats no reason to be completely stupid
nottheonion,removed,not to mention is was raining
nottheonion,removed,lol wait you must be one of the online goons that hillary literally pays to fight rational thought i get it no point in arguing
nottheonion,removed,sorry completely misinterpreted your comment i thought you meant that the msm was brainwashing clinton supports and that you were saying most americans voted for trump
nottheonion,removed,troll
nottheonion,removed,what they report facts he tells lies he claims that they are fighting a war against him because they dont regurgitate his bullshit why would they be on the side of a man who hates them
nottheonion,removed,back troll back nobody wants you here anymore
nottheonion,removed,this is a bald face fucking lie on the medias part this video does not show the truth it shows the first part and then the last part thats fucking it it took longer because of all the dumb ass liberal protesters for people to get in this video is a complete fucking sham now this is how you lie to the populace just like with the mlk bust show the missing fucking scenes not the first and last parts
nottheonion,removed,just like the republicandemocrat flip that happened during the that meant that the party of lincoln was comprised of exactly the population he had fought against i see this tired argument thrown around all the time the term national socialism arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of socialism as an alternative to both international socialism and free market capitalism nazism rejected the marxist concept of class struggle opposed cosmopolitan internationalism and sought to convince all parts of a new german society to subordinate their personal interests to the common good and to accept the priority of political interests in economic organisation wikipedia on nazism they literally rejected all of the marxist literatureyou know socialism and tried to reclaim the term socialism as their own the bolsheviksthe soviet unionrussians were founded on marxist idealssocialist ideals and they hated the nazis with all of their being now unfortunately for the bolsheviks their idealistic base was quickly scrapped for a state capitalism based oligarchy but i digress socialism and fascism are seen as close to complete opposites as can be fascism is a form of authoritarian nationalism a totalitarian oneparty state system based on protecting a nation defined through race ancestry religion sexuality etc it pushes the notion that their nation is the best promoting cults of unity strength and purity it is very exclusionary historically exiling deporting jailing maiming or slaughtering people that tainted the nationunwanted races religions lgbtq ancestry among others socialism is far more complicated and there are many different veins of it much of the socialism the world has seen has not actually followed the tenets of what it is supposed to meanlike the contemporary oligarchy that is china or the oigarchy that was the soviet union wikipedia i think sums up the basics pretty easily socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production as well as the political ideologies theories and movements that aim to establish them social ownership may refer to forms of public collective or cooperative ownership to citizen ownership of equity or to any combination of these although there are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of themsocial ownership is the common element shared by its various forms most socialist systems are based on the theories of karl marx who espoused an inclusive governmental system in which the proletariatthe working class would rise up against the bourgeoisiethe ruling class and seize the means of production his ideas criticize capitalism as exploitative he believed in raising all non ruling people up especially those who had been most exploited by capitalism like women and minorities these ideas differ radically from anything remotely fascist
nottheonion,removed,their klan robes blend into the white tarps
nottheonion,removed,such bias shouldnt have done this fuck your political alignment i hate the guy too but god is this immature especially coming from a moderator of a massive subreddit
nottheonion,removed,uoozles supports rape
nottheonion,removed,yes they defend themselves when attacked by the leader of the free world actively trying to undermine them by lying and you resort to ad hominem attacks to belittle them
nottheonion,removed,because they assassinate people in london and decided our presidential election funding jill stein alone was enough to decide it even without all the paid trolls
nottheonion,removed,trump is so salty about having no mandate he doesnt even have enough supporters willing to fill the capitol mall for him meanwhile antitrump protests are having larger turnouts at the mall and in cities in the us and globally i guess its tough to fill the capital mall with online russian shills and bots how incredibly embarrassing for trump and rthedonald the history books are going to remember trump as an inept clown with a huge asterisk next to his name at least all this idiocy is galvanizing the opposition liberal turnout should be record high in and i wouldnt be surprised if this is the beginning of the end for the republican party
nottheonion,removed,sure and he should do it by telling the truth this wouldnt be an issue if him and his team didnt lie so blatantly and recklessly
nottheonion,removed,tell me about it im half hispanic and the only people that i hear are revving up race relations are the blacks the slavs jews arabs hispanics and asians all get along fine here in fl the blacks that have been indoctrinated by the left seemingly cant work through the differences and brand any successful black man or woman an uncle tom im sick of the racial divide
nottheonion,removed,lot of conservatives folks are technophobes and almost illiterate regarding computers so they think nobody will notice their lies they had no clue how internet work for them its a magic mysterious blackbox they were accustomed to lie easily with the press and tv before the net they are stuck in forever even hillary was like that when she lied and flipflopped but i admit trump is so idiot and overall illiterate even hillary is a genius with computer compared to trump look at the fear in his eyes in front of a computer we can see that he is not sure what to do hilarious and sad at the same time
nottheonion,removed,mods can you please confirm
nottheonion,removed,king cuck
nottheonion,removed,this is a troll account i think because the post is still up
nottheonion,removed,so this is officially rtheonion because this is horse shit for a post title fuck the mods for allowing such fake titles
nottheonion,removed,it was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration period both in person and around the globe sorry im not getting it is this accurate or not everyone seems focused on the number of people in live attendance which would be the smallest number to consider when talking abut global views
nottheonion,removed,its a literal hugbox they post feelgood news stories that conform to their narrative and delete postsban users who try to go against the insanity one of the sidebar rules even says this is a subreddit for donald trump supporters only pathetic
nottheonion,removed,you just have to be civil i got into a stupid argument about that pizza gate crap and got banned im being about as civil to them as im being to you right now
nottheonion,removed,fucking fascist white piece of shit
nottheonion,removed,congrats youre a racist fascist and a bigot are you white by chance i have a long black cock id like to slide into ur tight puckered asshole
nottheonion,removed,and why are you changing the subject
nottheonion,removed,you fucking dummys well one thing i made up off the top of my head is false but that doesnt matter
nottheonion,removed,thats why he still thinks he has big hands
nottheonion,removed,im sorry factual evidence is so hard for you to analyze
nottheonion,removed,whats your point sure some countries are worse as far as that goes but it is just as easy for you to be arrested for any truly radical speech in the us also sure ill concede that free speech is a good thing in most contexts but allowing nazis to threaten minorities because everyone should be able to state their opinion is tacit support of fascism
nottheonion,removed,well it was fake news that the media put out and incredibly divisive liberals just arent used to the right fighting back against their bully tactics and misinformation when the leftist bubble is pierced it feels like an attack you cant take a picture of the trump early day inauguration and put it side by side with a different inauguration but at the swearing in moment where the crowd is at its largest and claim thats proof no one showed up we all saw the same video of trump at the swearing in its max capacity crowd i really didnt see much of a real difference from other times pretending to be stupid and blind to smear trump isnt a winning tactic also the mlk bust thing what a disgusting act by the media to pretend trump had it removed as his first act as president you all ought to be ashamed to even want to push something that divisive just so you can make some political hay out of a lie
nottheonion,removed,how did they get there surely not public transportation did they all walk into dc
nottheonion,removed,chock it up to being a retard that believes everything he hears then kill yourself
nottheonion,removed,another russian troll
nottheonion,removed,hillary and trump actually won things tho
nottheonion,removed,and how is this a defence from you getting butthurt about people correcting the factual errors of the press secretary is it by design you acuse others of the shit you did a comment ago or is it just a lucky streak in your bad atempt at trolling
nottheonion,removed,im looking at the crowd pic cnn and other leftist media stations and personalities kept showing during trumps speech and comparing it to the gigapixel of trumps speech and they just arent lining up im either missing something or they were putting in an earlier crowd pic to mislead people like i said vs
nottheonion,removed,how about you deal with it when the police beat your ass and through you in jail lets hope they knock a few teeth out when they do so
nottheonion,removed,going to be a long four years or impeachment whichever comes first for this troll
nottheonion,removed,engrish know not you do
nottheonion,removed,thats a lovely false equivalency fallacy you have there well done your mother must be proud of your total lack of critical thinking skill and inability to form a reasoned argument
nottheonion,removed,you said a lot of them supported hitler i asked how many is a lot so youve named two and then flipped out dodging the question with misdirection reinterpretation and insults so you dont know but wont admit it because that wouldnt support your attempt to have us associate trump with nazis forgive me if i think youve cost yourself all credibility here
nottheonion,removed,coming from a guy whos best comeback is a false equivalency fallacy right back atcha bud right back atcha you keep flunking those iq tests like a boss
nottheonion,removed,i go down on your mother all the time cumstain i might even be your real daddy for all i know in other news yes it is a false equivalency since youre too busy coming up with clever comebacks to use your brain for something other than a doorstop ill lay it out for you a horse has no legal standing in a us court it also has no ability to comprehend the concept get it good
nottheonion,removed,yea because mexicans only work in agriculture and hospitality you racist piece of shit
nottheonion,removed,i have a final solution for you just delete your account your altright brethren prefer tumblr anyway
nottheonion,removed,hes suing people for saying theyll do shit and then not following through theres a difference yall think that its cool to go after people when theres no consequences to you for doing so maybe you should take a long hard look at your behaviour in light of the fact that some of this shit you do might have consequences thats what this is about
nottheonion,removed,the simple fact is that the electoral college divides votes by population but states get a minimum of three votes if your state would only deserve by population then your citizens votes in that state count as three peoples votes in any other state a state that gets votes due to population being that high anyway
nottheonion,removed,what a convenient double standard you have there if on the other hand trump had said he would pay bill maher million for x and then bill maher followed through and actually did it and demanded his money youd all be demanding for trump to pay up and theres no way in hell youd accept its just satire as a dense from trump so i get it im just calling out a double standard
nottheonion,removed,she got votes less than obama she got million more votes than sanders and million more than trump if is way way less then whats million
nottheonion,removed,so by your own way of counting sanders got completely destroyed
nottheonion,removed,biased moderators for the win this wouldve been removed in minutes under a liberal inauguration lmao
nottheonion,removed,umm
nottheonion,removed,i like how you guys give out fake news youve gathered from twitter and ignore real facts just to support your narratives totally ignore the fact about the mlk bust that was totally fabricated and destroyed by real news whyd you leave that out i mean you guys worship the media right
nottheonion,removed,to be fair those statements arent mutually exclusive it doesnt necessarily mean they are or arent true but it would be at least theoretically possible for it to be obvious that it was the most wellattended just by looking at it while there was still no way to know the exact number of people who attended
nottheonion,removed,going through this comment section noticing that everything that isnt liberal gets down voted because they are so closed minded that they hate hearing others opinions
nottheonion,removed,you are now moderator of eh fuck it
nottheonion,removed,trump is historically unpopular and he lost the popular vote by million not sure why its inconceivable that he had a small turnout also worth pointing out that his power base is almost entirely oxycodoneaddicted hillbillies who spend all the money they earned stealing wires from abandoned buildings on either more oxycodone or diet faygo gotta be healthy from now on its my new years resolution these people have never been outside their little meth bubbles and the thought of going to the wicked city of washington to see their lord and savior turn beetred with exertion from having to swear an oath overwhelms their small minds most of the inaugural crowd was probably just bored protesters drawn out of morbid curiosity after reading his tweets for six months why not hear what kind of ignorant diarrhea will spill out of the guys mouth when hes in front of the us capitol
nottheonion,removed,having instant knowledge at your fingertips also means you have instant lies available as well guess which section the trumpers willl decide to beleivewhats needed is actualy a massive global fact checker on the internet that pushes inaccuracy of the seasrch engines and if sites continualy missinform people shuts them downthe problem is anyone with finance can put out any conspiritard antivax birther breitbart faux news bullshit they like on the web and there is zero to stop them
nottheonion,removed,not violent enough
nottheonion,removed,try again hombre nothing in my statement says dont look at trump it just says quit being a hypocrite as in yall were happy with the way the media treated yalls guy and hitlary for years but now that the tables have turned yall finally want real journalism back its funny not really though its sad and pathetic i welcome it all the time not just half the time
nottheonion,removed,oh fun a naïve idealist let me guess are you also a marxist
nottheonion,removed,what were the lies from that press conference the media retracted it huh noooo the dude that spread the lies went around covering his tracks by tweets for making the media look even more like a dumbass with false information as usual whats hilarious is every dipshit on twitter is saying the inauguration didnt have as many people there well we know that was a lie of course spread by fake news now we know that the numbers were very good and trump comes out and tweets in typical fashion to piss you off saying the numbers were good and the media once again lied and the typical idiot like yourself responds with so fu get to work yadda yadda yadd it was so important to point out that he didnt have a good attendance and when real news broke with real up to date pics there responses where just like that of a year old its truly remarkable the amount of unemployed people that most likely didnt vote for either candidate spend all day just looking to say the dumbest shit to his tweets
nottheonion,removed,more people should call you out on your bullshit lies once again why the fuck did you say it was the worst voter turn out in years when it was over the last election youre a liar simple as that
nottheonion,removed,see mlk for an example of being shut quite literally shot down for looking for radical change free speech means nothing when the only speech that isnt stomped on is speech that doesnt threaten the government in any meaningful way besides nazis dont give a shit about your free speech if they had their way i would be killed being trans and i am not going to let someone run around talking about how we need an ethnic cleansing no matter how much liberals handwring about free speech
nottheonion,removed,spicazos stretched out shit chute
nottheonion,removed,he names them your nan and burns her dole money in front of it
nottheonion,removed,whats funny is you work at a slaughter house and have to come up with ways to make your job for sociopathic dullards more enjoyable
nottheonion,removed,the emperor has no clothes
nottheonion,removed,d
nottheonion,removed,fuck off dude he goes hunting hes not shooting caged birds for the giggles its no worse than buying chicken at the store
nottheonion,removed,yeah cnn is super biased but were not talking about hillary were talking about trump fox news is also incredibly bieased and they reported his approval rating as still think its just the liberal media out to get trump
nottheonion,removed,usually people tend to lie about a few years did you mean and
nottheonion,removed,did you not realize their immaturity were you looking for someone immature and easy to manipulate hold up there how are you gauging this persons level of maturity are you suggesting that you can lump all minors together as predictably empirically and detectably immature in both physical and mental faculties by anyone over the age of consent this reads like the same facile logic that brought about statutory rape laws ive met who are more mature than these people arent mythical unicorns the presumption of universal immaturity among minors is a laughable fallacy
nottheonion,removed,uh yeaim an old fart and i know people in their who act and think like a yr old impulsive behavior lack of selfcontrol poor judgementetc the spectrum of human intelligence is pretty damn broad if were going to be honest with ourselves most people either have kids or are kids and it becomes a personal nightmare when we think about anything bad happening to them and when blinded by emotion and vengeance the sober judgment of the law sounds absurdist
nottheonion,removed,the answer to all of those questions might be no it was a genuine accident but they are still questions worth asking and those are the sort of questions that will be explored during a trial ideally people seem to forget that our justice system isnt one size fits all and that the trial process is designed to take circumstances into consideration in both phases the jury can nullify if they dont feel a crime was committed the judge can adjust sentencing to compensate for mitigating factors like poor judgement vs malice etc this has all kinds of downsides too dont get me wrong—it leads to preferential treatment and racial bias among other things but its not like there arent some good and sane reasons behind why it was set up that way and thats why reforms are so difficult
nottheonion,removed,the purpose of a trial is to determine guilt yes however the purpose of sentencing is complex—and it centers around how determining the appropriate severity of the punishment given the crime and mitigating factors remorse history nature of the act etc and rehabilitation can be one of the goals of a sentence courtordered counselling is usually not the sentence itself but a condition of a sentence so itll be something like being sentenced to probation and one of the conditions of that probation is to seek treatment if you do that goes to show that youre remorseful and the probation was appropriate if you fail to do so then youll end up in jail instead the rehabilitation becomes punishment
nottheonion,removed,the problem with child pornography is the promotion of molestation that was recorded it isnt the viewing in and of itself that is necessarily horrible remember the kids in those videos had to be molestedraped and videorecorded for it to even exist and i doubt any grown person that was subjected to that would allow their image to be sold for the benefit of the people who get off on it
nottheonion,removed,he did indeed molest a kid he pled guilty to doing so at least once as for pedophilia as a paraphilia and not as an acted on urge yeah i feel very sorry for people like that right up until they do act on it i had a great uncle who may or may not have been a pedophile he was very uncomfortable with children and refused to be alone with us that much is for sure he was a very tormented soul as for child porn my feelings are that by using it they are contributing to the problem because kids are being abused to create it even without molesting a single child they are causing it to happen by creating a market for it on the other hand simulated child porn digitally making actors more youthful with editing animated or computer generated features etc that i feel shouldnt carry any sort of legalities it isnt hurting anyone to create and if it helps people resist urges that must not be quenched then its a good thing just like simulated snuff
nottheonion,removed,so tricky though because until you experience it for yourself you just think adults are picking on you its really hard to express you are rational intelligent people but there is still more growth to get through without sounding like youre saying teens are dumb dont listen to them
nottheonion,removed,or ya know its a political tool used to get elected a can be the adult vicitmizing themselves as a child with naked selfies mature enough to seduce themselves and deserve a felony in some states a can boink a but a gets years in prison id like to here the rationale for that law
nottheonion,removed,its time to crunch some numbers
nottheonion,removed,wrong the to men on grindr behave the same as and years olds this thread is full of sexually inexperienced adults thinking that everyone is like them mature enough to go to war get a credit card and vote but sex oh no save the babies
nottheonion,removed,maybe you have some weird infantilization issues with women but men are pretty much the same from to ask any gay man in their and to men want older men they dont want each other or maybe america sees womens value only as sex objects with no agency i wonder why other world nations dont seem to be so puritanical
nottheonion,removed,how can you not know if youre in it make an educated guess
nottheonion,removed,when did he say that hes american
nottheonion,removed,but the thing is that the difference between an year old adult and a year old teen is pretty much nonexistent it doesnt really make a difference in cases like these all the circumstances must be taken into account
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,i dont have a problem with baptists i just dont think theyre held under water for quite long enough
nottheonion,removed,the people who watch the porn to suppress those desires rather than go out and molest kids are not guilty of it i know that watching normal porn totally removes my desire to have sex with consenting adults thats a thing that happens pedophilia isnt illegal possession or trafficking in child pornography is illegal child molestation is illegal pedophilia itself is not
nottheonion,removed,noooo not wolf dick too
nottheonion,removed,also for those who dont have huge staches
nottheonion,removed,jesus thats completely legal in my neck of the woods
nottheonion,removed,religion is stupid
nottheonion,removed,so the big story is some christians are having trouble deciding something mkay thats terrible the big story with muslims well it was orlando now its turkey if i had to choose a side id choose the side who isnt shooting up and bombing people all over the planet every week sorry for my racist hateful oh we why dont dont the peaceful muslims stop the problem they all ran and flooded into other countries and its coincidental that muslim attacks are on the rise where they landed
nottheonion,removed,valid question on counts firstly is islam a religion or is it a fascist movement utilizing religiosity secondly is religious freedom a meaningful concept if for example the church of religious intolerance declares itself a religion is tolerating a religion that practices religious intolerance as a core article of faith religious tolerance or is that just surrender and indirect intolerance of every religion except that one
nottheonion,removed,ask the muslims what they think of religious freedom
nottheonion,removed,common sense tolerating islam has bad lifethreatening consequences for everyone so we can all agree that it should not be tolerated simple as that
nottheonion,removed,not oniony and downvoted sorry probably falun gong
nottheonion,removed,well to be fair jehovahs witnesses and mormons are both cults
nottheonion,removed,i wish they were more like a cult and just killed themselves
nottheonion,removed,nah he just wants a good excuse to beat up his woman
nottheonion,removed,i noticed most of the comments point out the issues with christianity for which there are many so please dont forget the issues with islam islam is more than a religion it is a totalitarian theocracy that is mysoginistic homophobic and mandates that its believers convert conquer or kill nonmuslims see httpthereligionofpeacecom
nottheonion,removed,to be fair conservative christians grapple with many things that involve thinking
nottheonion,removed,personally i dont see how technology plays a role in the conversation google people can research things now that they never could before for example you can go on google and find out that homosexuality doesnt make you an evil person losing your virginity before marriage doesnt make you an evil person a fetus is not actually a baby with a functioning brain therefore having an abortion before the brain is developed does not mean youre an evil person who is committing murder we also know that evolution is real because there is verifiable proof so believing in it doesnt make you an evil person and so on these things apparently directly conflict with the teachings of the bible christians will tell you that if you dont renounce homosexuality jesus cant save you and you wont go to heaven thanks to technology we are now smarter than ever and can realize that this is all malarky invented to guilt people into keeping strict morals religion is a tool used by the upper class to keep the lower class subservient and docile if you look at someone like henry viii he wanted to get a divorce which is a biblical nono so he just went and invented his own religion after he died his daughter mary decided everyone needed to go back to the old catholocism and literally burned anyone who questioned her they committed adultery and murder in the name of religion because they were at the top everyone else had to change their beliefs in order to survive im an atheist i dont need to pay for someone like joel osteen and fly on a private jet in order to be a good person also didnt jesus say that its easier for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven regardless of all that i manage to have morals without also having tons of guilt or being pinned down under the belief that if i make any kind of mistake then i will burn for eternity in imaginary fire pits thanks technology
nottheonion,removed,nice
nottheonion,removed,rule no satire articles is this a violation
nottheonion,removed,weve been in a police state since the police went from being a private security force to a collective school become a good capitalist you are in trouble if you dont go to school and the police will pick you up for truancy you are taught to watch a clock and obey the masters being rewarded for doing what they want and knowing what they want you to know this includes when you say brownies and it might remotely be considered racist silly but this is what sjw and selfentitled millennial pricks want we are now listening to the testimony of a grader to determine that police action is necessary how innocuous the word was is not the issue at all the fact was that someone communicated something and someone received the communication and took it a certain way rather than discussion about how what was said was perceived as hurtful and so maybe it shouldnt be said and how what was said wasnt racist at all its the name of a food and how maybe the manner or context it was said led one to believe it to be true or not for all we know the kid said it in a mocking manner calling the other kid nigger with a safe word cop out of brownie just like people saying nword are assholes for making me think the word you mean thats how communication works assholes that does not mean police ought to be involved at all but they are for the reasons detailed above put the fear of authority into kids to neuter them and let corporations continue their rule
nottheonion,removed,of course the potential kid toucher was a stem major
nottheonion,removed,also that cat looks so damn smug
nottheonion,removed,meanwhile the social studies teacher year old mrs pritchett is having a train run on her by year olds and nobody seems to mind
nottheonion,removed,so you began grade at years old uh huh
nottheonion,removed,thats the normal age for a grader man
nottheonion,removed,so he didnt bang a student or get baked he was just talking
nottheonion,removed,wait he just said brownies the article i read yesterday made it seem like he called the brownies something racist but never mentioned what he actually said i thought he asked for fucking coon squares or something
nottheonion,removed,your math doesnt add up you must have failed a grade because if you turned in sixth grade then you would have turned in ninth grade not so the age at which you graduated is irrelevant to the age at which you entered school anyway so maybe dont be a jerk boy
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,why exactly is this story on rnottheonion
nottheonion,removed,you could not have turned in sixth grade and also turned in ninth grade you must have been held back or you must have changed schools to alter your school schedule most likely you failed math
nottheonion,removed,sounds like a region run by dumb cunts and over reacting sjws
nottheonion,removed,yes because a few videos on the youtubes is an accurate representation of the us population
nottheonion,removed,im reserving judgement until i see more i think you vastly underestimate kids around was probably the most crass and horrible ive been in my entire life not to mention that empathy is part of what isnt fully developed
nottheonion,removed,dictatorproblems
nottheonion,removed,not exactly oniony its already started
nottheonion,removed,is it not absurdly obvious
nottheonion,removed,my point is not that racial disparity does not exist because it does rather im pointing out that it has nothing to do with spraying axe in your mouth not sure what is so hard to understand about that
nottheonion,removed,thank god i voted for trump so i can just legally shoot you from my auto while you try not to flip in a panic
nottheonion,removed,imagine things like driverless taxis going to chimpout central in detroit or such they will destroy them
nottheonion,removed,i think you are either a trolling right now b maybe and just malicious stupidity or c trolling driverless cars do not equal autonomous vehicles controlled by an invisible group even a second skim over google on the subject would show you this you must by default be trolling as its very rare to find someone who would actually be this stupid even on reddit
nottheonion,removed,thats why states have signs that say left lane is for passing only and cops even tell you to match the flow of traffic no wonder people fuck with you
nottheonion,removed,no youre the only person talking about that because youre obviously either really stupid or trolling everyone else is trying to point out to you that driverless cars do not equal transport is autonomous and human driving is banned and you have surrendered your right to movement like you claim they do the fact that youre trying to shift the goalposts and construct a man argument at the same time in such an obvious telegraphed manner suggests you arnt even as clever as you think you are and should just stop trolling now
nottheonion,removed,not the same downshifting will slow down your car a lot quicker than just letting off the gas
nottheonion,removed,you say that as though google doesnt do that already
nottheonion,removed,dude its always those cunts who drive those trucks and youre wrong theyre not going to a hoedown theyre just going to fuck their sister
nottheonion,removed,hey jerkoff every wonder why people get road rage because of pricks like you who intentionally piss people off for no reason you couldve slowed on the single lane to let him by easier or let him pass at the twolane but your little dick got the best of you try that with the wrong person and youll wind up in the ditch beat down in the street or shot you are a prick worse than the tailgater by far rolling road blocks are also illegal in some states keep gamblingyoull wind up on the news one day in a bad way

nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,hahaha this is funny as a human i find the demise of my species impending and funny i relate to this dissonance
nottheonion,removed,how so thats the most valuable lesson you can learn as a new driver everyone else is a retarded asshole who will try to cause an accident and then blame you the sooner you accept that the quicker you learn how to drive defensively driving is only maybe about driving the other is dealing with the other drivers

nottheonion,removed,the entire fried chicken and watermelon thing started because its food you eat with your hands and thus was seen as dirty food for lesser people actually watermelon is an african fruit
nottheonion,removed,people are already incapable of doing certain things if the government believes it would be a danger to others to exercise particular righttradedecision without a qualification cant vote without being cant do surgery without being a doctor cant teach without being a licensed teacher cant work if not given a permit to do so cant be a president if a dual citizen cant drive without a license cant pull the plug if not a family member cant provide legal advice if not a lawyer and even then there are restrictions of when cant sell food that doesnt pass certain standards theres many others and while i dont have an alternative it is not absurd to recommend further education before taking a decision would you be ok receiving surgery from a random stranger just because he believes he has your best interests at hand doesnt matter if he knows what hes doing

nottheonion,removed,that is an obviously biased source and the very first point implies causation between two trends with no proof between and the foreignborn share of the us population grew from percent to percent and the number of unauthorized immigrants more than tripled from million to million during the same period fbi data indicate that the violent crime rate declined percent—which included falling rates of aggravated assault robbery rape and murder likewise the property crime rate fell percent including declining rates of motor vehicle theft larcenyrobbery and burglary
nottheonion,removed,its crazy if trump were elected he might do something irresponsible like destabilize a country for no reason and allow isis to take control of it during the ensuing chaos hey kind of what hillary did in libya
nottheonion,removed,you mean the idea that america was founded on and wisely moved away from jesus i cant believe someone thinks creating second class citizens is a good idea once you start deciding who gets a vote and who doesnt then democracy becomes a sham it becomes voters enriching themselves at the expense of the nonvoters not only that once youve accepted the idea that some people cant vote it becomes much easier to add more people to that list imagine all the black people suddenly denied votes because they are poor and dont own land congratulations you just rolled back significant civil rights

nottheonion,removed,im sorry for calling you willfully ignorant because youre obviously just fucking ignorant the things you cited union dues pension taxes arent at all unique to police officers complaining about having a pension and benefits those things dont just fund themselves is one i havent heard before if your response is indicative of the mindset of an average police officer in canada since you know oh so many maybe we should try to attract more intelligent people to the force
nottheonion,removed,it is not hard to clear every weapon and also make sure you are only using dummy or blank rounds when doing these drills what if you use httpsenwikipediaorgwikibrandonleedeath its heartbreaking that people just dont learn as much as the instructor and planner of this exercise are also responsible for creating an unsafe situation with the illusion of safety this is ultimately the firearm users responsibility this is a fundamental failure to respect some of the most important rule of firearm safety both from the firearm operator and the instructors treat firearms as if they are loaded theres really no need to even use blanks in a role play exercise like this even if you do deem it necessary to use blanks which by the way complicates the scenario as everyone is now required to wear hearing protection you dont point directly at the target you fire past them in fact this exercise doesnt even require the presence of a real firearm at all better to use an orange plastic toy or prop with just an audible trigger action in it because a firearm is always loaded especially when it isnt and thats why you should never point a firearm at anything you dont want to destroy because if you do happen to have the muzzle pointing at a nontarget and you happen to squeeze the trigger and the firearm happens to be loaded which it always is youll destroy the nontarget you dont want to do that dont point muzzles at anything you dont want to destroy other failures possibly never leave your firearm unattended unless you unload it first how did the mixup with the ammo happen were they supposed to use dummy rounds which can be difficult to tell apart from live rounds or blanks how did live ammo get onto the exercise the real questions are though why did they use real firearms in the exercise why didnt they clear and secure all guns that entered the training area why did they think pointing a real firearm at a person and mockfiring directly at them was a good idea in the first place regardless of what kind of safe rounds were supposed to be used what went through the participants minds when they were essentially told to ignore the basics of firearm safety why did they go through it i get that its difficult to say no to someone seemingly in charge but fuck this is basically just like the incomprehensibly moronic do you trust me game that the marines play this whole news really rustled my jimmies more so than it really should have i guess if youre dealing with firearms be safe they dont kill anyone by themselves but theyre designed to kill and if you misuse them they can be fatal to the user or anyone around sorry this turned into a semirant i dont know about others but firearm safety really is a topic thats somewhat important to me and i dont even own a firearm had a sort of disturbing experience in my childhood that really made me question the assumption that adults and people in charge actually know what theyre doing and some other things

nottheonion,removed,not one mention of muslims in the comments it was muslims
nottheonion,removed,arabs living on the french state and studying koran for a living love to torch cars the ethnic french are not doing this its the north african religious loons
nottheonion,removed,read the damn french news for the last decade and learn you are the damn racist north african is not a fucking race also it is north african youth they are mostly muslims who basically will not work there are about news stories in english and a million in french there are no words for you inflamatory racists i have no insult deep enough you are the problem
nottheonion,removed,you are unwilling to grasp the information written in the article that it was north africans it was north africans in sweden as well you can play make believe all you want my sympathy levels are getting lower and lower for these european countries because of you people who live in lala land hundreds of women were assaulted last year hundreds have been killed in europe since by terrorism in the past two years there was a terrorist attack every week only a few months ago of the crime in sweden is by of the population and you people just sit by anti rape shorts are sold out in germany you found one article about fucking insurance fraud and pretend that the problem is solved god speed france god speed

nottheonion,removed,muslims
nottheonion,removed,muslims
nottheonion,removed,thats the difference between having hundreds of thousands of north africans in your society or not
nottheonion,removed,very few north africans in canada
nottheonion,removed,these acts are being carried out by immigrant north africans not by the native french however it is all being done in poor communities not in middle class or rich areas so the french are not really motivated into action allowing so many people from the third world into the country is a total disaster you could argue you are relieving people from poverty but to do what to live in slums and commit crimes better to spend the money on integrating these people on investing in their home countries directly
nottheonion,removed,import brown people and then act surprised when they ruin your city
nottheonion,removed,so those are these western or european values everyone is talking about
nottheonion,removed,the different between canadausa and europe is that we force our immigrants to integrate and dont promise them that theyll get free food housing cash stipends and a job off the job tree north africans and people from other decidedly not wartorn countries go to europe because they fall for rumors that they can easily have a better life there then they get angry when they get here and end up sitting around on their asses for months and years and still dont have a steady job or a nice place to live
nottheonion,removed,id love to just openly ask if it was those new europeans but i dont know if it will get banned im sure it is though
nottheonion,removed,tradition my ass it is mainly youths belonging to a middle eastern certain religion acting out their racism and hatred against the french people our msm the paid media including reddit will do anything to censor this shit

nottheonion,removed,look at how many times hes posted the exact same comment in one single thread its pathetic
nottheonion,removed,french french love to burn cars yes
nottheonion,removed,and i bet none of it was done by french people
nottheonion,removed,its very interesting how all comments mentioning that this is done by muslims has been removed reddit is a disgusting piece of shit sharia compliant islamist supporting shithole muslims are the ones burning cars in france muslims
nottheonion,removed,more of a law and order lover
nottheonion,removed,in this very thread any comment explaining that it is muslims doing this has been deleted
nottheonion,removed,what the fuck is wrong with you
nottheonion,removed,not really though theyll just raise insurance rates on everyone to compensate
nottheonion,removed,france imported some population that likes torching cars it wasnt a local tradition
nottheonion,removed,i see some say this has gone on for decades maybe with native french but i believe the made it tradition for the new french frances state of emergencies really are worthless
nottheonion,removed,because unruly baboons have been let loose in europe
nottheonion,removed,you can thank the tanned french diaspora for that dont worry it will end up in war sooner or later well get rid of the invaders
nottheonion,removed,degenerates
nottheonion,removed,hey bunnicusrex i hold the opinion that you are a lowquality individual i wager that people which you respect and cherish find you in turn to be distasteful furthermore evidence points to the conclusion that you are undeserving of your personal achievements all of which you likely attained fraudulently i look forward to chortling derisively at any response you are able to produce as i fully anticipate it will be certifiably banal and hilariously benign good day to younot
nottheonion,removed,then they shouldnt be locked up at all in my opinion
nottheonion,removed,funny how they dont mention that it was muslims as usual just like its muslims that torch cars en masse in other european countries too
nottheonion,removed,they arent immigrants generally theyre third gen north africans dont be pedantic he said theyre not native french and it holds true whether theyre immigrants or the sonsdaughters of immigrants theyre certainly not french and its not so much allowing people from the third world in its letting them in and then basically keeping them from being able to work and trying to use the welfare state to keep them pacified no one is keeping them out of work theyre often very lazy people and come from deeply corrupt nations with almost zero work ethic not to mention that the french have massive unemployment for themselves where are these extra jobs you want them to throw at immigrants the fact is europe needs to shut its doors this social experiment has gone on far too long and has revealed itself to be a total disaster in the us illegal immigrants have higher employment rates and lower rates of crime than natives and this effect persists over several generations in the us though we dont price them out of the labor market via boneheaded laws at least not yet this is a complete lie the study youre referring to which has been soundly debunked did not measure illegal crime against that of all americans but rather against that of similarly stationed americans aka blacks and hispanics in other words illegals do not commit less crime than natives they commit slightly less crime than our most criminal populations thats hardly something to brag about beyond that hispanics use welfare at about the white rate and commit far more crime so suggesting that weve made diversity work in america and theyve failed in europe is nonsense no one has made it work because it doesnt
nottheonion,removed,this is what happens when you let nonwhites flood your country
nottheonion,removed,such diversity such enrichment
nottheonion,removed,calling them not french at all is the most disingenuous racist crap i can read on here tbh african americans are still fucking american despite being from elsewhere originally these are people who have been in the country for years and usually generations id hardly call them not french its a problem the french dont want to own up to and very much a problem of their own creation before they blame any of it on the new migrant wave that doesnt really involve their sad excuses for colonies excuse my patriotism but theyve failed their colonies so dramatically that the commonwealth really lives up to the name theyve all had years to come up through french educations french society and media france saw the falling apart of empires and failed to integrate their communities the long and short of it is the government had no plan failed dramatically and now everyone ignores it there is often self imposed segregation due to a lack of willingness and top down mandated integration id argue in reference to my first post that yeah this is a continuation of their same old cultural ideals unless i know you already fuck right off but hey they have a literal second class of citizens in france so thats great if youre real french in all seriousness they need to sort it out the same way the us has needed to sort it out for generations but theyve never really had the impetus to do so and they probably wont ghettoisation is terrible imo frankly theres too much of the self imposed segregation in the uk for my liking it creates enclaves and its dangerous but politicians are not the scholars they pretend to be i will say this there are many french people aware of the situation and what could be done to change things im not trying to tar all french people with the same brush but there simply are cultural attitudes in some countries that need changing the same is certainly the case in britain too
nottheonion,removed,thanks islam d
nottheonion,removed,oh its mostly middle eastern thrash that refugees brought with them
nottheonion,removed,frances minority population in total is still less than a quarter of what americas is they are black america is they have less than asian or latino we have latino and like asian there is actually a direct correlation between crime and diversity to ignore it is non factual we dont know what the cause is but to pretend this has always been the case is foolish france has much more crime than norway norway is less diverse same with switzerland you will find all the high crime nations in europe have the most immigration
nottheonion,removed,they probably also downplayed that this was the work of radical islamists close the borders
nottheonion,removed,muslims in france torch a lot of cars its a by product of all thier peacefulness
nottheonion,removed,sorry the french government allows these violent people to enter your country
nottheonion,removed,france is devolving into a third world shithole what else is new
nottheonion,removed,next they will start torching women

nottheonion,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
nottheonion,removed,niggers commit way too much crime i cannot trust black people to not end up being niggers because the majority of black people are niggers the good black people are too few and far between if white people committed as much crime as niggers then i would treat whites like white trash instead of white people if you take all of the niggers and spics out of us crime statistics then we have a lower crime rate than canada and europe the southerners fucked us by being too lazy to pick their own cotton if you hate niggers then blame those fucking rednecks waving the confederate flag

nottheonion,removed,heres an idea automatically dismiss anyone who says the word establishment because it is a vague nonsensical term that doesnt even describe anyone in particular you can literally replace the word with politicians whove won in elections before
nottheonion,removed,shit title on behalf of global news and you shouldnt have propagated it just because global posted a clickbait title read the facts she was not kicked off the plane because she was heavy she hadnt even boarded yet the airline had made an intentional mistake in bookings to ensure a full flight but shit happens when you overbook so they pay for it from what i can see they offered fair compensation for delaying the travel of the couple even over what is required of them by regulations the fact that she was pregnant is a nonissue made to look like that was the reason just to get more eyes on the story that aircraft could easily take off and fly safely with every seat full including one seat with a pregnant woman in it a dozen fat men could be in every seat and adjusting for cargo that plane will still fly perfectly safely so this is a crock of shit
nottheonion,removed,which was enough to turn the tide in several swing states that we could have won otherwise evidence please

nottheonion,removed,its literally not in the tweet youre either a troll or a moron i can only really imagine a troll
nottheonion,removed,lesbianism is caused by a physiological abnormality its harmless and only effects an individuals preferences toward romantic attraction that being said its still a physiological abnormality and in that respect a medical condition the plaintiffs outrage lends credit to the idea that more effort should be put in to studying other more psychological symptoms of the stated condition this makes listing it as a medical condition even more credible her argument is counterproductive at best
nottheonion,removed,oh my god where did he say being registered in two states is illegal or that those who are have committed a crime quote it please i voted for hillary you fool youre the one changing his words

nottheonion,removed,is this rpolitics stop with the liberal crap just about everyone that has moved is registered in two states
nottheonion,removed,i dont know one single enthusiastic icp fan who isnt a raging dumpster fire of a human being i cant even imagine what their platform would be since they seem to enjoy making rape victims cry and not understanding science i think theyre probably going to have a pro trump rally
nottheonion,removed,loosely organized hybrid gang is probably a really accurate description for fucking juggalos i had a friend who got beat to death by a juggalo gang a few years ago
nottheonion,removed,how many juggalos live within a hundred feet of the place where its happening because thats about as far as those useless fucks will walk
nottheonion,removed,yes uerktheerk it did happen
nottheonion,removed,i cant blame people at all for having some healthy skepticism because it sounds absolutely ridiculous i didnt believe it when i heard it ive seen interviews and posts by some of the other people that were there and a bunch of other juggalos just sat and watched while it happened
nottheonion,removed,on the contrary theres plenty of groups that a person can belong to and it automatically signals to the rest of us that they are raging douchebags
nottheonion,removed,unnaturally
nottheonion,removed,right wing clown squads
nottheonion,removed,how can you lose when you have winners like watching your back
nottheonion,removed,oh boy dont even get me started on that pointless organization
nottheonion,removed,rpolitics
nottheonion,removed,repost
nottheonion,removed,except for when icp made that rape victim cry that was a little less than great feminism leftleaning or preaching of love and acceptance or have you found a way to rationalize that
nottheonion,removed,just curious as a feminist juggalo how do you justify them making the rape victim cry
nottheonion,removed,cracked is garbage and progressivist propaganda read their stupid feminist articles
nottheonion,removed,you know itsounds bad when juggaloes start marching against you
nottheonion,removed,woo woo lol nah i think face paint is for dorks and homos but i can appreciate their message as easy as it may be to ridicule it and im offended by the lack of creativity not your regurgitation of played out banal horseshit
nottheonion,removed,im doing no such thing im not suggesting any unfair treatment im not suggesting any action at all if anything the most correct knowledge can lead to people having the easiest time dealing with these issues but assuming im some sort of bigot against the lgbt community based on some facts ive shared is actually closer to the definition of bigotry
nottheonion,removed,you got misunderstand this kind of app is just like a funny thing parents never take apart in this it likes a selfmocking joke actually if parents know their future daughterinlaw is fake they will reacted with furyз」∠

nottheonion,removed,how has missouri built up the reputation of being racist
nottheonion,removed,xenophobia is the word youre looking for and its different than racism you couldnt dumb your comment down any more i promise
nottheonion,removed,i never said anything even remotely suggesting that have you taken your medicine today
nottheonion,removed,are you saying that muslims in the us are incapable of sorting things out themselves thats disgustingly racist
nottheonion,removed,seems the democrats have registered more of them to their rolls
nottheonion,removed,no youre the racist buddy check your privilege
nottheonion,removed,not sure what to say except that we have had different experiences when i lived in missouri i mainly saw the areas of missouri that is considered more progressive while that does not seem to be the case for you some of my older relatives have some old fashioned views
nottheonion,removed,hey dont jihad anybody over this okay

nottheonion,removed,but i thought that isis werent muslims this just proves they are
nottheonion,removed,yeah because there were so many reports of people using that archaic law that at the time made sense as they were trying to overthrow local government the beginnings of the mormon religion was like scientology meets isislite following an easily debunked wackjob killing and stealing because they were the chosen people the only sad thing about joseph smith getting killed was that brigham young wasnt killed with him google the mountain meadows massacre the last religious group ill pity are the lds
nottheonion,removed,really its a joke if this concerns you you are stupid
nottheonion,removed,propaganda of hate defended by a moron
nottheonion,removed,wow talk about misleading as fuck title their bumper stickers and if the muslims arent members of isis why should they care its not a statement against muslims but against terrorism
nottheonion,removed,its not a joke but a campaign sticker and honestly you cant see how this could possibly go wrong in the least its encouraging more muslim hate which we are at critical mass for already
nottheonion,removed,if you arent a part of isis you have nothing to worry about
nottheonion,removed,well its only getting scarier thats for sure but the price of your head goes down considerably after you are in office it looks like bush is having the time of his life waaay less stressed cant wait to see obama after years of not being pres oh and fuck drumph

nottheonion,removed,but they lost didnt they anyone can sue anyone for anything its the results that matter
nottheonion,removed,you might want to have that basic english deficiency looked at it could be a symptom of something genetic
nottheonion,removed,parents who do these things subconsciously believe one of two things that reading these books messed themselves up when they were children this is a less preferable option because it explicitly implies that they are messed up and nobody wants to think that that their children are weaker than they are this is the major reason parenting has changed so rapidly in the last generation despite it not having changed much in the years prior to that these two options are the reason kids cant ride bikes around the neighbourhood or climb trees or have peanut butter because they have parents who were raised by tv deciding that actually being a child is too dangerous for children
nottheonion,removed,no i wouldnt put it past dipshit sjws to either not have read the book or not understand it they are stupid

nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,what adult exists that cant get out of the ghetto also what prevents them outside of consequences to their own actions well first of all million people live below the poverty line thats almost of the population of the usa for a single person the poverty line is at about for a family of four so when you say what adult exists that cant escape poverty youre asking a loaded question since we are unable to define what makes one capable of escaping poverty ill give you an analogy to escape the lower of basketball players lets assume you need to be able to shoot two free throws in a row let me ask you this what capable person exists that is incapable of shooting two free throws in a row none every human with two arms and minimal strength is capable of such a feat but what percentage of the population will escape basketball poverty if you give every single american the opportunity to attempt two free throws in a row not all of them no matter how you look at it you are going to be left with a group of people who got shafted got unlucky made mistakes or just couldnt do it this is poverty where the basketball analogy fails is the vicious cycle of poverty where simply by being poor you face harsher expenses in your daily life heres an example you live in a family of four your household income is per year because mom and dad both have shitty part time jobs why ill discuss that in a second mom and dad share a toyota camry that they bought used in cash for one day the car breaks now simply because they were never in a position where they were able to finance a more reliable car they are going to face unexpected expenses such as their car breaking down now they have to spend replacing broken car part if they dont fix the car they lose their jobs if they lose their jobs they lose more than they have no choice this is just one example which you can apply to anything washing machines hospital expenses literally anything by virtue of being poor you are forced to buy lower quality products by virtue of being low quality these products will need to be replaced more often you would buy high quality products but you cant afford them because you have no savings why by virtue of being poor now youve asked what prevents them from escaping poverty the answer is partially poverty in itself being a vicious cycle but also why they are in poverty most people in poverty were born from parents who were also in poverty blacks have the highest rate of poverty at about would you like to know why well some time ago america as a whole did not like people of color a wealthy man of color would have a very difficult time moving into a white neighborhood of the same wealth a man of color would have a hard time finding a job if he were competing against white men with the same resume come on be real picture a white employer in looking at two identical resumes white dave and black dave youre ignorant if you think black dave gets the job a man of color would have a hard time completing an education because of all the factors ive been discussing thus far since black people were commonly poor and disliked they wound up in the same towns and neighborhoods together which you would expect since these are the towns and neighborhoods with the lowest cost of living you wouldnt see an affluent white family move into a poor black neighborhood just the same as you wouldnt see the opposite essentially black poverty exists today at higher rates than other races as a direct result of black oppression from the we shoved them all into shitty communities were unable to create enough jobs for them and generally didnt provide them nearly enough governmental aid as they need so heres my challenge to you abandon your life here take to detroit and try to get out of the ghetto in one year yeah its real easy when youre just chatting on the internet its different when you literally dont have enough money to survive let alone thrive however you have one strong point but moving out of a shitty neighborhood can take a year of hard work and dedication this is true this is why gangs are more prevalent in lower class communities when you have no way of finding legal income you either starve or become a criminal and its no secret that criminal industries are very wealthy crime absolutely pays until you get caught ive seen some interesting papersdocumentaries attempting to prove that the whites in power actually manufactured racedriven poverty by pushing drugs into urban communities knowing that it would create criminals ive seen similar research attempting to prove that the nixon administration did this same thing to eliminate the black vote i dont know how much i believe these theories but i definitely find them intriguing anyways you lack an understanding of what it really means to be in poverty to you it seems that poverty means you are poor and have to work a little harder in life thats not the case not one bit according to statistics if youre born poor you stay poor unless you bust ass day and night and catch a lucky break welcome to america

nottheonion,removed,alright show me where an innocent person was murdered by a police officer fucking last wednesday mate google first degree murder police literally returns hundreds of completely separate cases dating back decades really theres no over militarization of our police force you understand the difference between a military in a warzone breaking down your door and looking for contraband and a swat team in military gear doing a noknock warrant looking for a previous tenant smashing your door in the middle of the night and holding you at gun point there is no difference that second situation is almost completely unique to the usa america is a police state and has been for a while could it be that police officers get gunned down when they pull over the wrong car by the numbers it is safer to be a police officer in the usa than it is to be a citizen in the usa half the police deaths in the line of duty in died in an accident or sniped or ran over or filled with lead for doing their job or werent wearing their seatbelt because more officers died from that than those other things you mentioned combined just because youre needlessly afraid of somebody doing their job doesnt mean copkillers are police killed more civilians than civilians killed police it makes more sense to be afraid of the police than any other profession youre more likely to be accidentally killed by the police than caught in a terrorist attack also cop killer isnt a profession ive never even heard of a criminal who wasnt afraid of the police theres no money in it the punishment is what you get for a regular person it creates enough heat to drown out any business youre trying to do drug dealing it just doesnt make sense in fact the police have gone on record to say many criminal organizations have a nokill policy towards police hells angels ny mafia etc yeah maybe im just a fool yuuuuup who likes to believe we have law enforcement for a reason nope strawman detected nobody thinks we could do without law enforcement nobody get it in your head repeat it criticizing the police and saying we could do without are completely different i can say it make sense to be afraid of the police and still agree they are fundamental

nottheonion,removed,ok first off you are ignoring half of my arguments you can not decide from one video clip and an article these peoples mental states nor can you correctly judge the full situation of these peoples struggles needs or thoughts you are not a mind reader second i was obviously putting you in the situation and talking from your point of view if you were in this situation i never said you would could should do any of these things that happened or that you ever would want to think about or do these actions i was obviously giving examples where you would play this in your mind and think about it with more humility third you replied to me that normal people cant have this situation arise it can happen it did happen people make dumber mistakes everyday i could give you examples of this happening but that is too much for you mind to handle because every point i bring up you ignore or glance over as would never happen because you think it shouldnt i dont know how old you are but you posting in kingdom hearts and digimon is very interesting to say the least you immature out look on this situation says to me that you dont understand that worse then this happens everyday it shouldnt you are right but it does people are sold into slavery people kill others over drugs and religion there is people die each day there is million people die each year there is millions of unsolved cases of murder people die in car crashes people die because of a lot more then abusive but more then that people also survive horrible situations too stronger people then you or me raise above their abuse handicap or whatever else is terrible in their life that kid has a lot more then just abuse to kill himself instantly it is both nature and nurture that means that his parents and his poor mental state are both at fault not just one but both it is like talking to a brick wall ether you are a troll or naive to think that this doesnt happen daily fuck that fuck that fuck that fuck that fuck that fuck that fuck that that is some of the dumbest shit that has ever been said normal parenting will never lead to your kid immediately killing themselves and fuck anyone who thinks that that kind of treatment is anywhere near acceptable this happens every damn day and it is worse some times people are sold into slavery people are killed over rocksdiamonds people are tortured and killed everyday and i am sure we dont hear about all of them one father and one son where you only see a video and read an article about it doesnt make you an expert on abuse or what the son was thinking

nottheonion,removed,no because men by fact are more willing to have sex with strangers more and more likely to have sex with people they think is ugly that and i just said i was hornydesperate stop making false assumptions which i corrected stop bringing up a point that i had already admitted was flawed and corrected people didnt correct their statements they kept using the same flawed comparisons not saying your arguments are invalid im saying your arguments are slanted in your favor due to your demographics if i was in a mostly black forum they would mostly be going against my arguments that try and argue that the problems of police brutality is overexaggerated its not to say their arguments would be invalid but their arguments are slanted due to their demographics you can be biased and still have a valid argument you can be unbiased and not have a valid argument but your bias does influence the motivation and structure of your argument irregardless im not even denying that guy on guy violence isnt bad im not denying that society has a problem with men being expected to silently endure hardship or stress very few people in western society would actually deny that why in oblivion would you think i did i simply said that rape is worse then being beat up thats my opinion thats an opinion shared by a lot of other people yet you seem to be taking offense at that idea well guess what get over it other people have preferences as to what kind of harm they would rather suffer over others you want to know why this entire conversation irritates me because you guys are making dragons out of bandits why do use that analogy over the classic dragons out of mice because men do have problems i myself am a guy and i freaking know this first hand however it seems to be that nowadays guys want this right here if people like you would understand this simple hypocrisy and either acknowledge that women and men arent equal or accept that men have their own issues to deal with that are arguably just as bad as womens issues then wed get somewhere this is exactly my issue you cant possibly accept the fact that women have it worse then men in society why because everybody and their fucking grandmother thinks they are a victim even rich white people who live in mansions complain about how they are attacked in society men have problems yes but women have issues and in many cases they are worse then men the problem with men in society is almost always connected to two things callousness and apathy often time those problems arent done against men but theyre done by men your father and other guys who were the ones who told you to suck it up that judge who was a male was the one who gave your child to your deranged exwife instead of you the issues with women is that often time because of historical precedent of men being given positions of power women suffer problems that are usually caused by men to women or its caused by both gender men and women to other women the only systematic advantage that women have over men in society is in regards to how they are treated in the courts women are looked at more sympathetically than men when it comes to the areas of economics and careers then men are at an advantage over women due to a combination of internal prejudice societal expectations for what career a woman should want and a combination other factors such as a support system in stem based careers do men and women have different issues yes but do men have it as badly as women no i disagree you can say they do and fine more power to you but personally i think nowadays every single demographic in this country believes that just because their demographic is suffering some sort of problem that means theyre suffering just as badly as demographics that traditionally have all the social movements and civil rights support ive seen white people say that whites face just as much discrimination and oppression as blacks rich people talking about how poorly the rich are treated in society its fucking annoying it irritates the crap out of me

nottheonion,removed,ballistic missile testing was not part of the nuke deal see iran never agreed to not test or build them they only agreed on a conditional arms embargo on obtaining them or their parts from others iran wouldnt agree to the deal otherwise and obama decided to not make it a deal breaker the people that keep bringing this up republican congressman mainly are either misinformed or just dont like that its not part of the nuke deal releasing iranian frozen funds was part of the deal the us is violating the deal by not returning all frozen funds frivolous lawsuits the us is also playing fast and loose with the treaty with releasing banking restrictions iran must abide by the terms it agreed to including reducing its stockpile of lowenriched uranium material that can be made into nuclear fuel for weapons by for years reducing the number of centrifuges it has that enrich uranium at its main nuclear processing center in natanz by twothirds to and moving the remaining centrifuges to a monitored storage site iran has also agreed to convert an enrichment site called fordo located deep in a mountainside and immune from air attacks into a research center compliance with these provisions would make iran unable to produce enough nuclear material for a weapon for at least years the regime must also allow for a new inspections regime under which the un nuclear agency can ask to inspect a site it deems suspicious iran has the right to refuse which puts the result in the hands of an independent arbitration panel that decides whether iran must comply with the request within hours in addition iran has agreed to the conditional continuation of the current un arms embargo for up to five more years as well as the continuation of current restrictions on the transfer of certain missile technology for up to eight more years in exchange the country stands to receive the more than billion in overseas assets that have been frozen by other countries it would also see the end of a european oil embargo and other financial restrictions on its banks

nottheonion,removed,not even remotely true you bigoted asshole
nottheonion,removed,theres a problem where these folks cant understand the difference between transgender and transvestite not saying transvestites are dangerous perverts or anything but a transgender person believes they are the gender of the bathroom theyre using a transvestite gets off on dressing the opposite sex which still isnt hurting anyone isnt a problem its time to have empathy for folks and its time to start putting yourself in other folks shoes thank you jmnetwork

nottheonion,removed,which starkly contrasts with the sourcing issue inherent in dont stick your dick in krazy which btw is always best edited to include just let them slobber all over it as theyre actually quite good at that
nottheonion,removed,more like the patriarchy guys just havent been taught to consider a woman as a person instead of an object for their pleasure so goddamn lame

nottheonion,removed,oh my fucking god that was disgusting
nottheonion,removed,this may surprise you but youre not very bright
nottheonion,removed,repost same story as although possibly better title here
nottheonion,removed,yeah actually thought it was a trolling attempt by apple but i was so wrong thought to myself who would buy a digital watch with limited lifespan when you can buy real watches like breitling rolex longines etc
nottheonion,removed,i really hope youre trolling brushed aluminum has been their thing for some time glossy white on the bezel of ipads and phones nowhere else yeah their earpods but no shit
nottheonion,removed,the daily stormer is using troll tactics though their goal in declaring new balance their shoe is to cause outrage and get attention it seems best to ignore them
nottheonion,removed,youre an idiot
nottheonion,removed,how about a spectrum between heterosexual and attack helicopter
nottheonion,removed,they have that too but if users still cant find their preferred option they can also type in the gender title they wish to be identified as
nottheonion,removed,gender autobot really
nottheonion,removed,this is great makes it easier to avoid the delusional crazy people
nottheonion,removed,adam carolla had a good bit about this on one of his podcasts recently essentially said that people will look back at him and judge him for being just a guy hell he wasnt even gender fluid
nottheonion,removed,i would say there is only two genders but we all know that simply isnt true
nottheonion,removed,what the fuck is gender fluid is that like penis water snatch juice
nottheonion,removed,this is really dumb theres no way it is necessary to have trans man transgender man transsexual man transgender male and transsexual male theyre all the same thing
nottheonion,removed,writing in harambe would have signaled disgust admit it you are a lazy fuck who doesnt deserve their vote
nottheonion,removed,in a row
nottheonion,removed,some guys have xx and a y chromosome and dont know it some women have xxx and never realize it either i got a b in biology
nottheonion,removed,now i can easily filter the that i dont want anything to do with
nottheonion,removed,til i have genders
nottheonion,removed,there is actually xxx and xxy i believe odd mutations of some sort
nottheonion,removed,trump won texas with of the vote compared to mccains years ago its shifting and youre an idiot if every single person held your opinion then it really would mean nothing stop being a bitch about it
nottheonion,removed,right but what im saying is that there is no need to have trans woman transgender woman transgender female transsexual female and transsexual woman when they all mean the same thing these five should just be one category
nottheonion,removed,sometimes you feel like a nut sometimes you dont
nottheonion,removed,was their fursuit covered in genderfluid
nottheonion,removed,of them make sense trans genderqueer and two spirit the rest are just pandering to the extreme progressives
nottheonion,removed,i feel like this is very
nottheonion,removed,maybe we should just go by insertion points
nottheonion,removed,its just the absurdity of it all most on reddit have little issue with being transgender if a little ignorant on the subject what worries most in this situation is the slippery slide of made up bullshit because of the special snowflakes or at least thats how i see it
nottheonion,removed,is it degenerate
nottheonion,removed,i guess im a bigot now cause this seems like a pain in the ass
nottheonion,removed,but does it really hurt anybody since when is this the prerequisite for bullshit to be allowed
nottheonion,removed,aka something that doesnt at all happen in reality ever biology doesnt allow for it there exists no neurological construct that allows for having genders at once let alone anything besides male or female in the first place
nottheonion,removed,not really sex isnt the same as gender nor are there people with other chromosomal makeups there are however genders female and male because evolution has surprisingly cough cough not allowed for development of any other neurological construct that links sex to behavior
nottheonion,removed,basically it boils down to special snowflake nonsense like when my friend dresses in skirts on the days she feels female
nottheonion,removed,why not an option for whats between your legs and where you want that space on other people to be applied to you then we dont have to worry about gender
nottheonion,removed,in a row
nottheonion,removed,just shut up and keep throwing garbage cans through private storefronts because your saudi arabian shill got her promotion denied talk about clowns all you want as long as you guys keep acting like them also gary johnson was the guy that didnt know what aleppo was not trump youre an idiot all the way around literally nothing redeemable about you please commit suicide by cop
nottheonion,removed,that shit is why trump was elected most people are annoyed by this sudden surge of social justice that doesnt affect them in any way seemingly small problems like unusual gender identity are widely talked about in the media yet few people outside socialstudies academia or the trans community think its important for them they feel excluded because widerspectrum problems like unemployment or criminality are relatively less talked about
nottheonion,removed,wat
nottheonion,removed,so all the noncitizen immigrants legal or otherwise cant have an opinion good going unless you are just trolling according to you very fitting username
nottheonion,removed,i identify as a giant flaming ball of hydrogen preferred pronouns sol solaris ra amaterasu duder honestly most of those people in the video havent been on hormones long enough for any discerning individual to not know theyre trans without them even saying anything trace lysette is probably the one exception in that group
nottheonion,removed,yes and no ca tx and ny still have sway and influence simply due to their size and the amount of electoral votes they posses winning ca makes up for losing other states additionally these states are more borderline than you may think california was republican until donald won texas by the same margin he won ohio also people have a fundamental misunderstanding of who the president really represents people think the president represents the people they dont its the united states of america and thats who the president represents the voice of individual states not people senators and representatives are the voice of the people with the federal government and your voice is strongest at your local and state levels as intended
nottheonion,removed,now the more interesting question is how does this work in the other direction do i now have to select yesno for each of the options on whether tinder should show them to me or not or plus one per every custom term someone has entered
nottheonion,removed,pretty sure they are quoting clerks
nottheonion,removed,a lot of people sincerely cannot vote for someone that wasnt their primary choice a lot of others are so far removed from either party that they hated clinton equally communists green party pirate party anarchist weirdos etc the whole notion that you have to be happy about the choice that like of the us gave you in the general election and vote for one or the other is ridiculous
nottheonion,removed,i identify as an attack helicopter
nottheonion,removed,androgyne androgynous this usually means having a combination of masculine and feminine traits last time i check being androgynous was an appearance or behaviour not a gender but hey they keep making up new shit every day to fit their special snowflake bullshit and transsexual people are sadly lumped in with them
nottheonion,removed,it hurts the bottom line because your users get frustrated with your app and go somewhere that has genders max
nottheonion,removed,more power to them i suppose i still bet of the people will still pick malefemale though i am just disappointed they didnt have a gender neutral honeybadgerken available
nottheonion,removed,you can comment on something without saying the shouldnt do that its all about freedom of speech sexual orientation and everything else people have gotten too safe zones and some of us are speaking out we dont need trigger warnings
nottheonion,removed,i hope threemasted schooner is an option nothing ruffles my sails more than intolerance of us shipkin
nottheonion,removed,there are two genders
nottheonion,removed,i believe society should recognize and protect minorities because theyre minorities this is exactly why you have tumblrinas fighting to be their own unique snowflake because you cant get any more minority than that and that means they get special treatment
nottheonion,removed,the far left has lost its mind
nottheonion,removed,so you dont complain when you didnt help cook and you get served a shit sandwich
nottheonion,removed,til there are a whole lot of idiots using tinder
nottheonion,removed,this is why trump got elected you guys realize that right this kind of shit is what people are fucking sick of
nottheonion,removed,only gets you laid
nottheonion,removed,ladies and gentlemen boys and girls and agenders and fluid genders and nonbinaries
nottheonion,removed,its stupid but i dont see why people get so triggered over this
nottheonion,removed,its legitimizing made up bullshit
nottheonion,removed,i ever get the chance im going to take every rapper and hip hop star regardless of color and im going to set them on fire and watch them burn to death rap and hip hop are a disgrace and plauge upon our society and or world
nottheonion,removed,if you think theyre the same youre an idiot
nottheonion,removed,you know what i had a shit day and im drunk right now i honestly dont give a shit have a nice one
nottheonion,removed,the independent is full of shit the only source they gave was wait for it the daily mail the independent is even more bias than the guardian which the bbc basically supports by buying thousands of copies everyday they are posting links on reddit just to get hits take what you read with a lake of salt
nottheonion,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°

nottheonion,removed,nobody even brought up islam lol youre insane
nottheonion,removed,reddit is pretty secular and what i said was tongue in cheek i think it is good to understand why people did things but we shouldnt be justifying them
nottheonion,removed,isnt it pretty dead stateside though
nottheonion,removed,he never said they do
nottheonion,removed,marrying olds is illegal by federal law in the states so i doubt its sarcasm
nottheonion,removed,youve touched a nerve lol
nottheonion,removed,in virginia yea its not an issue

nottheonion,removed,the rest of reddit sat around stunned as the man explained what was going on in his imaginary world

nottheonion,removed,i just pointed out two facts your opinion is that you dont believe in those two facts even though theyre facts youre not entitled to your own facts it is a fact that the quran specifically mentions that pious christians jews muslims and sabeans httpsenwikipediaorgwikisabaeans are welcomed to heaven quran various other mentions of people of the book referring to those who believe in any of the three major abrahamic holy texts old testament new testamentbible and the quran it is a fact that muslims believe in jesus as the messiah and that he will return muslims also believe in jesus as a sinless prophet born to the virgin mary maryam in arabic httpsenwikipediaorgwikijesusinislam muslims also believe he performed many many miracles you pretend that these accounts are untrue thats your problem look it up yourself you really dont and shouldnt take my word for it googles your friend
nottheonion,removed,wait im reading the article and it aid she cosigned on the loans which i suspected i mean yeah dead son and all but whats the actual problem here you have a signature of an able second body to pay back what was borrowed

nottheonion,removed,and his vote matters just as much as your senators there really need to be some basic prerequisites set for being in office like not being a psychopath and on the autism spectrum
nottheonion,removed,he also is responsible for the death of millions of polish russian french people and more throughout europe and the rest of the world years later we moved on maybe its time you guys do too
nottheonion,removed,a lot of tend to forget that jewish people not only killed the tsar in but also killed the tsar in jewish people in the area of russia poland and ukraine were communists in fact communism iswas a jewish invention there were jewish communists in every single country in europe and they were all in contact with each other in fact they were revolutionary communists which meant they went around stealing sabotaging kidnapping and killing and doing things which we would call terrorism today in fact a small group of polish jews managed to turn germany into a communist country for days in when hitler was still a young adult considering this tiny group of preternaturally organized violent and cunning people had managed to seize control of a vast territory of russia and start starving and gulaging and secret policing people the german were within every one of their rights to not only consider all communists a threat but all jews by a reasonable extension and after all jews are supposed to be guests in europe what happens when your guests kick you out of your own bed people get mad and take away the dynamic under which a hostile minority population had heretofore thrived under
nottheonion,removed,wtf what is wrong with white people today do you want to take care of the fucked up incest babies that can happen do you want to pay for their care do you want to live in a society full up on retarded inbred genetic deadend incest babies maybe not in this case but definitely her previous incestuous relationship with her son do you even want to get the genetically fucked up babies to be conceived what the hell is wrong with you boy im all for freedom but at some point in time we cant just let things go not all of us want to live in appalachia not all of us are okay with the human race regressing
nottheonion,removed,in oklahoma marrying a close relative is considered incest whether the relationship is sexual or not and incest is a felony punishable by up to years in prison what is this the middleages if theyre both adults who gives a fuck
nottheonion,removed,being under duress according to the brother like i said these are full grown women who knew what they got themselves into its not for him or anybody else least of all you to say whether or not their relationship is void of any consent given imagine how it would have been if this was just a normal lgbt relationship and the brother was just a conservative bigot who claims his sister was forced into lesbianism youd call him out for that shit but apparently since this involves a type of relationship that you find icky or uncomfortable with youre more willing to side with bigots rather than give full grown adults the right to have a sexual or romantic relationship
nottheonion,removed,the funny part is that this is by its nature abusive and the redditards are clambering over themselves to try and proclaim it legal a son and daughter dont willingly marry their mother so they want boys in the girls bathrooms incest homosexuality drugs importation of death cults and to destroy religion its almost like the devil is running their thought process
nottheonion,removed,your fedoras screwed on too tight if it were a man id feel the same way the state needs to keep out of the bedroom if people really need a selfish reason to honor the principle of personal agency its that baseless moral policing like this sets a precedent that allows things like criminalization of other deviant behavior like homosexuality or alcohol consumption as well just because your dogma is highly prevalent in the place doesnt mean it has the right to interfere with the personal sovereignty of others when theyre otherwise lawful citizens in any case please stick to the topic and dont try to use it as an in to wedge in and soapbox some mra hyperbole
nottheonion,removed,im not sure why the world at large cannot just let go of the fact that its a costume the only people who seem to be butt hurt are the people who are afraid to be scolded by people they know people can dress up as gengis khan or mother teresa and no one cares anymore those famous people are really no different from hitler maybe the reason is because the jewish people rule the world and we are so afraid of displeasing them

nottheonion,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

nottheonion,removed,they sometimes do the wait times for some procedurestests is so long that it actually is a major issue dont get me wrong i love canadian healthcare but it isnt without issues overspending and excessive testing is creating a major problem patients force their doctors to order them expensive and unnecessary tests creating a burden on those who actually need them
nottheonion,removed,what the hell is wrong with you immortal means that you cannot die to die of something else is still dieing in the case of organ rejection if you die before the organ has been rejected then the organ was never rejected something else has happened which prevented the organ from being rejected in thecase of dieing if you die of something else then you still died hence you were in no sense immortal even the parts of you that did no fail died with the whole you died however organ rejection is not the same thing as death if your organ dies for some other reason than organ rejection that it has at no point been rejected therefore the two things are completely different if you still cannot see this then you are either completely stupid or a troll

nottheonion,removed,most parents use the halters only in large crowds by far the vast majority of parents hold their childrens hands and if dogs walked on two legs people would hold their hands as well children only wear clothes because their stupid parents like to play dressup with them as if they are dolls if humans had fur we probably wouldnt be wearing clothes all the time either not once have i ever stepped in a pile of child poop since you have raised two children i am honestly surprised children need to be taught to use the toilet and dogs need to be taught to go outside im sure youve changed your childs diapers thousands of times the only reason dog shit needs to always be picked up is because they dont have a sewage system that does it for them it is really easy to train dogs to crap in the same place every time you just have to teach them like you have to teach children to crap in the same place every time if a dog shits on someone elses lawn then the dog wasnt trained properly just like a person who shits everywhere isnt taught properly the only reason dogs do it more than adults is because its less socially acceptable for adults to shit in public kids have bitten people but no toddler has ever mauled another human to death grade school age children thats because they dont have the jaw strength if a dog gets mad its because they want someone to stop doing something or want something not because they want someone dead just like when a child gets mad if a child had the strength to inflict harm to other people they would use it just as much as dogs do as a mother of former toddlers i am sorry as hell for yours that they have a mom who would compare them unfavorably to dogs show me on the doll where the little doggy touched you you seriously need to think about your arguments before you start spouting so much emotionally charged bullshit

nottheonion,removed,i did not give birth to myself i gave birth to four human beings who are vastly different than me each with their own goals lives work joys it is not okay to not like kids it is not perfectly okay to hate them kids are by far the most vulnerable minority in our world why dont you replace the word kids in your sentence with any other minority try it no one has to like hispanics and its perfectly okay to hate them no one has to like muslims and its perfectly okay to hate them no one has to like lbgt and its perfectly okay to hate them no one has to like blacks and its perfectly okay to hate them no one has to like jews and its perfectly okay to hate them i wish to hell my dumbass childless cousin would go on and do her thing funny think is though she keeps calling my sons over to help her out plumbing lawn mowing painting her house sitting her fucking dogs while she has a vacation cleaning the list goes on and on on the other hand i have never once needed her dogs to do my work and all the time i have to listen to her zeropopulation shit and how she loves her furry children barrff you are deluded if you think doggylove is equal to or better than parentchild love maybe you feel this is true because your parents put as much into you as they would have a puppy from the pound and you are emotionally stunted as a result
nottheonion,removed,yeah expect to see that kind of thing here too in the foreseeable future with modern day women being the insufferable hypermaterialistic bitches that they are its no wonder more and more men are opting out of the game when the rules are stacked so blatantly against them i feel sorry for my fellow brothers who have no clue what to do with their lives if a pair of tits isnt involved that has been granted the power to fuck men over at will and lay claim to half his possessions and his paycheck for the rest of his life not even the alpha guys are safe brad pitt johnny depp george clooney hulk hogan robin williams john cleese they have all been divorce raped by hypergamic bitches who are now multimillionaires without doing fuck all to earn it i hope that someday enough men realize that pursuing a pair of tits and a vagina to stick your peepee in is nowhere near worth the risk and trouble and we crash the whole system undo everything feminism has perpetrated the last few decades and we make women fall in line again so that they become people again who not only demand respect but also earn it

nottheonion,removed,a sign of things to come trump signed the pledge of antiporn group enough is enough during his campaign on its surface it seems to be a pledge that vows to protect children from adult material and exploitation but read a bit deeper and it is really about enforcing standards of obscenity and investigating pornographys effect on families if any of you were around during the clinton years you might remember the communications decency act and what a disaster that could have been for internet free speech this particular group points to such legislation as an example of laws that need to be enforced

nottheonion,removed,it is but if we end up getting too many superconservative people on the supreme court in the next to years they could expand the definition of obscenity
nottheonion,removed,it would be unconstitutional but if trump gets to appoint enough supreme court justices in the next to years its at least possible that they could expand the definition of obscenity
nottheonion,removed,a bill prefiled this month by state rep bill chumley would require sellers to install digital blocking capabilities on computers and other devices that access the internet to prevent the viewing of obscene content id sort of like to see the actual wording of the bill because using software to block obscene content seems pretty much impossible when there isnt a clear definition of what constitutes obscene anyway and a lot of porn probably wouldnt technically meet the criteria of obscene anyway
nottheonion,removed,httpwwwhumantraffickingpreventionactcomassetshtpasouthcarolinapdfs the actual bill if anyone wants to read it
nottheonion,removed,really because im pretty sure we could train a social worker to identify when people may be having ideations of selfharm when talking about why they want to purchase a gun hell half the people who are thinking about committing suicide will probably outright tell the social worker they are thinking of killing themselves or are having thoughts of killing themselves because they dont actually want to die they just want help with their problems and now were making them sit down in front of someone trained to listen to them and help them so yeah there is gun control that could have an enormous impact that isnt take away all the guns of course the nra doesnt like to talk about that so in their messaging the choice is simple police state vs freedom we can have gun control in a compassionate and caring way that addresses mental health issues its neither impossible nor pointless

nottheonion,removed,also because its a tax it doesnt limit your ability for expression or the publishers ability to publish a governmentimposed tax on certain types of speech would almost certainly be inherently limiting and unconstitutional ill admit that i can kind of see your point but it seems unlikely to stand under what youre seeming to say the government could just pose a tax ofi dont know to allow anyone to see content that they dont like and it would still technically be legal if apple or microsoft or some other company decided to impose something like this on their own with them getting the extra themselves it would be fine but the government cant
nottheonion,removed,what an idiotic proposal and overreach of state government here is the actual prefile reps burns and chumley a bill to amend the code of laws of south carolina by adding article to chapter title so as to enact the human trafficking prevention act to require a business manufacturer wholesaler or individual that manufactures distributes or sells a product that makes content accessible on the internet to install and operate a digital blocking capability that renders obscenity inaccessible and to set minimum requirements for the blocking capability to establish a procedure for the consumer to deactivate the digital blocking capability to allow a reporting system to unblock content that is not obscene such as social media websites and authorize a consumer to seek judicial relief if the filtered content is not unblocked within a reasonable time to establish criminal penalties for a business or individual that violates this article to authorize the attorney general to seek injunctive relief against a business manufacturer wholesaler or individual that manufactures distributes or sells any products in this state without a digital blocking capability to establish that a consumer or the attorney general may file a suit against a party that is unresponsive to a report of obscene material breaching the filter and to prescribe damages for each violation

nottheonion,removed,mods killed my post m night shyamalan will return with the last airbender as not oniony its one of the most hilarious headlines ive ever seen and it was rising pretty fast before deletion people like it but one stupid mod doesnt know whats funny about it aaand its gone
nottheonion,removed,given the current upvotes it clearly was deemed by the community as oniony what im concerned by is the seeming political bent it was tagged as repost and not oniony never posted before and onioniness is subjective as you indicate weve had dozens of reposts within where the mods have simply let it go when the pieces have a conservative slant and the same for onioniness there is a willingness to let the community downvote to hell rather than squelch the post at the mod level onioniness is subjective but clearly they blew it here that should be a wakeup call that they need to examine their censorship as to reposts that is binary and wasnt the case here one can only conclude sloppy errors given workload or a bias since it happens to proliberal content a lot i appreciate your summary it is accurate what id add is that many of us use nto as a news source if it isnt free of bias then the value is reduced and the illusion is that this forum is supposed to be neutral
nottheonion,removed,i mean i would but you all never seem to respond to my modmail when something is removed for being not oniony however you seem to have no problem banning me for a couple of days when i just repost it myself this subreddit went to shit when it became public

nottheonion,removed,what has the republican party done in the past that made her want to join with them its not like they have a history of supporting lgbt rights
nottheonion,removed,changing the system from within is greatto the extent that it doesnt force you compromise your integrity or align yourself with people who believe that you are lesser than the whole article is her talking about how her party hates her for an innate part of who she is yet she chooses to remain a member which is in her case an explicit endorsement of the platform that she finds bigoted and personally offensive i fail to see how that isnt selfhating
nottheonion,removed,i agree by the commenter aboves logic all women should vote for hillary because obviously feminism is the only part of tgeir personality that matters

nottheonion,removed,what if youre a gay black vegan
nottheonion,removed,no but when the actual platform of the gop explicitly says the party wants to deny you your equal rights under the law and actively solicits voters who think the same who cares if you agree with them on other issues they dont give two shits about you they would actively strip you of all of your rights if given the chance their platform literally endorsed conversion therapy for lgbt people is your tax cut worth it when the very same party literally thinks they can change your orientation by force
nottheonion,removed,dont you know identity politics is the politics yo
nottheonion,removed,because she lives worrying about gay rights instead of any of the other issues and if she doesnt well shes just a stupid selfhating gay isnt she all because youve decided she is disgusting youre fucking nobody stop pretending that lgbt people are beholden to you
nottheonion,removed,a gay republican thats like a jewish nazi
nottheonion,removed,the republican party shouldnt be ultranationalist or authoritarian unfortunately we do not live in an ideal world where all parties are what they should be the republican party that actually exists is unquestionably fascist
nottheonion,removed,but what about the number one killer assault trucks
nottheonion,removed,its also a pretty legit reason to join a party the left is sold on gay rights being on the lefts party line does zero for gay rights elect a lefty chance right now theyre progay marriage you shouting to add to their charter does nothing because it is already in the charter this person tried to add it to the republican charter knowing itd get shot down but tried if they were in the democrat section thered be a chance theyd make a difference on gay rights and maybe a chance theyd make a difference on their own pet project in the republican section theres a chance theyd make a difference on gay rights and a chance theyd make a difference on their pet project since their project is a bit more republican in interest border security so they can either feel smug and selfsatisfied and have a low chance of changing anything and zero for improving gay rights or they can feel disenfranchised and ignored but have at least a decent chance of changing their pet project and a minuscule chance to improve the lives of gays

nottheonion,removed,im not strongly prochoice but i think abortion should be legal thats literally all prochoice means i still have no idea where so many of you guys got the idea that prochoice means anything other than abortion being legal that said why never voting democrat literally all of the interests youve listed are opposed by the republican platform i dont think the dems are even all that great but you left out the part of your rant where your choice makes sense i think youre supposed to list what pivotal issue keeps you from voting democrat
nottheonion,removed,youre not wrong except that drugs have serious importing to replenish stock guns would have a much harder time so in theory they could be slowly moved out of circulation but i dont think assault rifles are that relevant in terms of gun violence myself even though im crazy liberal fucking handguns man
nottheonion,removed,are you honestly claiming that the military under the obama administration isnt big how can you possibly think thats true what would count as big for you if the us military isnt big enough

nottheonion,removed,this it has nothing to do with you agreeing with of all other republican policies you are part of a party that you want to see become the prevailing voice of the country and if that were to happen you are going to end up being denied your basic human rights it makes no sense
nottheonion,removed,she cares more about a strawman fallacy about democrats weak on defense than her actual rights theres nothing prejudices in laughing at her horrible excuses
nottheonion,removed,a gay republican thats like a jewish nazi
nottheonion,removed,what the hell is wrong with you
nottheonion,removed,gun control is primarily an urban rural argument if you live in a major metropolitan area it would be quite dangerous for everyone to be walking around with guns if you live on acreage a gun could be a useful tool and your neighbors having guns doesnt cause you much concern
nottheonion,removed,can and cant do with your body with tax dollars most of the people who i know are prolife just dont want to help fund it if it were private they wouldnt give a fuck like the birth control thing
nottheonion,removed,the barrel shroud debacle was just too hilarious to not link the video for the benefit of those who haventhe seen it yet
nottheonion,removed,today the answer is the democrats unless you really love ultranationalist authoritarianism sounds good it would be nice to have politicians who actually a care about the country b will fight for the country and c are willing to use the power of the executive to actually change things where do i sign up
nottheonion,removed,your exactly and you could have tried debating but that takes intelligence
nottheonion,removed,the republicans unless you really love ultracommunist authoritarianism see how ridiculous you sound
nottheonion,removed,no thats why black republicans are called tokens or uncle toms for good reason they sold their souls to make a few bucks being tokens
nottheonion,removed,against womens reproductive rights youre definitely misconstruing here you need to acknowledge that there is a factor beyond reproductive rights here
nottheonion,removed,trumps bring yall back to the essentials of selfishness xenophobia and misogyny
nottheonion,removed,and the army told congress we dont need more tanks and yet they keep building them
nottheonion,removed,do you believe the same old pathetic troupe the left wing spouts about republicans if you dont think this is a fair comparison you are part of the problem
nottheonion,removed,and liberals want to literally kill babies
nottheonion,removed,less welfare just think guys we could be using that same money to use drones to kill civilians accidentally
nottheonion,removed,well i will share my opinion on the first issue with this response for reproductive rights it falls in line with personal liberties i believe and most republicans under the age of you can have the right to contraception this does not harm others but when it comes to abortion this in the view of most republicans infringes on the personal right of the unborn fetus it comes down to where you think personal liberties begin and others personal liberties are infringed upon if you think a fetus is a living thing with a soul it should have a right to not be killed right but if you think it is just a sack of cells until it is born then you wouldnt have any problem getting rid of it it is not a person you should be able to get rid a sack of cells in your body if i had cancer growing which is a sack of cells i should have the right to remove them so where conservatives and liberals divide at least what i think i could be totally wrong is whatwho has rights do cancer cells have a rights as a person do fetuses have rights do mexicans have rights trick question of course mexicans dont have rights lol some of them think they are people that was a lot of text i am drunk like fuck i shouldnt be drunk its am and i a have an exam at am for one my computer science classes for which i have not studied if you want me to respond to the other parts of the question i can i dont want to write them out if nobody is interested
nottheonion,removed,im saying that changing the system wont give the people parties that represent their every position isnt that obvious but it would allow voters to have more choice
nottheonion,removed,the democratic party are centrist to centreright by european standards on the whole the republicans are roughly equivalent to the national front uk front national france and various farright parties all over europe sad isnt it
nottheonion,removed,i wish i could like this comment again
nottheonion,removed,my point is that youre arguing against an arugment no one made
nottheonion,removed,also the problem is they advocate for compromise but in actuality its just gun owners compromise and get nothing in return if they offered to say get rid of say the nfa in exchange for universal background checks they might pass it
nottheonion,removed,i really cannot wrap my brain around why democrats are actively seeking to bring in more people who specifically actually hate gay people and i mean by and large most muslims are cool with the idea of killing people for being gay what the fuck that is one group muslims on the planet that is still pretty vocal about bringing actual harm to our neighbors friends and family their moderate stance includes a fucking death penalty for people who are attracted to their own sex
nottheonion,removed,im not so sure while she may agree with many of their positions she says a big part of her being a republican is to do with national defense while libertarians are not pacificists by any means theyre generally against intervention in other countries affairs if you still think the democrats are too soft on these issues even with hillary at the helm then i dont anticipate a johnson vote
nottheonion,removed,found the white person
nottheonion,removed,the analogy is extreme but yes it fits republicans oppose gay rights being a gay republican means you support those who oppose gay rights how was that in anyway inaccurate
nottheonion,removed,im a gay man who works in government for a small conservative town there is a difference between the religious right and small government republicans they arent one monolithic group and i get along great with most republicans maybe you surround yourself with democrats
nottheonion,removed,the democrats are just as authoritarian as the republicans just in different area
nottheonion,removed,its just not his job to take care of his own feelings
nottheonion,removed,we have a totalitarian party and a conservative party there is nothing left leaning about the modern democratic platform what is left leaning about a private health care plan that massively subsidizes insurance companies what is left leaning about drone strikes and continuing a state of never ending war what is left leaning about maintaining neo liberal policies that drive more and more wealth upwards oh but theyre cool with gay marriage so yeah bastions of left wing thought
nottheonion,removed,hbo go or amazon prime really you should already have a prime account
nottheonion,removed,given that the person youre replying to didnt provide any explanation as to why said claim isnt true id say its unlikely that there is one im not saying the dems are by any means innocent of doing the same in many cases but a vast majority of them pretend to oppose it whether or not they actually would do anything to stop the spending
nottheonion,removed,it sure would be nice if republicans would stop claiming every piece of gun legislation no matter how thoughtful or limited in nature as the final step into tyranny
nottheonion,removed,funny thing is most everyone is big on conservation its only politicized issues like global warming with disastrous fixessuggested which dont do anything but make certain people rich that cause divides
nottheonion,removed,not a conservative your comment is misdirected
nottheonion,removed,im not trying to make a statement about race or sexual orientation equating with hobbies outside of politics the basis of my sarcasm is that everyone is painted into a ridiculous corner by a single characteristic via the media and political establishment
nottheonion,removed,on a national level liberal states are a different matter
nottheonion,removed,youre kidding right it was ridiculously over the top
nottheonion,removed,this comment is rbestof material imho
nottheonion,removed,republicans have not been true conservative in generations they destroy rather than conserve valuable things like our economy government services and now they want to get rid of national parks
nottheonion,removed,the left was very quick to rush to the defense of islam after that attack can you provide an example of where the left gave an unprovoked or preemptive defense of islam a lot of people on the left defend islam only when it gets shat on by fox news or any number of public figures to be clear this isnt limited to vocal conservatives see bill maher among others this is because many of us see moderate muslims as allies and thus condemning islam as a whole is not in our best interest as a country
nottheonion,removed,i am a complete novice in how the actual politics play out for things like this but i understand on a rational level that it benefits the us to be relied on by a lot of nations thats how china is as well from what ive gathered and both of countries have a lot of influence and subsequent control
nottheonion,removed,both words apply in this situation
nottheonion,removed,disagreemnt is treason is much more of a current stance of liberals if you disagree with me youre a bigot treason is not quite the word for it but if you believe for a second that liberal hiveminds such as reddit tolerate other points of view see mass downvotes youre delusional
nottheonion,removed,if there was a legit alternative in the libertarian party democrats and gop would lose a huge amount of their base
nottheonion,removed,ah so republicans support gay rights but they just also support a party which actively campaigns against them that makes sense how in your mind do you think that works out you got some serious mental gymnastics going on
nottheonion,removed,of course the only way you justify their position is saying at least they dont want to kill you
nottheonion,removed,thats the thing that really rankles me about clintons platform specifically platform not herself or specific past actions she advocates for being able to sue firearm manufacturers if their product is used to kill someone if theres a fault in the product that causes it to harm the user or someone else thats on them but if it works perfectly well and is used to kill someone thats on the killer not the manufacturer you dont sue toyota if someone runs you over in a camry most of the rest of her platform is either fine good but doesnt go far enough for my taste or something that while i may not agree i can see how someone else would that particular bit is just dumb
nottheonion,removed,thats well presented data and i appreciate that where did you get it i got the yearly gdp expenditures from the rhetoric of we need to be attacking abroad far more is very specific to republicans currently the rhetoric sure but in practice you need to look at the data clinton iraq noflyzones started under bush sr operation restore hope started under bush sr bosnia operation deny flight macedonia sent military personnel to maintain stability hati operation uphold democracy bosnia operation deliberate force libera operation assured response central african republic operation quick response kuwait operation desert strike bosnia operation joint guard albania operation silver wake iraq operation desert fox bombing campaign on iraqi targets i ran out of energy at this point because there are a if you compare clinton to gw bush he spread us all over the world doing world police stuff while gw was just more heavily involved in two specific areas president obama hasnt spread himself quite as far as clinton but did get us involved in libya and syria
nottheonion,removed,they would if they could
nottheonion,removed,conservatives really really libertarians
nottheonion,removed,basic human rights first of all its not multiple things its one thing second that one thing isnt even a right this is coming from someone who definitely disagrees with them on this issue but jesus if i hear the phrase basic human rights again my head is going to explode
nottheonion,removed,the right were very quick to call it only islamic terrorism and avoid any mention of it being an antilgbt attack i heard various republican newspeople were outright stating it had nothing to do with it being a gay club funny how we remember things according to our biases i guess
nottheonion,removed,i can definitely see how you could see it as self hate but couldnt it just be an acknowledgement of the situation and moving past it regardless to further other things it doesnt have to be you giving up your integrity it can just be you moving past that because you care about something else more
nottheonion,removed,its antimatter silly
nottheonion,removed,i care so go play in the road
nottheonion,removed,hey pal youre disgusting
nottheonion,removed,cop lives dont matter
nottheonion,removed,til
nottheonion,removed,lol morons
nottheonion,removed,fuck off i live in alabama and its a beautiful state with a lot of nice people tired of this shit i see on reddit we have a shitty state government and some rednecks but maybe if you people came to visit rather than just driving through bumfuck nowhere or posting on reddit youd realize that it can be a lovely place
nottheonion,removed,the lack of timing prevents us from having proper context here ive been through bad really bad bathrooms in stores before sometimes you open the door and just walk back out no amount of nolongerhavingtoholditin is worth that hell and the employees love pretending its already clean up to and including signing that little sheet on the door if thats what happened and he died within the day then probably the employees should have their families shot inside said bathroom so they can clean it afterwards but its also possible that the old guy really did shit everywhere sometimes you wonder how anything got that high up on the wall or why it got on that wall outside the stall and the employees realized the old bastard was completely lucid just an asshole or that some old man died and his wife came up with something six months later we lack the data here
nottheonion,removed,its oniony in the sense of holy crap so much drug use goes on there that they just flout the law and openly measure it certainly there are good reasons for the policy but it does come off as crazy thing gone too far however merited it may be
nottheonion,removed,you should look into the group christians for michelle bachman it is a really positive and inspiring group fighting the good fight to eradicate marijuanas and gays
nottheonion,removed,its unfortunate that you will never realize how stupid you are
nottheonion,removed,approximately – of the american population is black but they make up of jail inmates and of prison inmates of the million male inmates as of us department of justice census data for of the number and race of all individuals incarcerated in the united states is it cool to be a criminal
nottheonion,removed,dude i can go and buy a shotgun from a yard sale or do a straight trade for a rifle no paperwork private sales require no background check iirc completely circumvent the whole deal youre not from alabama it seems matter of fact after a gun is issued it doesnt have to legally leave a paper trail

nottheonion,removed,guys stocks can swing percent in a day even without any events the number of seems massive but not when it comes to boeings stock price movement what trump said literally had no effect on the stock at the same time boeing is the only large passenger aircraft manufacturer no one else can take that contract the worst thing that can happen is when trump gets into office he reduces the budget by a little bit everyone knows this and thats why it didnt affect the stock the article is just using a clickbait article in my experience watching stocks the average percent swing in a given day is actually percent for high profile stocks

nottheonion,removed,nobody wants to see the connection yeah i get it now nobody sees a connection between the situation were talking about here and the one you were thinking about so that means theyre inventing a strawman when they reply to what you said instead of that thing you were thinking about in your head that noone else sees any connection between and the subject at hand right im glad you deleted your comment it means youve almost reached the point where you can start to take responsibility for your mistakes

nottheonion,removed,great timing
nottheonion,removed,this comment section is a perfect example of how logic just flies of the window for half the population the moment anyone brings up gun rights free assault rifles why the fuck do people think regular citizens need a god damn assault rifle its called an assault rifle and not a fucking protection rifle for a damn reason you fucking right wing idiots
nottheonion,removed,its because gun people are irrational and will use any strawman argument they can so they can win the debate no one sane wants to take find away they want to make it harder to get them for those who shouldnt have them hard to do but its worth talking about like an adult
nottheonion,removed,its blatant defiance and a big f u to anyone that doesnt agree with himprick
nottheonion,removed,i fed my whole family for a year with my gun am i a terrorist stupid fucking liberal
nottheonion,removed,the cockgargler that shot up a school in brazil several years ago used two revolvers
nottheonion,removed,gun control is distasteful youre a special kind of stupid
nottheonion,removed,its not just a matter of formality people get upset because it implies rifles that look a certain way are more dangerous when in fact assault rifles firing mm or cartridges pale in comparison to hunting rounds and rifles
nottheonion,removed,nah hes just celebrating a lot of dead queers his pastor told him the delight he is feeling is perfectly acceptable
nottheonion,removed,watch the crowd go wild when a muslim wins it
nottheonion,removed,because redditors are made up of more people than people who live where that kind of oddity is common you need a license to have a gun in my country nobody is giving them away for free it seems absurd considering the massive statistical problem which america has with guns compared to every other industrialized nation
nottheonion,removed,he literally is changing his plans you fuckin hoser he now wants to give away two so to be clear old plan did not involve giving away weapons then a guy kills a bunch of people new plan involves giving away weapons the plan changed its different now
nottheonion,removed,you can inflict a lot of damage said holt when asked if a person with a handgun would be able to kill so many a molotov cocktail would have done the same thing thats it i give up good luck world
nottheonion,removed,same i had the membership for the damageloss insurance but not worth supporting their drivel i get my insurance somewhere else and when a sensible gun association gets some legs under itself ill join that
nottheonion,removed,yeah weve got a couple for sale near me and both are right in that range
nottheonion,removed,do we take away driving and alcohol from everyone because of the minority whos not responsible no youre a bigot
nottheonion,removed,you think at some point the cop that the rest of the cops pick on said something like you guys want to get a thermal imaging camera or something shut up nerd aaahahaha
nottheonion,removed,well its the only hobby that involves the use of highly deadly weapons that could take out a shit load of people in a short amount of time its sickening how people can justify this to themselves and not realize theyre part of the problem fishing is a hobby gun collection is a murder fetish
nottheonion,removed,yeah the frustrating part is i feel like theres a big audience in that moderate middle however without attractive associations to group up under and feel like they have the support we all just go back to being complacent with the extremists butting heads stalling any forward movement for everyone
nottheonion,removed,or the shoulder thing that goes up
nottheonion,removed,perpetuating homophobia would be disrespectful to the community distributing guns is no more a spit in their face than selling more cars after a car accident perplexing more than disrespectful
nottheonion,removed,my dream is that all of a sudden everybody in a gun shop or gun show pick up a gun and shot everybody around them that would be a great fucking start

nottheonion,removed,disclaimer i do not believe in globalscale chemtrails localscale chemtrails are probably real the only reason global chemtrails would exist is for geoengeineering which is plausible but i think its probably not occurring the fact that you dont understand why something is occurring doesnt disprove that said thing is occurring chemtrail facts httpsenwikipediaorgwikioperationseaspray httpsenwikipediaorgwikioperationbigbuzz unconfirmed yet plausible case of chemtrails the act of government spraying of civilian populations with bacteria mosquitoes chemicals and other substances is already an established fact the only question is whether or not they continued doing so conspiracies can also be historical facts like the examples above are you one of those conspiracy deniers are you a person who plugs his or her ears even when presented with facts i certainly hope not now on to the question of global scale chemtrails sure maybe they are real maybe they arent being used to poison us but are really just a way for the government to cool the planet because there is no other way big oil and big coal arent going anywhere and the planet is in danger if they told us that they were doing this there would be riots in the street hence the secrecy
nottheonion,removed,youre an idiot
nottheonion,removed,okay
nottheonion,removed,no its an acknowledgement that they believe that muslims believe their religion is true the pigs blood is an insult how fucking stupid are you this is basic reading comprehension
nottheonion,removed,thats an unfair comparison the nazis tried to eliminate a demographic that was overwhelmingly peaceful and contributed to society scientifically creatively and financially on the other hand muslims see science as an affront to their religion and want to have people jailed for expressions of happiness in public if islam takes over the west therell be no more theme parks no more music and no more laughter in public places every expression of your humanity will be seen as an inability to show due discipline and chastity to their god it will be a global north korea how do we stop it with dialogue muslims dont want dialogue theyre creating ghettos and installing sharia law everywhere they go and these places become death traps for any nonbeliever who enters these areas when confronted about this they cry islamophobia and racism they dont want dialogue and they know that they can shut it down by accusing nonbelievers of bigotry this is how theyre going to buy the necessary time to lift their numbers in the west and start taking over our governments eventually when they become the dominant demographic theyre going to commit a mass genocide of the nonbelievers as theyve done countless times in the past the west abolished slavery gave rights to women and gays it respects due process and it tolerates lifestyles that make people uncomfortable do we abandon all of these principles muslims will become the most populous demographic in the west when this happens they will install allencompassing sharia law this law is diametrically opposed to the principles that the west has established theyre going to be abolished if they refuse to dialogue with us about the incompatibility between human rights and sharia law how are we going to save these rights from being abolished how are we going to save peaceful intelligent creative people from assured genocide when the muslims take over what do you think we should do
nottheonion,removed,i personally think we should open our borders and doors to the people who chant death to america in the streets who rape women at music festivals whose own women must wear full bodied veils to protect themselves from their men theyre just misunderstood barbarians and we should open our gates and just let them rape and pillage a little bit what could go wrong with two incompatible cultures clashing

nottheonion,removed,you jest but the indian revolt of where we basically started the long fight to kick the brits out of our country was sparked off by rumors that the british were using pig and cow fat to grease the ammo cartridges for the enfield rifles which were being given to the indian soldiers under british command the cartridges had to be torn open with ones teeth and this pissed off both the hindu and the muslim soldiers so much that they shot their commanding officers and started the rebellion against colonial rule which eventually snowballed into the british leaving india for good years later a gun and some rumors about pig and cow fat literally ended the british empire in asia
nottheonion,removed,source the aforementioned i cant offer anything besides rhetoric someone whos about to shoplift likely has absolutely zero incriminating items at hand same with offtrail hiking and tax fraud someone whos planned to commit a robbery at gunpoint has a gun at hand long before he arrives on the scene and a gun free zone sign indicates no law abiding citizens will be armed which is beneficial to the criminal on the other hand a no shoplifting sign just means law abiding citizens wont shoplift which they would do anyway your logic is consistent with rational behavior people arent rational your argument centers around a logical behavior even if its not rational logic the thought is that a sign will create a trigger causing people to consider what theyre doing and in turn possibly reconsider what theyre doing with a noguns sign any crime involving guns is far more likely to be premeditated meaning theyve already made the decision and a sign is far less likely to sway them especially since as i mentioned before it indicates law abiding citizens will not be armed
nottheonion,removed,youre so fragile dude why do you get terrified and delete your comment every time you see my name are you that scared of me keep dancing puppet

nottheonion,removed,this httpwwwwellcomuseraquariusthesishtm seems to in the section of the ancient roman digest of laws dealing with womens claims on their dowries the roman jurist ulpian faces the issue of marriages between women and eunuch slaves he says if a woman marries a eunuch i think that a distinction must be drawn whether he has been castrated or not because in the case of a castrated man there is no dowry if the person has not been castrated then there can be a marriage and so there is a dowry and a claim on i suppose the reason a noncastrated eunuch can get married is because he can procreate digest book xxiii latin si spadoni mulier nubserit distinguendum arbitror castratus fuerit necne ut in castrato dicas dotem non esse in eo qui castratus non est quia est matrimonium et dos et dotis actio est for english translations of roman and byzantine laws see samuel parsons scott the civil law volumes in new york ams press or theodor mommsen paul krueger and alan watson eds the digest of justinian philadelphia
nottheonion,removed,well thats what happens when they start offering gender studies and social studies classes for the masses cancerous ideologies and attitudes causing brain tumours not big surprise
nottheonion,removed,false most rapes are done by someone known to the victim thats not whats being claimed im saying that the minority of cases that involve stranger rapes affect a greater number of people if you compare the amount of impact a single rapist has the impact of a stranger rapist on society as a whole far outweighs the impact a relation rapist has simply because the target range is much larger therefore despite being lesser in quantity will always have higher priority ive already stated this twice clearly to try to acknowledge this stop trying to be deceptive false most rapes are done by a small percentage of men who rape repeatedly this is a good point however consider this another important factor to consider about random rapists versus relationship rapists is that relationship rapists must establish a relationship with their victim first in order to be able to fall into this category what this means is that a relationship rapist will be less mobile and less likely to target individuals immediately furthermore relationship rapists have the advantage of being able to use the relationship to help persuade the victim to not contact police while a random rapist has a more likely chance to be reported most importantly police cannot differentiate between a relational rapist and a regular sexual encounter retrofitted as rape unless a history is established to suggest rape again because of the weight of the charges being held the police must ensure that a case can be built this is one of the major flaws in our justice system because without this a case cannot be made and a guilty verdict is unlikely to be won this results in a waste of resources across the board and massive damage to the innocents reputation seriously thats like saying the police should only pursue bank robbers not muggers this is a poor analogy since muggers do not pursue people that they know in a relationship and usually target randomly a better analogy would be an abusive spouse who steals outright from their sos bank account or steals their assets in this case yes police would most certainly put priority on a bank robber and even muggers over this situation because theres little way for the police to know otherwise however this analogy also doesnt hold because the evidence to prove a rape occurred is difficult to differentiate between consensual sex without a recording or something my point also does not imply that these people should not be persecuted as i pointed out in my last post i am not responsible for your lack of reading comprehension leading to strawmen im not going to do your research for you but here are a few links to get you started if you start from the apriori assumption that women lie constantly then yes this is part of rape culture that bitches always be lyin this is not actually the problem i was pointing out please stop attempting to strawman me because you lack basic reading comprehension instead the point that i was making was the fact that many in addition because of the very nature of prostitution it is difficult to actually test whether or not a woman was raped because of the nature of her work remember the police cannot just go on the fact that a woman claimed she was raped considering that people have abused the system before something that you fail to acknowledge in your response as i stated in the end of my last post by tightening the definition of rape so that more evidence can actually be obtained to verify rape cases would help this problem dramatically it would help literally thousands of women but you would rather wait for feminism to do the job for you something they clearly have had profound difficulty in achieving how pathetic oh you mean that pesky that bothers so rape deniers the problem is not what the number is but how the number is obtained how exactly is the number of people who make false rape claims adequately measured clearly considering large cases such as the rolling stone debacle have happened it only logically holds that there are false rape cases however because of the nature of a false rape claim it is impossible to know with certainty what cases are false and what cases are not no amount of numerical juggling will change this fact despite this however what im pointing out is that even if we accept these values as true the point does not hold this is not addressing the fact that you literally pulled that number out of nowhere please cite your sources no an extremely emotionally written atlantic article doesnt count were doing that its called feminism unfortunately feminism has done quite poorly at changing the numbers hasnt feminism existed for literally decades at this point if they were doing an effective job at doing so rape would not be a growing problem as feminism tries to imply it sounds more like an excuse at this point to avoid addressing the problem from a problemsolving perspective and simply ascribing to what you think sounds nice do you not notice the problem with expecting a group to try to change the world for you if you really cared about these women you would not be relying on a political movement to try to help them a political movement with a questionable effectiveness and public image in the last decade you would be moving independently to work hard to actually help women what makes you think being a keyboard warrior is helping women who are being raped by their spouses weekly unfortunately one problem with being human is that we cannot apply ourselves to every injustice in the world you clearly cannot put enough effort whether it is for logistical reason or otherwise to actually go and help women and assume that feminism will do so i believe that i should acknowledge my ability to help women and contribute towards an injustice that i can actually improve with problemsolving approaches if i contribute all of my effort towards solving problems i will contribute far more towards society than any single feminist who blindly follows their movement can of course you dont have to renounce your beliefs in equality for women simply function independently from a movement that appears to be ineffective especially when there are better ideas to address these problems anyways for me i focus my work on the blind instead since i have a lot of ideas about that what i do is instead of participating in large activist groups i actively try to solve the problems that make it so that blind people struggle in society today in fact blind people struggle leagues harder than women and the challenges that affect them will require much more work to overcome so i ask you this why not seek solutions to these problems independently instead of filling your mind with numbers and mantra why not try to understand how the system actually works and actually come up with a solution independently as i stated previously the problems of the unclear definition of rape and the inability to build proper testing protocols for these unclear definitions make it extremely difficult to weed out these issues even if every single person was acting in the womans favor furthermore you offer absolutely no evidence outside of a news article to substantiate your claims i am not opinionated on the subject and simply request you to adequately support your opinion please actually put in effort this time instead of regurgitating what others say because its seriously making me question your intelligence
nottheonion,removed,tell your imaginary friends i said hi
nottheonion,removed,hey mods this isnt oniony
nottheonion,removed,theres also the dwarves which are an anti semetic caricature whatever tolkiens sympathies were to the jews because they draw on and reinforce the anti jewish stereotypes that doesnt make any sense how can they reinforce jewish stereotypes if they were not explicitly jews nor did tolkien intend them to represent jews it would be antisemitic to suggest that it has such a meaning where there isnt because then that would be you inserting antisemitism into a text that has nothing to do with it

nottheonion,removed,read the comments the fact is the female thor sold less copies that is reality dude i have no idea why people constantly try to defend this shit and act like it isnt happening some femtard tried to write an article claiming it was selling better which is just not true
nottheonion,removed,ok gang as a advertising copywriter i learned years ago to never try and write hip otherwise you string too many cliches together and thats not how people talk i still remember being a college radio dj back in the and having to read live this awful commercial copy that was obviously written by a thenmad man trying to sound young well youve heard it through the grapevine havent you that country club malt liquor is into a super fine giveaway thing the gig is this spoiler for you kids the gladys knight song was atop the charts and country club was a secondary brand of schlitz beer which is also history
nottheonion,removed,if the dude hasnt made any effort to contact his family in the states and has a wife and kids in nk theres a possibility that kidnapped is the wrong phrase to be using i think if the state department were to get involved it would be about the dudes actions while in nk rather than any claim of kidnapping
nottheonion,removed,no a fact is not what the public and media remembered that is an insidious belief it is indisputable that giuliani remembered in the video clip that is a fact just because trolls like you and reuters deliberately lied and a large number of idiots fell for it does not create a fact it is because of shit like this that trumpkins will claim the media is corrupt and liberals are stupid you are shooting yourself in the foot

nottheonion,removed,if you are so interested in remaining loud and ignorant an unattractive combination to be certain then by all means keep posting brash and needlessly confrontational posts on topics that you dont fully understand a brief look at your very new account shows you to be off to a disappointingly angry and juvenile start if youre simply a troll then by all means keep trolling but if youre a real new user with any interest in intelligent debate and discourse then id contemplate how i want to conduct myself on this forum again youre off to a bad start becuase loud and ignorant are an unattractive combination

nottheonion,removed,im truly sorry youre voting for trump
nottheonion,removed,once the election is over we will in time itll take a while the thing to watch is the continued white hatred if that continues and if you see the demographic changing at unnatural rates expect people to stay upset and things to get much worse the powers that be must stop talking about whites being evil if you demonize ostracize and hate people you leave them only one option and that is to hate back the old republican party is dead weve entered an era of racial politics in the us just like in europe unfortunately the powers that be actually pushed for that this sounds crazy and i would have never believed it just years ago it is true though you cant have obama laughing at whites like its a joke that they feel this hatred it is very real and until this is acknowledged expect things to get much worse
nottheonion,removed,yes i actually made two points

nottheonion,removed,thank you for the response i gather that youve been explaining your understanding of the law and not necessarily sharing your pov ive got to admit i think a lot of what youre telling me sounds really dumb not that that is your fault maybe this is just a fringe example where the defendants case seems more sympathetic than you would typically find in these kinds of cases and im biased what do you think
nottheonion,removed,this response also works as a notsosubtle jab that most of the protesters probably dont have jobs
nottheonion,removed,well thats sure to clear up all the protests if they start handing out job applications
nottheonion,removed,i hope they dont actually hire any of those racist thugs
nottheonion,removed,yes its too soon you fucking prick
nottheonion,removed,that is a big assumption
nottheonion,removed,funny how you dont see hundreds of law enforcement officers and familiessupporters out marching in protests in cities all across the usimo bc they all are employed or have things to do and realize standing in groups for hrs and chanting blocking traffic destroying property waving signs and being disruptive is not an effective way of winning peoples hearts and minds it only makes people angry and puts protesters and surrounding citizens and law enforcement in danger its a ridiculous ineffective method of expressing feelings or support
nottheonion,removed,i believe most police officers will put their lives at risk to protect citizens then i believe youre naive as fuck
nottheonion,removed,a friend of mine is a construction manager and this morning his workers came into a brand new apartment under construction to find black lives matter spray painted in hot pink across a freshly sheet rocked and painted interior wall we were joking that they should pin job applications up on all the doors to keep blm protestors away looks like this police chief is in on the joke
nottheonion,removed,no you just like taking dumb counterpoint positions online because youre bored go find something else to do
nottheonion,removed,hiring criminals to run the police
nottheonion,removed,but the chief needs to understand the protests are about a nationwide issue of use of force with police yeah which is retarded the facts need to come out there is video evidence that alton sterling was not complying with police and was using force back and may have even reached for a gun there is no proof of anything yet in the castile case just a woman saying he got shot for nothing and of course reddit took that video at face value now conclusions have already been jumped to and police officers have likely died over it
nottheonion,removed,ha the protesters dont actually want to work and change anything they just want to cry throw tantrums and go into a violent frenzy until civilized humans cave in and give them free shit and special privileges
nottheonion,removed,theyre far right and im not for starters when they start bashing liberals in the same way that limbaugh does they lost me even in this thread people are using liberal as a slur so for starters fuck you there second the fearmongering is out of control every time anything happens them libruls coming to take your guns cue every wal mart being sold out of ammo thats been marked up like seriously at this point we have seen among other things a sitting member of congress and a bunch of year old kids shot if obama didnt come take your guns after that hes probably not going to third there can be no discussion and every limitation on guns is unacceptable for example my state just made it legal to take guns into bars thats idiotic i like guns i like booze the two do not mix you do not need a mean drunk packing a gun fourth their scenarios are ludicrous fact is that crime is at an all time low other fact is that the odds of you stopping an on going violent crime with your gun are astronomically low yes i know it happens no not enough to matter lets stop pretending that the world outside is some post apocalyptic death zone where you will be immediately killed by criminals if you dont have gun you wont fifth sort of in the same vein the gun rights nras solution of just add more guns is very often stupid you know what would not have helped the orlando pulse shooting if a bunch of people drinking and possibly doing drugs in a loud dark nightclub had a shitload of guns and yet thats what people think is a good idea like i said common sense seems to have left the nra a long time ago guns are dangerous yet for the typical end user there are fewer regulations on them than a car lets stop pretending like the slightest regulation is a personal affront to god and the ghost of james madison
nottheonion,removed,reported for not being onioney despite all the sjw and black lies matter peacocking most cops arent cruising around looking for minorities to shoot
nottheonion,removed,i agree the protesters are claiming that there is a problem in the police department why not fix it from the inside if they want to make a difference then why not as the people theyre complaining about so you see a problem with the bloods gang why not fix it by joining up and following orders from the higher ups in exchange for cash payment

nottheonion,removed,agreed putting up billboards like this just further perpetuates the idea that muslims and other poc shouldnt be seen and treated as individuals

nottheonion,removed,in any case since you seem so keen on saying that your point of finding jobs with a tourist visa is ok be my guest if you think im making shit up and deleting stuff and apply for a tourist visa at a us consulate telling them that youre just going there for job interviews see how well the visa goes some people are just too fucking hardwired to win an argument that they know isnt true but they think otherwise thinking itll benefit their situation so much for placebo effect
nottheonion,removed,because getting your bike stolen is just as bad as half the school seeing naked pictures of you and harassing you and picking on you look i understand you are probably in a rebellious phase but sexting is just bad all around wait until you are at least out of high school you go to school every day and see the same kids every day if you send a nude picture to someone and it gets passed around your school you are going to face the harassment of your peers when you are in college its different you dont have to see the same kids every day and colleges are much bigger the effect is much more mitigated
nottheonion,removed,you brought up getting your bike stolen as it relates to sexting pictures being spread throughout a school getting your bike stolen is in no way and in no universe as serious as your naked pictures being spread the fact that you brought up getting your bike stolen pretty much tells anyone with a brain stem that you equate the and in a modern society that are not even remotely similar in severity but whatever

nottheonion,removed,and its a fucking article by bloomberg
nottheonion,removed,normally i wouldnt respond to something like this but for specifically education i will first your sourceslinks are laughable every single thing i linked is a peerreviewed article or links directly to peerreviewed articles i was very careful about that it looks like you didnt click a single link weeded through to find one possible angle to squeeze your confirmation bias in then didnt even bother to click the link to notice that the article itself links to and properly cites multiple studies and ironically does a fine job of talking down a claim you made later on second your strawman argument of what republicanslibertarians believe is ridiculous apparently not because you self identified as a libertarian then rallied to defend the exact claims i made from the exact stance i said you would if im wrong you did a damn terrible job of proving it by literally doing the thing i said you would do third there is no credible relationship between cost of education and quality of education actually there is of the credible peerreview sources i just linked to and the additional studies cited in the link of them directly show this with a correlation relationship and of them show a directly causal link one of which is published to an economics publication using microdata analysis which youd know already if you clicked on any of the links and the range and breadth of the studies are both domestic and international and since theyre scholarly peerreviewed articles list their methods for everyone to cross examine which has been done extensively throwing money at the problem wont work you know how i know that cause it has never worked except not only has it worked out just marvelously but i just linked to a ton of scholarly peerreviewed research showing exactly that in fact throwing money at problems has historically been a fantastic way to fix problems not just in education either but its especially fantastic in education because as the previously cited research shows you never get less than a roi and you often get more than a roi for higher education and up to a roi on early education specifically its almost like this is an extremely heavily studied phenomenon in every developed country around the world has been examined by many of the greatest minds in all of history theyve shared their data with other great minds and some notsogreat minds for good measure and then they all examined and debated all that evidence and then published them into papers a few of which i linked earlier so people like you could ignore it but to quote my previous post of course citing study after study that proves educational funding cuts and underpaying teachers to be a societywide disaster wont persuade them so repeating myself probably wont do much but im an optimist and im going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume youre a smarter person than youre currently representing yourself as and that the world is grey enough that you can be a libertarian and also realize a good investment when you see one its actually perfectly reasonable to want the government to back away from various things and youre more than welcome to that worldview however when you get have your tax dollars give a return for the economy even the most frugal of people would need to be a fool not to make that investment anyhow the researchers in those publications make a very strong case for why you are mistaken on pretty much everything you just said if you would like to come back with counterarguments that are well cited from reputable peerreviewed scholarly research id be happy to read that research and take it into consideration i would be quite shocked to see it however because i have looked for such research in the past since part of doing research involves attempting to debunk your own claims and havent really found any there is however a mountain more of research beyond what i just linked i thought multiple sources per claim would be enough for an offhand reddit post though

nottheonion,removed,somehow everyone who dislikes trump is simultaneously a faggy pansy coward wimp and also a dangerous violent radical
nottheonion,removed,cool sidestep if you dont see the unbelievable danger of a presidential candidate and now president calling for violence against protesters then youre a fucking retard but youre a trump supporter so that was already clear
nottheonion,removed,make me dude oh right keyboard warrior
nottheonion,removed,its ok to attack minorities across the entire country but its not ok to note trump supporters are ignorant and hateful yup totally what i said nice reading comprehension btw you should totally keep calling people on the right racists it is totally winning peoples minds over to supporting your cause s
nottheonion,removed,you are a moron

nottheonion,removed,youre either a little boy or a retard if youre comparing dicks based on porn just going to a us locker room will show that the vast majority of american men are walking around with little flaccid wangs more comparable to japanese male pornstars than american pornstars

nottheonion,removed,nice pits deserve everything they have coming for them
nottheonion,removed,nobody cares
nottheonion,removed,what the fuck is the point of pitbulls
nottheonion,removed,shouldve punted the shit out of that cat and sent it to kingdom come no one fucks with my dog
nottheonion,removed,the guylady deserved it cat is the hero here
nottheonion,removed,i would have killed that cat with my own hands
nottheonion,removed,getting shot hurts says soldier who has shot at men lol hammering your thumb hurts says carpenter lol thats the dumbest statement ive read all morning congratulations
nottheonion,removed,youre the only cat groomer ive encountered so far cat groomers are for being assholes
nottheonion,removed,your mom at least thats her favorite position
nottheonion,removed,cats injuring dogs good
nottheonion,removed,clearly this story and your scientific analysis proves no pitbull has ever harmed another human or animal in known history bravo
nottheonion,removed,stupid dogs should have torn that cat to pieces
nottheonion,removed,boo hoo who cares about your cat when a cat attacked my hamster it died
nottheonion,removed,that only happened on remote islands and if you introduce any apex predator to a closed ecosystem thats bound to happen so stop fucking over exaggerating
nottheonion,removed,the incident shows that pit bulls dont deserve the bad reputation they are sometimes stuck with grover said well if you ignore the literally thousands of examples of why pit bulls have a bad reputation sure
nottheonion,removed,cat should of killed the pit bulls dogs should be extinct
nottheonion,removed,its funny that your cat is dead
nottheonion,removed,f you consider only the much smaller number of cases that resulted in very severe injuries or pit bulltype dogs are more frequently identified i was referring to that
nottheonion,removed,if youre a groomer and you dont understand the bacterial infections caused by cat bites you should go pump gas for a living instead
nottheonion,removed,youre a fuckin idiot dude
nottheonion,removed,thats possibly the worst argument ive ever read so you apparently dont read very much that explains a lot the point is that we see animals introduced into a ecosystem are problematic in many many cases as are the humans themselves whether its rabbits and and cats in australia racoons and grey squirrels in europe or pythons in flordia httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinvasivespecies tend to wipe out native species and cause serious problems for the local ecosystems sure some travel between continents is normal for most species and sometimes a species dying out is just how nature works and should work but humans have managed to speed up that process to a degree that could endanger our very survival with cats the problem is actually double by the way calling humans in north america an invasive species wouldnt be entirely wrong either a good years isnt much time by the standards of evolution and even as some new evidence suggests wouldnt be very long native americans are in no way as native as bears or buffalos are eg early humans may have had an httpsenwikipediaorgwikiquaternaryextinctioneventhuntinghypothesis sure in most places beside australia and some islands domestic cats on their own would only compete with native felines and not cause too much trouble the problem is that the cat population in the western world is increased by humans who feed and protect domestic cats
nottheonion,removed,my ancestors are smiling at me bitches can you say the same
nottheonion,removed,i am going to sue you so you can sell my lawsuit
nottheonion,removed,true but you can get an asthma and panic attack at the same time smoking making timers think that theyre gonna die you can also have an allergic reaction or get stuck with fakelaced weed in states where its illegal it can also make you suicidal or violent if there is something wrong with you or the weed
nottheonion,removed,catlivesmatter
nottheonion,removed,so you dont have a point im happy to continue this conversation but youre going to have to add a little more substance to your troll anything there has to at least be someone around you with an original or intelligent thought
nottheonion,removed,ill never understand why some people who make edibles dont make another batch of normal treats because youll end up getting them mixed up and eating brownies that you thought were normal best to just not make the normal brownies and not risk getting them mixed up while youre high
nottheonion,removed,oh im sorry i thought this was america
nottheonion,removed,oh im sorry i thought this was america
nottheonion,removed,instead of making a statement designed to invoke sympathy true or not perhaps offering clarification would be more productive
nottheonion,removed,because you are being a dense motherfucker
nottheonion,removed,found the white knight
nottheonion,removed,not sure if trolling or satire either way in poor taste
nottheonion,removed,ok sure but thats why the english legal is system is full of kickass barristers like the one who wrote the blog post the source of the story theyre the ones who get employed and paid to practice its why theres a court system that allows for detailed crossexamination of witnesses by both parties its why the jury is directed by the judge to not convict unless they are sure beyond all reasonable doubt and innocenct until proven guilty there is a long line of common law and legal principles already in place for what you are describing youre only considering the rights of one injured party and thats a bad way to go about making criminal laws deterrents like the one youre calling for are just catchall and would in the long run make it a lot more difficult for facts to come out in court cases shitty liars break in court because their stories eventually dont match up with the evidence and in court literally everything you say and have already said is under scrutiny trust me when i say even if that barrister hadnt caught onto it being shades of grey shed have gotten him off it is far harder to lie to get someone convicted than it is to lie to be set free
nottheonion,removed,no i was saying once you become a teenager usually you mostly know about all the dirty and twisted shit in the world
nottheonion,removed,for some reason i think youre actually a troll cant quite put my finger on why
nottheonion,removed,so let me get this straight this person bukakebaratheon talks about his or her parents hisher name is very sexually explicit and gross and then some of you pipe up and offer this alleged kid a way to get around being protected by hisher parents good going you are treading way close to child abuse and pedophilia way close
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,ken m is a troll link to vox video about him
nottheonion,removed,because part of the purpose of the criminal justice system is retribution some people will say differently but theyre wrong the other part is rehabilitation this bitch needs both she has serious mental health issues unfortunately prison time will exacerbate those issues however she should pay some form of restitution
nottheonion,removed,i mean weve had a monkey in the white house for the last eight years may as well keep it going
nottheonion,removed,i know youre joking but looking through your history you have a really hard time spelling and making proper sentences
nottheonion,removed,pretty illogical if you wander through life now imagining others especially strangers think the best of you youre pretty delusional
nottheonion,removed,harambetrain makeamericajungleagain
nottheonion,removed,i think
nottheonion,removed,i say read it all and do your best to somehow prepare against having piece of shit children like these
nottheonion,removed,pretty sure thats the first time a japanese mans penis was too big
nottheonion,removed,its not that all women are like this its the power imbalance its like under jim crow not every white person was out to harass oppress and possibly even lynch random black people for fun most just wanted to live their lives but for those whites who were so inclined they were definitely empowered to do so in that scenario it would make sense for blacks to be nervous around whites even if most were decent people its not that every one is evil but all the evil ones are officially endorsed by the state when they choose to act this way its the same with this women arent evil but the ones who are are almost entirely free to do this sort of thing and face no consequences
nottheonion,removed,because her story fell apart and she confessed if shed been a bit better at lying well we dont need to speculate there are a number of stories of women who told a very convincing lie and got men jailed for rape with zero physical evidence he should be grateful his daughter wasnt a slightly better sorryteller
nottheonion,removed,except the whole point was that he wasnt found guilty you stupid motherfucker
nottheonion,removed,how dare a person even accuse a man of rape clearly that should be forbidden
nottheonion,removed,and actual rape is mostly committed by men which mostly goes unreported by people like you who think every white dude accused of rape is actually a victim of a false rape accusation
nottheonion,removed,whoa hey come on shes obviously a horrible person but lets not go that far even hitler didnt post to srs there are limits man
nottheonion,removed,do you have any proof of that at all i mean obviously false accusations are horrible but i really dont think they happen nearly as often as mras would have you believe
nottheonion,removed,you do have a point there and i agree the punishment needs to be more severe i think my issue with his comment was that by comparing the two it seemed like he thought that men are as oppressed as black people during segregation which is extremely untrue
nottheonion,removed,id just like to point out its not just mentally unstable men who rape people
nottheonion,removed,female
nottheonion,removed,shit
nottheonion,removed,you people disgust me seriously everyone laughing about this and posting idiotic jokes only neaderthals would find this amusing its things like this that cause me to lose faith in humanity to those laughing about this here put yourself in his shoes and try to imagine what having a story posted on the internet would means to you your family your parents your siblings and consider japanese culture do you think his mom and dad and siblings are laughing and to the reporter and editor who published this story fucking think before you publish a story that will ruin another persons life its hard enough to move on with your life failing to make the olympics under regular circumstances every day for the rest of this mans life he will remember this and have to face the humiliation imagine having to go to work every day for the rest of your life with this hanging over your head people commit suicide over things like this especially in asian cultures you going to be laughing if he commits suicide over the shame at the very least all of you laughing here share the responsibility of the pain he will suffer for the rest of his life over this so fuck the reporter dan elsom the website newscomau the editor all of you posting here and the reddit mods for not blocking stories that destroy an innocent persons life this did not have to be turned into a news story
nottheonion,removed,what makes this even more funny is that asians have little wangsif you know what i mean

nottheonion,removed,go fuck yourself
nottheonion,removed,i keep seeing this same comment everywhere there are minor variations of course sometimes its circus and other times its shitshow or other similar things i dont think the people making these comments are well informed or intellectually impressive do you realize that people as stupid as yourself have been repeating this same quote for decades during every presidential election just like stupid people have been saying for years that climate change will splinter the poor defenceless earth in two tomorrow just like stupid people have been waiting for the world to end and fulfill ragnorakarmageddonetc let me provide you with a good rule of thumb if you think it its probably fucking stupid
nottheonion,removed,lpt never call the cops on a girl you will end up in jail she will say you beat her or raped her
nottheonion,removed,what a terrifying viewpoint holy shit
nottheonion,removed,convincing you of something thats fairly obvious in and of itself is way down on my list of things to do or to rephrase that looking up evidence to verify my bias will probably prove me wrong so ill dodge it by claiming my schedule is too busy while on reddit

nottheonion,removed,to answer your shittily veiled question no i am not a trump supporter seems all you can do is try to pigeonhole people you are obviously far too dense to understand that this isnt a semantics argument ive explained this in more than one way and you are stuck on a totally unrelated tangent your argument is that i think pain is subjective and therefore irrelevant that isnt even close to the point i have given you my point very explicitly more than once and in no uncertain terms you are stuck ok the concept if subjectivity and it has killed your argument
nottheonion,removed,that doesnt make sense because its not a us airport and only trump would do such a thing

nottheonion,removed,all conservative states do this remember when oklahoma voted against aid to the northeast after hurricane sandy only to turn around and ask for aid when they were hit by tornadoes years ago

nottheonion,removed,without looking im going to assume they are all republicans or libertarians or a combo of both these people are not antigovernment they are selfish humans who are happy to let others suffer but want handouts when they are in trouble again they will be bailed of by the rest of us and again they will go back to being selfish humans who will vote against helping their fellow man next time it comes up

nottheonion,removed,yes they are there dead people have a tendency to be in other places more though ive notice it with the rothfellers tons of them running around most of them are aggressive as hell though i ended up knocking one up almost sucessful now its all dead and diseasemeaning that the mission is incomplete so a flake decided to run up during this whole time and attempt to kick me out of my edu i got severely pissed off you get tired of people wanting to take advantage so you go and do something about it while its easy to eat bon bons and do nothing its least of a thing to actually get off your butt and go and do it ive find this in most particular situations the bon bon heads are the most useless but chatty their of course are the fake blu variety that is most questionable meaning motive or action their quick to scooop something up but even that too backfires i wonder how she is doing with syphilis in the mouth who wants an unclean woman calling herself cleaning others with her mouth mine is virgin and clean therefore it is most pure purity is essential in dividing this divisionary purity is what the world still lacks i remembers praying much about it but in this you need w there are secrets kept deep very inside
nottheonion,removed,there hamlets are still there some of them good the others not but the hamelts are basicually the essence of the person or whatnot im been awhiule since ive played heoric its strange but now im not so afraid of te night but i do remember it in those situations this little pathetic blo would have served as no representative honestly i am shocked they allow these smallminded type of girls there i hope she has been scolded mightly by the mischeviousness that she has presented i saw the robattack bunny because i know more about the bunny than the other one does this bunny serves as nothing more than a sidetrap and explosive unit the robo grabs others and is never satisfied it in actuallity is a rather disgusting incompetent and insecure female however this one has also found out the relation of that bunny to the other one as well as the others also too this one has found several others as well the peac king that sits around the one who should be indeed at the npole he is beneath the catacombs and comes out only at night he use to come out in the morning but i think hes avoided it hes called the go king ive known this go king but he is quit dangerous all my letters everything gone ruined that which i have worked hard for the filthy foxes and the others have stolen so i must return the favor to the filth bunnie soon her area of dwelling shall smell of my secret perfume i have reserved just for her may she smell of the secre la that is most quiant also as well too if you watch enough the little privilege c serves nothing more than a false gatkeeper honestly who is going to take this girl who is beneath me to began with words i see how they have trained some of these little preissies much sin also girls trying to grab girls and whatnot its very hypocritical and sadly some of them wontmake it on the otherside standing up for what was right nearly earned myself boot i know that america is plenty filthy and majority of american girls are prissy and no good so called friends who turn on each other at the drop of the dime this again years going down the drain those who steal take and grab to satisfy themselves if i had the right ones but no you talk to the females and what they do automatically think its for them it was never but now i have avoided the sylphilis i bet the little snobs mouth is burning up quiet nice the bizzareness of the others now i have seen this other thingso many of my pictures ohotos and emblems the true face of america is that pigslop that is why i have told and we have told get the d and travel the world as i wanted to i want to be able to get married and travel like i was suppose to instead of being convinced by scared yes when you are vaulable you are worth very much also i need to sort of family assets i see that the backwards hackers cove decides it is alright to help themselves to my inboxes and phones but i still have that which they cnat obtain in messages his voice i still have that voice that i talked to the one that called my name the one that breathed out my name he liked a lot of music as i have so those things have been upgraded but much tyrnany and wickedness has occured as a result of it they punished the children very severely that r one is such that needs punishment because of the mischeftouenss using territory and the same pitiful gangup mentallity these pathetic little bunch of rabbits would be the first ones to run out of a storm but now they think they have the upper hand never in my life have i seen such a diaster a father thats too intimate with his d and more its a house of sinners now i see that i am in the sinners house a house where p is permitted but on private i myself have been severly tarnished so close i was in getting him but the so called rob bunny is quiet pitiful i see little fastjobs like this and quiet honestly she should have her title revoked because of the mischefviousness that i caught them red handed in now my other one has done such a thing i was climbing higher and higher now they want to come out with all those n symbols and whatnot that have been ran into the ground so this is what they want brainwashfors be in the meanwhile he is laughing he says i have the last laugh but he doesnt the grave has already been rolled away and victory is those who believe it once converting back over things will make more sense women have a tendency of two things massive pecking orders but there is a key method to this i look and i see beautiful things which has started it all but then it transgressed and it literally belt as if i was carrying more of the wishes of the m than my actual own the constant fussing blowing up and anger shouts i what i remember sjhe had also taken away all my vitamins and mixes this has become almost like an interference but as well too so called friends looking at each other as benefits this bl needs to be bounced already dating then stealing another we get tired of these bossy angry and rather pathetic attacking females wanting to grab other men a married man who carries disease and sickness how grand if the man is sick you dont go down trying to grab at him with another guy ontop of it now here i am seething these are the type of nastie and fitlthy couvetness little girlchilds that need to be exposed ive seen her that is true however it is also true that that one has been known for such things
nottheonion,removed,ive been abadoned by that asshole so much yes insanity runs because of that stupid we must keep our line clean by banging each other now there is disease and filth and they want people to clean it up and fix it ha you spread filth you get filth perhaps the other ones mouth shall be filled witht he measles and sylphilis as well i bet shell transfer it to the boyfriend as well too which is disgusting filthy varmits the lots of them i bet shes doing it so she can ease her way in but shes nothing more than a sideplate this sideplate buster mentallity is entirely wrong it does not make one immune to disease but the purpose to spread it same that everytime a war goes on i keep seeing the ger js flying now i know why because their big santaclaus s keeps their coffers filled sadly they actually worship this old pussfart as g but this guy has much behind him because of the dnet that needs to be shut than open is it worth what it has caused the minetwork was a more beneficial solution

nottheonion,removed,actually thats usually not the case and if it was the consequences of a us vs them mentality among kiteflyers would be kind of less severe

nottheonion,removed,illogical behavior is the inevitable consequence of an illogical belief system islam resolves nonviolent disputes with violence people who resolve nonviolent disputes with violence arent logical because the logic or evidence or morals one might use to justify an action is or are violently opposed when violence is a means to resolve nonviolent disputes theyll always be hypocrites because the rules they claim to live by are not only inconsistent with themselves but cannot be logically morally or empirically justified islam can never be logical can never be moral and can never be scientific so long as they resolve nonviolent disputes with violence

nottheonion,removed,yeah but a simple thats not oniony would have sufficed
nottheonion,removed,the point of the conversation is that you called somebody out for making a perfectly reasonable comparison and then when asked why he was wrong you made up some bullshit because you were too stubborn to admit that it was kind of a dumb thing to say now im trying to understand how somebody could think that way and ive gotten nothing but you dont get it and you never will face it chief you lost i wear the crown and you bathe with the peasants
nottheonion,removed,i didnt want to make it a contest but you insisted on not laying out your point thoroughly it made you seem weak i dont think you understand that youve been agreeing with me the entire time and it was your original statement about irrelevant child comparison that was coming into question

nottheonion,removed,yes because the the whole clinton family are on the take theyre complete scumbags devoid of integrity httpwwwbreitbartcomclintoncashmovie
nottheonion,removed,quick reminder im stuck kind of defending something i dont agree with so this is more of an intellectual exercise than anything else i find your point an interesting one and dont totally disagree my question would be what you propose be done instead save climate change discussion for college students who are specifically studying the science of climatology the consensus is well known so this isnt simply an example of educating children and remember targeting children than cant properly form their own opinion on the subject is the primary objection here i would expect that you suggest a more complete description of the current state of discourse in the scientific community since of scientists agree that humans are the primary cause of global warming would you suggest that the amount of time spent on other theories would be proportional to the percentage of scientists that disagree it seems to me that would be the fair thing to do not giving more weight to a lessbelieved theory but im not sure that of the time in a climate change unit would be enough to say anything useful firstly and this is something i believe in personally we need to teach children that consensus isnt science and science isnt based on a consensus we cant vote on facts and a majority doesnt hold sway over reality in no discussion of science would i ever feel the need to explain what portion of scientists accept an explanation for observed phenomenon in fact youre really signalling a weakness if you need to appeal to consensus secondly and this is not something i believe in personally a practical adjustment could be to focus less on predictions and discuss the history and current state of climatology there are no other areas of childhood education where we openly predict the future math no literature no even in general science discussions we learn about physics and biology and where our knowledge of these topics come from but we dont speculate about what future knowledge of the higgs mechanism offers us in fact if teachers started explaining that the discovery of the higgs means that the standard model of particle physics is wrong and we need to stop worrying about energy sources because we just need to discover the supersymmetric neutrino partner to alleviate all of our energy concerns or whatever fuck i dont know we would immediately recognize this as something akin to brainwashing even is of article physicists agreed that the supersymmetric neutrino partner is a source of limitless free energy wed recognize this as an odd thing to force into the minds of children that dont understand particle physics remember we dont teach advanced particle physics or climatology in schools what hope could these kids have of integrating this knowledge with no backbone to build on every time someone defends teaching kids about anthropogenic climate change replace that phrase with supersymmetric neutrino device and see if your opinion on the matter is less clear

nottheonion,removed,i am not familiar with it as im not american and dont give a shit about the us constitution lol so youre addressing us law when you admit you dont have any fucking clues about us law if thats your standard then i can see why youd support trump he shares your ignorance when hillary does the same by bringing illegal immigrants to speak at her convention as per your selfadmitted ignorance of us law its no surprise youd think that would be illegal it isnt unless she paid them to appear believe it or not it can actually be legal to be an illegal immigrant and there are no laws for knowingly associating illegal immigrants or allowing the to speak i dont know what backwards country you come from but in the us immigrants actually have the right to speak however youre not just mistaken regarding the legal issues youre just full of shit i assume youre referring to karla ortiz whose parents are undocumented im not sure if youre familiar with where babies come from but suffice it say that they come from other people

nottheonion,removed,tldr horrifically racist tobacco companies they gave out packs for free in housing projects and exploited internalized racism such as this from a memo negroes as the story goes are said to be possessed by an almost genetic body odor now whether or not this is real is irrelevant more importantly negroes recognize the existence of this myth and they realize that whitey does too now what does this have to do with menthol cigarettes heres the theory negroes americans smoke menthols to make their breath feel fresh to mask this realmythical odor more info below great article
nottheonion,removed,nobody is going to make their own tobacco but menthol cigarettes will still continue to be produced in every other country that produces cigarettes and they will be smuggled in and still bought by people at higher prices kind of like drugs and other illegal things that people cant produce on their own banning things is not a good way to keep them out of peoples hands lifelong education and social support is the only way to get people to stop hurting themselves with these types of things

nottheonion,removed,someone who doesnt understand how proportion works
nottheonion,removed,id say its a hell of a lot more complicated than that yes a lot of black men kill other black men typically because they are involved with drugs and gangs but the reason they get involved is usually due to a lack of opportunities role models and poverty which can be traced back to unfair treatment by whites in canada first nations people are much more likely to be murdered and to be drug addicts but thats because white people really fucked with them and the effects of that have rippled down if you live on a reservation with drug addicted parents and no positive role models its a lot harder to succeed i think a lot of the stuff the blm movement is doing is not helpful to their cause and a lot of black people in the movement are racist towards white people but that doesnt mean there isnt a serious problem with race in america and with white privilege
nottheonion,removed,the article says she made it trying to make an old bf jealous so she sent it to him she deserved to die if she was that upset about it who fucking makes a sex tape sends it out then gets sad its went viral
nottheonion,removed,im not the person who called you selfentitled but you didnt really give any information on why you believe your first statement so while what isnt very clear either it isnt a leap to recognize that they wanted you to give that information also i think youre a troll or uneducatedconfused though that would require a more complicated explanation

nottheonion,removed,do you have any stories you can share about particular meetings experiences that stood out with you conversations that stuck with you for a long time specific things they did that really left you feeling impressed how did they demonstrate their care and concern for their people how were decisions made how do their people treat them and respond to them im genuinely interested in hearing about this and i feel you probably have a lot that could be said just gonna leave that quoted up there so i can answer one by one i will try and be as gramatically correct as possible but i just wanna write and not worry as much about that so please excuse that stuff experiences that stood out with you conversations that stuck with you for a long time specific things they did that really left you feeling impressed the entire trip was a series of incredible and impactful experiences i would have to say every cheif meeting and every elder meeting was memorable for the most part when meeting with the cheifs and elders you had to go through a whole respect ceremony respect is very important in their culture it is all about heirarchy and respect that is how it functions but whenever going to meet we always had to go through a series of pleasantires bowing down and saying certain things in the local language dagbani and also eating something called a cola nut cola nuts are very very bitter and caffinated nuts you take bites of them and eat them when coming from the outside world to meet with elders and chiefs as a sign of respect so before meeting with any elders or cheifs mostly when we first came in the beginning of the trip we would have to eat these nuts they are soo bitter and nasty but you have to act like they are good honestly by the end they were not too terrible and i would snack on them haha but as far as what impressed me i would have to say the pace at which the conversations and dialogue happened as well as the community focus around the conversations here in the usa if you want a meeting it is very quick and detail oriented it is the complete opposite of a ghanian tribal meeting the meetings would take easily hour to discuss certain things because life is just a different pace there is much more silence and contimplation that goes on at first it was uncomfortable but then you learn to feel the pace and it is much more intune with a natural feeling you may come in to discuss how the walls of the center are being constructed and end up having an hour long meeting and discussing life ideologies and principals additionally the cheif of our village abudu was years old and fairly well educated so that stood out to me as well he was the only chief our organization worked with that spoke english and so that was nice to be able to converse with him a little bit despite his english not being perfect the chief in particular was the person that stood out the most to me though people would frequently come to him for advice and help with tons of different stuff and he would stop to speak with them about what the need and then they would be on their way everything from disputes to medical issues and advice etc how did the demonstrate care and concern for their people as a whole there was a clear pattern of taking care of the old and youngsick etc also women were fairly well respected too our center is actually being run by women who were chosen by the villagers but what stood out to me was how everyone in the community had a say in the decisions we went there to build a solar center but we had to speak with everyone in the community and talk about if they would accept out project and then they discussed it among themselves they see the community and its people as being a collective and not just individuals at our first cheif meeting the cheif actually told us i love this idea but this is not for me to decide you must speak with the elders and villagers tomorrow i will arrange a meeting so there was a clear focus on what was best for the community and it was demonstrated through those actions in my opinion there were also a few times where women were given preferred treatment eating first being given foodwater first running the business having a say in where the center was located going to school etc that showed me personally that they have respect for their women and their men which is a good indicator of how they are doing in a social justice sense how were decisions made i feel the above answer talked about this a lot as well but just to highlight again i would say the fact that the community as a whole had decision making power is what stood out to me there was one point though we were explaining to the kids and asking their opinion of what was going on then our translator did not translate i was like hey amin why are you not translating that and he just laughed and was like you are talking to children they are not like that here they are just kids and if you talk to them it is just to play there is not point in asking their opinion amin was a great guy too so i thought it was interesting the reason i tell this story is i think that was the only group that really had no say in anything the children some of the kids went to school in the village but a lot did not i always wonder what happens to most of the kids that were not in schooli fear they have not the best outcomes after they are older how do their people treat them and respond to them for the most part they are very well reverred they are not religious gods or anything but are certainly highly respected i never asked but i would say on the extreme end they would have the power to put someone to death for a crime or at the very least shun them from the community but for the most part that is not their role the role of the chief is to be a shepard to the people he is meant to have a bunch of elders below him who are all well respected any time a decision needs to be made he consults with the elders who in turn consults with the rest of the villagetribe villagers can come to him for a so there is a degree of accessability while at the same time most of the chiefs live in a palace of some sort palace is the right word but not what you think definately nicer than the other home compounds but still not a typical palace of what most people would imagine so they have a degree of seperation and quality of life benefits but they are not above the people they are just very well respected elders of the community their decendants also share that glory so if they are a good leader their son prince or daugher princess will feel the benefits as a whole the community was very talented in what they did building farming surviving they all collectively work together and the elders are just very intelligent and respected members of the community exceptions to this rule exist but for the most part that is how their society functions on these hierarchal systems

nottheonion,removed,i think most of the answers derive from my first assertion even what that entails is debatable does it change the situation if the product is addictive no provided the user is aware of the risks does it change the situation if the health risk is statistically shown to affect others surrounding the user this suggests there should be restrictions on where the product is used like we have today does it change the situation when someone is profiting from the selfharm no provided they arent restricting the users knowledge about the product does it change the situation when other people public or private will be required to take on the cost of that selfharm in the general case these costs ought to be covered by increases taxes on the product in this specific case its not clear that smoking increases at all due to the users shortened lifespan

nottheonion,removed,the supreme court its what its all about our country is so so its just so imperative that we have the right justices something happened recently where justice ginsburg made some very very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people many many millions of people that i represent and she was forced to apologize and apologize she did but these were statements that should never ever have been made we need a supreme court that in my opinion is going to uphold the second amendment and all amendments but the second amendment which is under absolute siege i believe if my opponent should win this race which i truly dont think will happen we will have a second amendment which will be a very very small replica of what it is right now but i feel that its absolutely important that we uphold because of the fact that it is under such trauma i feel that the justices that i am going to appoint and ive named of them the justices that im going to appoint will be prolife they will have a conservative bent they will be protecting the second amendment they are great scholars in all cases and theyre people of tremendous respect they will interpret the constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted and i believe thats very very important i dont think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear its all about the constitution of of and so important the constitution the way it was meant to be and those are the people that i will appoint donald j trump

nottheonion,removed,you mean this reality we werent fighting the militaries of iraq and afghanistan jesus christ dude are you legitimately suggesting they defeated us lofuckingl are you remotely familiar with how much of the vast majority of the military would defect if asked to turn on its own american citizens historically not enough i know this is your favorite pet fantasy but it is both historically unsound and also implies that the military would not just send california soldiers to texas and texas soldiers to california assuming they sent soldiers at all which in they wouldnt fucking need to guess you missed the invention of the drone are you remotely familiar with what a hundred million gun owners could do to the minimal remaining military police and mercenaries wouldnt be minimal we have so many unmanned military tools that we could wipe the gunowners off the face of the earth with a few guys behind computers and what do tell would you have everyone do instead even if you do wrongly believe american gun owners wouldnt be a force to be reckoned with just bend over and take it no you would die because that would be your only option and that is what would happen period you stand no chance so your argument is that our daytoday lives need to be in constant danger from the multipledaily mass shootings in this country all so you can be placated by something as effective at protecting you as a childs blankie

nottheonion,removed,here we go the reddit armchair experts are out in full force again first off to im going to guess that despite your claims mass spraying doesnt actually make the issue worse if spraying didnt reduce mosquito count governments wouldnt waste the money local governments have limited budgets and lots of demands for services and to you satanicginger the product is not supposed to be used more than two hours after sunrise or two hours before sunset a recommendation that dorchester county administrator jason ward says the county followed sounds like they followed manufacturer recommendations on spraying time seems reasonable to me

nottheonion,removed,do people not realize that its already up to the states pursuant to usc § does not apply to the possession of a firearm— ii if the individual possessing the firearm is licensed to do so by the state in which the school zone is located or a political subdivision of the state and the law of the state or political subdivision requires that before an individual obtains such a license the law enforcement authorities of the state or political subdivision verify that the individual is qualified under law to receive the license to carry on school grounds you have to live in a state that has a permitting process with a background check and no other local laws lower than the federal level which say you cant carry on school grounds i carry a gun on school grounds several times every week completely legally

nottheonion,removed,just need a bigger gun ive heard you need a or lc to take one down
nottheonion,removed,god help the world that you reproduced
nottheonion,removed,the point is the us has such a large and diverse population spread over a huge country that different areas of the country may as well be separate countries themselves also keep in mind the sheer number of firearms owned by citizens somewhere around million and how comparatively low the gun death rate is somewhere around we actually do a really good job of keeping violence low the biggest reason for this is people just dont want to kill each other as much as were led to believe the point im making is that with this many guns and this many people the fearmongering would have you believe that the blood should be running in the streets it just isnt believe it or not you can have widespread gun ownership and not have mass mayhem and wanton destruction guns dont automatically equal death and crime there are social and economic reasons for them that come way before access to guns is an issue

nottheonion,removed,for it to work there needs to be no guns within the national border not just within one state or city good luck with that ok then we should ban guns everywhere especially since in almost every other nation national gun bans have been effective from japan to britain to australia a national ban has worked but regardless gun bans have worked in cities firstly chicago is a unique exception its mostly bc the surrounding countiesareas have weak gun control regulations also even if places with gun bans have large amounts of violence lifting these bans would just make it worse its empirically proven that selfdefense with handguns is not effective
nottheonion,removed,fine whatever keep your guns you hick
nottheonion,removed,it would be equally stupid to think that you need a gun to protect your children from animals at a zoo but then we all remember harambe no you might convince yourself that you dont need a gun to protect yourself or your family but its only because the rest of us are smart enough to bring a gun and kind enough to save your bitch ass pretending that life isnt a survival game is simply stupid a gun is a tool that you can use to defend yourself from other living creatures that seek to do you harm if we sold force fields that could stop other living creatures from harming you by putting you in a safe bubble would you really say you didnt need to have it with you i mean what reason would there be to not have it
nottheonion,removed,liberals arent even really liberals theyre collectivist authoritarians but that doesnt sound as nice
nottheonion,removed,im not entirely sure of how standing rock was mapped out i would think the police would have some sort of protocol but i could be wrong i doubt there was a lot of road traffic like there would be in a city where this law would be more applicable not sure about the dallas ambulance but im sure it had to slow down as opposed to the speed it would be able to operate at had no one been in the road nice mlk strawman blacks have same rights as every other race in america blm is just arguing about some minor details this isnt about one group of protesters or another anyway no protester no matter how justified their protest is should be able to impede traffic
nottheonion,removed,choose one bear pussy or bare pussy
nottheonion,removed,it seems like the whole story here is that a republican cabinet wants to take power away from the federal government and leave it in the individual states hands which is almost always the direction republicans move things in cnn is taking this information and almost spinning it like were looking at a situation where if gun policy in schools is left to the states than the outcome will be pro school shooting or something kind of fucking retarded gun policy in schools will likely be almost identical to what it is now no matter who the fuck chooses

nottheonion,removed,poor pepe looks like he got in the way of the clintons of course the clintons are attacking trumps social icons as a way to undermine his popularity with the millennials clinton is desperate for those millennials and its almost comical that they would go after a cartoon frog you should see the clinton website on pepe lol but what isnt funny is the clintons are known for doing this to real people the clintons have used character assassination against their enemies for decades now they have a man named sid blumenthal that does most of their dirty work alot of people on reddit love christopher hitchens but most people dont know he despised the clintons once he found out the truth about them hitchens and blumenthal used to know each other and one day blumenthal slipped up and told hitchens he was behind the false stories that were released by the press that monica lewinsky was a stalker the more hitchens looked into it the more he saw that the clintons had done this to many women more and more people spoke about the clintons destroying the women bill clinton would sleaze on hitchens spoke out against the clintons for the rest of his life in the clintons had blumenthal use the same tactics to destroy their main opponent in the presidential campaigns which was now president obama the nasty rumors about obamas birth place and him being a muslim along with the photograph of obama in eastern clothing were released by the clintons through blumenthal the proclinton press is quick to tell us that hillary didnt start the birther movement but all it takes is a little digging and anyone with a computer can plainly see that the clintons were behind it there are journalists that remember blumenthal telling them to investigate where obama was born and in fact there are articles that show obama had blumenthal specifically banned from the state department over the rumors when he and the clintons worked out the deal for hillary to be secretary of state who knows what leverage the clintons had of course that didnt stop the clintons from keeping blumenthal on the payroll as proven by the email leaks he advised hillary with classified information in regards to libya even though hillary lied about his role during that time the emails prove he was telling hillary where qaddafi was last seen where the libyan gold reserves were last seen before they disappeared blumenthal even told hillary to blame the deaths of our embassy staff on the man who made the youtube video another little detail alot people dont know is that the clintons were paying blumenthal a month with clinton foundation money during this time cronyism augmented with a slush fund anytime you hear stories that are specifically designed to attack trumps character you can bet its the clintons releasing these attacks through their surrogates in the pro clinton corporate press since their loss to obama in theyve steadily increased their collusion with some of our most powerful corporate media sites the people who own cnn time warner have funded hillary clinton for years and in fact are some of her top donors when bernie supporters called cnn the clinton news network they knew what they were talking about msnbc nbc is another corporate media site that pays for access to the clintons when lester argued with trump over terry tops or when lester talked about hillary being the first female candidate and then asked trump about his sexism it was a classic clinton attack through their corporate press mouthpiece nbc and the clintons started their big money relationship in the years after the election nbc paid chelsea clinton a year for doing nothing other than providing access to the clintons as they secure more and more power another site you see on reddit rpolitics all the time is the daily beast they have a long relationship with the blumenthals and actually pay chelsea clinton hundreds of thousands a year and actually put her on the board of directors sound insane sound like a conspiracy theory no way this could happen in america cnnhbotime warner funds hillary nbc pays for access now a price tag has been hung on that scandal with politicos reporting that clinton has been paid a salary of disclosure raises the obvious question of nbcs goal in giving a person without any measurable journalistic or broadcasting experience or any particular public following a highprofile job and apparently paying her a topechelon salary the answer is equally obvious plainly it was done to curry favor with the clinton family iacs board of directors consists of the following members chelsea clinton director httpsenwikipediaorgwikiiaccompany propaganda in itself is an incredibly powerful tool and when you combine it with people who actually participate in the public reaction to it like ctr does then you have a force so acidic and toxic to democracy one has to wonder the consequences it will have for our future as a matter of fact they increased their spending to million money being exchanged between our politicians and our corporate media so they can use propaganda and character assassination on clintons political opponents is completely unacceptable the clintons have no fucking business anywhere near our white house they were in the white house already for years the senate for years secretary of state for years and now another years in the white house with their thumb on the corporate media no fucking way thats too much power too much corruption thats oligarchy in its purest definition
nottheonion,removed,yeah but regardless whether pepe himself is a racist symbol or intended that way hes definitely being used as a tongueincheek trolly racist mascot by many a bit like the confederate flag by itself doesnt represent anything malicious but has still become associated with the far right because it is often displayed to highlight the positive aspects of that perspective
nottheonion,removed,because this has created a new meta the pepe market will bounce back also forcing a cultural limit on the supply may affect the demand

nottheonion,removed,even if the adl is wrong about the origin of the rare pepe meme that doesnt mean that they view the idea of them being rare as something serious wouldnt you agree no their being wrong does not but their statement isnt just wrong as i have already explained their wording suggests that the rarity of pepes is an actual phenomenon not my reading comprehension skills did you just want to throw in an insult without regarding whether it responds to reality in any way or form go reread your first comment

nottheonion,removed,i doubt theyre coming out at all rather theyre probably just being enabled to behave a certain way by social media and a culture that doesnt just want us to accept a minority demographic like the trans community but represent them in a way that paints their lifestyle as normal because calling it anything but normal is tantamount to prejudice apparently we know for a fact that media has great influence over people especially children so it shouldnt come as a surprise that suddenly we have an influx of kids wanting to play dress up their minds have been saturated in the concept and now they have no choice but to behave like its normal and if their parents try to say otherwise well then according to the our society they are close minded traditionalist bigots when there is a spike in young children wanting to be the opposite sex i think its fairly obvious that this overtly liberal agenda the media seems to enable has gone too far

nottheonion,removed,yeah but they do make you talk about it and think if it deserves or not the title of art and the fact that somebody pays millions for a garbage bin makes you think what this world is thinking
nottheonion,removed,i dont know maybe it is there are many today who can recreate the old masters technique but their paintings dont sell for millions or even thousands of dollars and then you find people who exhibit junkyard scrap and sell them for a fortune maybe the second type reflects todays society more realistically

nottheonion,removed,this this is golden
nottheonion,removed,the eternal irony of feminism
nottheonion,removed,if her man had washed the damned clothes like he was supposed to she wouldnt have had to wear that shirt
nottheonion,removed,uhhh literally according to feminists only white people can be racist because were all powerful and exploit other races through racism and power because were better thats according to feminists of course and ive met feminists who used the same line of thinking for dv as well since men hold the power any abuse is really just defense
nottheonion,removed,the backside of her shirt probably says against women this type of person thinks domestic violence against men is perfectly fine
nottheonion,removed,correct
nottheonion,removed,haha i do not hang out with feminists and will never
nottheonion,removed,that would only be ok if the guy had been beating her up but it doesnt say that in the article that goes to show a lot of people really dont care whats written on their shirts pet peeve of mine
nottheonion,removed,i want to upvote this more what a good question
nottheonion,removed,ill try to sidestep the feminism v red pill war going on here and focus on the gun if you own one please come to an agreement with your significant other that you will secure it away before arguing over anything just a simple rule we need to talk secure your weapon for the time being
nottheonion,removed,everything incorrect that involves race isnt racist racism involves superiority inferiority andor hate attributed to race alone in this instance she isnt being racist shes just wrong she cant just change the definition of racism imo she would be right in saying that racism against minorities is much more harmful than racism against the majority
nottheonion,removed,the comments in this thread are fucking awful
nottheonion,removed,a cry for help why didnt you stop her sooner this is as much your fault as hers
nottheonion,removed,they redifined the words a bit what youre describing is bigotry racism requires systemic power and prejudiced is just thoughts without acting on them
nottheonion,removed,isnt it funny how women scream about equality then pull this shit all they want is a doublestandard
nottheonion,removed,sociology is a joke of loose definitions that change constantly and barely supported studies that are easy to fudge the numbers of dont beat yourself up about it
nottheonion,removed,lol exactly its like my entire experience being around feminists is just a myth or something because reddit sure seems to think feminists are fucking satan
nottheonion,removed,the argument that racismsexism power plus prejudice is ridiculous and something feminists invented to excuse their own racist and sexist views and actions
nottheonion,removed,nobody is going to talk about how shes only getting a year charge for what is essentially attempted murder
nottheonion,removed,the best way to stop domestic violence is to slap it upside the head until it cries
nottheonion,removed,met plenty of them its a thing
nottheonion,removed,cant wait to see the feminists defend this one
nottheonion,removed,prejudice against an individual or group should be recognized as toxic some groups deserve prejudice
nottheonion,removed,yeah i understand what you mean i was originally responding to the racism prejudice power argument the word power can be loosely defined i think
nottheonion,removed,christ how am i not shocked this is about half an hour from where i live
nottheonion,removed,is that literally everything you ever say its at least the third time i see you posting that in this thread alone
nottheonion,removed,well like anything blank is blank plus power where power is defined as something the minority in question doesnt have when it comes to men and women women are defined as a minority
nottheonion,removed,my privilege in the real world isnt going to help me in that situation but it helps you in of other situations where you spend the majority of your lives in also feeling outnumbered on the bus doesnt equate to hardship dude
nottheonion,removed,but it was over his alleged infidelity so he deserved it instead of her just leaving him and finding another man she should just shoot like a mad woman and not worry about a stray bullet killing a kid or anything
nottheonion,removed,feminism do as i say not as i do
nottheonion,removed,who needs the environment right not like anyone uses it for anything theres no jobs there what a waste environment is fine last i checked humanity was larger than it ever has been renewable sources cannot sustain an endless population either we advance and move beyond earth or we die end of story wind power is inefficient solar isnt anywhere near enough are you going to start instituting chinas one child policy next those pesky man made natural disasters right no way to stop them seeing how its natural and not man made dont you need to go fuck a seagull or something how many people do you want to put out of a job precisely sorry i was going to feed my family tonight but usheefareal is up their own ass about these retarded seagulls

nottheonion,removed,this has repeatedly been debunked stop spreading retardation
nottheonion,removed,the big black scary gun thing is a clap back to people wanting to ban because they look like military grade weapons even though they clearly are not once again can you name any nra talking points ive been parroting do they even have talking points considering they have many magnitudes of order less money to work with than the anti gun campaigns i cant imagine they would why are you so afraid of guns are you european or something
nottheonion,removed,no its not as important as a murder its called priority police have a lot of more important things to do than look for your xbox typical spoild brat you are
nottheonion,removed,why are you people so ignorant i hate unintelligent people
nottheonion,removed,for the son of god you sure are a song of a whhooooaaaaaaahhhhh
nottheonion,removed,cant wait to see the part where he takes the cal and mows down the legion
nottheonion,removed,animals arent people if i choose to have a sexual relationship with my dog which i have on the past its up to me to determine if it is harming or discomforting her which it hasnt in my experience she just wants the treat lol
nottheonion,removed,g m j confirmed
nottheonion,removed,quality troll work
nottheonion,removed,people think dubai is cool it isnt neither are muslims eat a fat dick covered in bacon you tryhard fucks your god is a lie
nottheonion,removed,not really
nottheonion,removed,on a scale of to modern theyre a iron age group of monkeys with epic amounts of money
nottheonion,removed,because shes not arab no one will doubt her here in reddit arabs are always guilty in the whole history of qatar there was never a drugged and raped case it simply never happened but when that notarab lass says it happened to her then it must be true its not logic its about you vs us
nottheonion,removed,yeah because all muslims are shitheads with medieval valuesnot
nottheonion,removed,their government and people are dominated by men adhering to a out dated misogynistic belief system that places little value in women not sure why anyone would ever vacation to a muslim countryfuck those crazy people i hope the dutch send in special forces and free her
nottheonion,removed,not to mention the netherlands is importing the middle east you dont have to go to the middle east to be raped anymore in communist europe we bring rape to you
nottheonion,removed,they havent been exterminated yet
nottheonion,removed,juste de la merde ce putain de pays vivement que les usa les rasent
nottheonion,removed,fuck them fuck their backwards ass country and fuck their bullshit religion
nottheonion,removed,good and this should be done in nonnude establishments as well
nottheonion,removed,you mean the mods how is this not absurd nottheonion materialsmh
nottheonion,removed,hows the weather
nottheonion,removed,everything was loose in bike boxes when i was a package handler how did you know everything was lose if you didnt open them if true thats fucking stupid of them
nottheonion,removed,yes but it doesnt necessarily mean the entire thing was lose could just be part of it
nottheonion,removed,why would you repost this jesus
nottheonion,removed,i work for ups the sheer volume of packages that we have to individually handle and load onto a plane can be in the thousands per night many of those packages are marked fragile many other packages are marked heavy lbs some are marked with both we are expected to load our planes before a certain time each night some nights we are unexpectedly given an additional extra packages for us to not only lift and load that many packages but also organize them semineatly on the plane space is important and give extra love to the delicate packages would simply take too much time we wont drop kick your package but we cant treat it like a soap bubble i expect its cheaper for them to replace whatever does get damaged than to lose significant profit when businesses are expecting timely delivery not even human tissueorgans or live critters like fish or reptiles get special treatment this side up will get you nowhere fragile will get you nowhere if it is delicate put it in a sturdy box of appropriate size and bubble wrap the contents thoroughly we had computer monitors shipped in boxes times too large once the shifting weight and uneven support by the product beat the box to a pulp until it was falling apart in our hands tldr we get paid too little to do too much too quickly to treat packages nicely
nottheonion,removed,
nottheonion,removed,i guess they dont teach about censorship in school anymore
nottheonion,removed,because they punish whistleblowers
nottheonion,removed,not really first of all a school administrator punished her in the first place second of all i qualified my admonishment by saying most learn to comprehend what you read ass
nottheonion,removed,i see the school system is taking the rpolitics mods approach to handling things that they dont like
nottheonion,removed,hes white hes mentally ill not a terrorist
nottheonion,removed,ive seen first hand the effects of applause on a child with autism or other spectrum disorders they fit and scream and hit themselves over it honestly though they should probably be segregated during assemblies since they dont understand whats going on anyway instead of changing how other children interact with each other
nottheonion,removed,did you seriously not read the story do you not know the context of what happened to this woman where she was she was at a reserved hotel that she had already paid for that was part of a package deal she was in a foreign country with no transportation where she did not speak the language she likely didnt find out about the key situation until after dark might not have had sufficient local currency to pay for another hotel if she was able to even find one and get safe transit there im sure she did research on it and im sure the research didnt say you might get raped here youre fucking stupid
nottheonion,removed,stop sending your kids to these government propaganda indoctrination factories theyre just rubbing elbows with the offspring of plebs and learning to think like everyone elsebeing exposed to weakminded loser crap like this antiapplause nonsense its a waste of their time
nottheonion,removed,please stop the insanity
nottheonion,removed,in rural parts of the soviet union in the late the government introduced clapping as a way to demonstrate unity and support of the partys agenda especially the collectivization that resulted in the death of up to ten million people in ukraine and the central asian soviet republics if you didnt clap at a party meeting they sent you to a gulag in order to experience torture starvation disease and eventually death
nottheonion,removed,sad to realize that politically correct stupidity has leaked so far out of the us on behalf of normal americans i apologize to the rest of the world
nottheonion,removed,i feel like some people didnt actually read the article this practice was implemented due to the fact that loud noises have an adverse affect on some students im guessing those that have autism as some others have commented here saying that these children should be segregated and shouldnt have their needs prioritised over the needs of the other students i think that is bs this practice only seems to be in place during assemblies where children with special needs are not segregated from the other children it says nothing about stopping them from cheering in class or at other times is it political correctness gone mad to be mindful of other people these days
nottheonion,removed,clapping triggers mee
nottheonion,removed,mhm i was going to point out that was a pretty backhanded remark
nottheonion,removed,rtumblrinaction
nottheonion,removed,are we really this fucking pathetic
nottheonion,removed,why are kids clapping anyway it is a way to control people and should be banned
nottheonion,removed,hint starts with an n
nottheonion,removed,maybe people who are afraid of offending people with noise or personal contact shouldnt have kids or does that statement offend the crowd that sexually identifies as children
nottheonion,removed,the ones that are gonna throw fits arent going to be the ones who dont understand whats going on

nottheonion,removed,hyderabad boys burn puppies alive post video on facebook
nottheonion,removed,if theyre having fits from clapping they wont be understanding whats going on he didnt generalize autism spectrum disorders he generalized the ones who have it bad enough they cant function after they hear clapping but i doubt reading the previous sentence for context would have kept you from getting triggered

nottheonion,removed,those changes are simple and easy ones that can have a big impact its a matter of courtesy someone fighting against that after having it pointed out is merely indicating that they view trans people as unworthy of basic respect what impact is there to anyone not transgendered for switching out terms like girls for terms like everyone nothing whatsoever and yes its a serious matter for trans people i think you dismissing them as over sensitive though is pretty disrespectful do you realise that out of every trans people have attempted suicide yet you phrase it as a tantrum rather than something serious its a pretty disgusting approach to be honest with a significant disregard for other people
nottheonion,removed,this is fucking retarded

nottheonion,removed,ive been following sadiq khan pretty closely and ive also paid a lot of attention to this recent ban that hes imposed now keep in mind the idea of what promoting an unhealthy body image is is definitely subjective however khan is not mindlessly suppressing all ads that feature anyone below a size first and foremost how often do we even see someone above a size in an advertisement for coke or a blender at least in my experience its pretty rare this ad in the london tube for instance features a woman who is most definitely a size or less while you might disagree that ads like this promote an unhealthy body image about

nottheonion,removed,nah suck my dick then go fuck yourself
nottheonion,removed,im sorry but nobody in this comments section really knows what theyre talking about the president is the highest ranking man in the us military thats why hes called the commander in chief every military base has a picture wall with all the higher ranking leaders of each branch and the presidents picture is always sitting at the top with the title commander in chief
nottheonion,removed,checkmate republifats
nottheonion,removed,so it should instead be based on the idea that if one bad person exist you should keep everyone out of your country your whole country is based on immigration are you fucking retarded or something you are an immigrant yourself you dense motherfucker just because you got there a little earlier doesnt mean you own the place racist piece of shit
nottheonion,removed,how did they rig the election also the democrats have the backing of illegal immigrant votes
nottheonion,removed,is there a hilarious wiki edits subreddit if not we should make one make the rules include not actually saving the edit but just getting a screenshot quick to post shitpost heaven for sure but the cream rises to the top and id scroll that stoned for laughs
nottheonion,removed,he has an ma from georgetown a mba from harvard and he is also a former us navy officer who worked at the pentagon for the cno but you probably know him as that racist from brett art keep getting spoon fed your news you fucking moron
nottheonion,removed,uhhuh and i speculate that you enjoy fucking small children
nottheonion,removed,man i really hope they assassinate him soon
nottheonion,removed,fyi hes a trumptard troll account hours old does nothing but post every second defending the objectively idiotic things trump says and does ect
nottheonion,removed,funny you left setting idiots thrive on appeal to authority now because it doesnt support your narrative it doesnt apply hypocrite much
nottheonion,removed,nonsense this is the america we want jobs no tpp proper vetting of refugees legal immigration a nation without borders is not a nation the left are the ones burning cars to the ground and attacking people in airports
nottheonion,removed,did you hurt yourself you are probably just trolling but by this argument all of humanity should be wiped out because no civilization is bloodless
nottheonion,removed,its sad you cant have a conversation without resorting to ad hominem attacks
nottheonion,removed,logic is a liberal conspiracy for sheeple
nottheonion,removed,president trump is the best president weve ever had without president trump we would not be able to enjoy the prosperity and freedoms that we have he has given us so much and he has sacrificed so much that we as americans should be and must be grateful the citizens must work hard to achieve the common goal of the american worker it is through hard work and determination at the american worker will be successful and through the leadership through the great and supreme president trump the united states of america will be prosperous for centuries to come all hail president trump our leader our compass and our eternal father sent with present to past technology time of transmission
nottheonion,removed,you can thank trump and his fascist party for all the violence that is to come from now on i think anyone that shows up to a protest with a maga hat one deserves to get the shit beat out of them for still supporting pure hate and bigotry think of the red hat like the red band nazis wore i think they are mimicking them on purpose anyways
nottheonion,removed,you clearly arent reading what im writing thank you for ruining the conversation further
nottheonion,removed,again you are making absolutely no sense stop speaking like a child and finish a thought
nottheonion,removed,please trump do no grab merkel by the pussy i know you could get that ass dog but let this one go
nottheonion,removed,a month old child got denied entry because of his dual citizenship he was months old now list the children that this toddler raped thats not an argument no one is suggesting every one of these people are guilty of rape what an idiotic strawman unless of immigrants commit rape youre not allowed to keep them out of your country good lord listen to yourself immigration serves the people of a nation and mena immigration has brought nothing but trouble to the west no that doesnt mean toddlers are rapists though the refugees who raped the year old girl in ohio were children it simply means you understand that the group as a whole is not good for the nation or say this president donald j trump is human garbage and anyone who voted for him is complicit in his crimes id rather say this youre a buffoon who created quite possibly the worst strawman i have ever seen in my life stop embarrassing yourself
nottheonion,removed,because germany is doing so well with muslim immigration if you want to stop the dying in the middle east send in your military to kill anyone who dares threaten said military after successful subjugation install a secular government with a basis in democracy that is if you dont wish to make them a territory these people must be treated as children for they know nothing of liberty but when they taste of its fruit they will not want to go back to the hell hole that was the time before
nottheonion,removed,youre not terribly smart are you so far much smarter than you
nottheonion,removed,go troll somewhere else basement beta
nottheonion,removed,hahaha you are the most pathetic troll
nottheonion,removed,did not shop but google it thinking it would have been a more common notion
nottheonion,removed,typical shit tier logic coming for a typical subhuman liberal
nottheonion,removed,careful kid seems trumps dick is so far down your throat its cut the oxygen off to your brain
nottheonion,removed,merkel has no right to explain anything to anyone on immigration she betrayed her country by bringing in savages and the citizens are now the ones to pay for it by rape and violence
nottheonion,removed,tenspeed bikes peddling as fast as we could get some high production value action
nottheonion,removed,merkel is the idiot teacher that lets all the bad kids in her class fuck everything up
nottheonion,removed,look up the rape stats for it and the amount in prison
nottheonion,removed,shes also the teacher that the kids are running rough shot on trumps method might be pretty heavy handed but merkels way led to large scale sexual assaults in cologne etc which outcome is worse
nottheonion,removed,while letting all the ethnic children sexually assault white girls because she doesnt want to come off racist
nottheonion,removed,the refugee convention requires the international community to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds all signatory states are obligated to do the german government explained this policy in their call yesterday am i the only one thinking it is pure idiocy and even folly to think this policy must force governments to take people no matter the security implications i mean at the end of the day governments should have control of immigration not some international law of course refugees should be taken in but governments should have a final discretion about it who criticises japan who took about refugees in total and refuses to take more citing lack of ability to take care of them or major rich arab countries which closed their doors to refugees it seems this singling out of trump administration is political isnt it
nottheonion,removed,now donald listen to me you have to import so many illiterate zealots that women are afraid to leave the house at night for fear of being gangraped that is what we germans call progress also when refugees fire bomb a synagogue dont punish them they only do it because they hate israel are you ready to be president now honey
nottheonion,removed,merkle is the reason why crime rates risen in german due to the migrants being invited in shes the reason why there was over sexual assault reports during new year of she is not a good leader
nottheonion,removed,my friend from germany explains merkel as the stupid bitch who ruined their country he might be biased because he was mugged by a refugee at knife point and the police refused to do anything about it
nottheonion,removed,oh ok that was not what i intended to say there is a definite possibility of refugees becoming part of such areas though of course but thats not a problem really caused by the refugee wave
nottheonion,removed,propaganda this shit is factual and can be researched by anyone with half a brain liberal idiots just listen to the news and reeee
nottheonion,removed,merkel is that teacher at school who lets the kids that rape and murder other kids stay in class anyway to keep the room diverse
nottheonion,removed,a lot of antiimmigration feeling is based on pure lack of empathy if you found yourself suddenly in an arab country with a completely different culture and language would you be able to quickly integrate as a gay white male with tatooed arms im pretty sure i would be murdered in a few days asia and south america are very different than arab countries you cant compare that theres a big big difference between we dont like you very much because youre different and we will stone you because youre gay and we will rape you if you are a women murdering gay people and throwing stones for minor offenses is lack of empathy saying that you dont want your tax money spent to accomodate people of that culture isnt lack of empathy
nottheonion,removed,for people not knowing there is even an organised movement out there created with help of bernie supporters it is called justice democrats and at twitter justicedems
nottheonion,removed,because it is true merkel is not as unpopular as you think she has a an approval rate of percent dissaproval of in contrast to that you can see frauke petry the leader of the afd is at percent with a dissaproval rate of percent
nottheonion,removed,trump you know theyre raping and killing people right merkel ja trump well how do you just let them rape young girls like that merkel easy you just put them within an arms length distance
nottheonion,removed,i mean ive never known a teacher that notices women being raped by crowds of men and then do nothing about it because the rapists happen to be muslim we probably went to very different public schools though
nottheonion,removed,this explanation ignores refugee quotas foreign currency manipulation abd the fact that the us has been the prime financialmilitary supporter of the un since conception with nothing to show for it outside of a bunch of shitty european socialists not having to pay for their own armies using that money to instead build welfare states then criticizing the us for not being a giant welfare state like they are
nottheonion,removed,yeah he went to princeton but im sure he needs a lecture on us history from some community college feminist dance therapy major
nottheonion,removed,and nods approvingly while all the female students get gangraped by knuckledragging morons that burned down their own school

nottheonion,removed,theyre all working for the jesuit popes coadjutors in the global intelligence community run reddit the other major social networking sites true users who swallow their doctrine lock stock barrel are blindly walking into the snare theyve set before you its all theater made for public consumption
nottheonion,removed,except its not really that accurate the un has been considered useless for years now the changes that implemented at the bretton woods conference is doing more harm to the us than good becoming more isolationist is a logical move and if a war breaks out between russia and europe as a result to blame the us is beyond asinine the radical left has been sneering and screaming at the us for being the world police for political points ever since they agreed to it and when they finally take steps to reverse that sentiment and reality they outright lose their collective shit

nottheonion,removed,youre really bad at math at some point youre going to run out of bad regulations and well leave what qualifies as bad for a whole different discussion and you will still need to make new ones what do you do then just start removing two good ones its the wrong tool for the ostensible goal to help small businesses but the correct tool for trump to expand his own businesses dont be silly take your own advice
nottheonion,removed,dont even bother expecting a coherent response these people are fucking chimpanzees who are brainwashed to think drumpf bad no matter what this is probably the most sensible thing hes ordered so far but these fucking idiots are either too stupid to realize it or to brainwashed to think for themselves probably both
nottheonion,removed,rule how is this oniony its one of the things he campaigned on and promised he would do and now hes signed the order its just news thats all
nottheonion,removed,this isnt oniony
nottheonion,removed,you have been watching everything that is going on in the world and have evaluated with precision that they are utter failures ok i think you do not know how the world works and the complexities that govern it you do not know how many conflicts would have already happened if all countries served their protectionist agenda and segregated everyone else and never had a dialogue you think it is so bad that years of your analysis is spot on while years of this buffoons history is not enough to say what his policies are or infact who he is thats plain hypocrisy or you think the world is down to shit with whatever we know so lets try a monkey hell we dont know we cant say maybe he would do the right thing

nottheonion,removed,what do you think my point is seriously reread this thread carefully you are the only one having the argument that you think that you are having ill recap to help you out someone said jokingly that trumps point was exactly equal to one step forward two steps back and it got a bunch of upvotes because thats how reddits leftleaning base will see it someone else pointed out that its not literally that because you cant equate a regulation with a step forward as you point out there are some bad regulations and you cant equate repeal with a step back since as you point out there are some bad regulations that could stand to be repealed in the name of progress you decided that this was an argument that all regulation or at least the majority of it is bad im not sure how you got that from your reading of the subject but i would strongly encourage you to reread that again with a more fair eye your point has literally no validity until you demonstrate the majority of regulations have a net negative value to society no one is arguing that so no one has to prove that i dont care whether this fact is true for this conversation im not sure why you think it matters here the implicit assumption is regulations are made to improve peoples lives and the prosperity of the nation your implicit assumption one that i would generally share but it doesnt really matter because no one is arguing this point obviously not all of them do but to suggest most of them dont is plainly idiotic no one in this comment chain is suggesting that other than the strawman youre raging at its worth noting however that this plainly idiotic suggestion is a core belief of basically the entire rightwing voting population which was the entire point these people dont see it that way if you want to go show some conservitards who is boss go find some youre wordvomiting a bunch of points i agree with at me as though im arguing that point and youre completely missing mine in the process get a grip and read more carefully

nottheonion,removed,oh im sorry my parents could afford to have a child and raise it properly shame the raising part couldnt be said for you because you result to suggesting someone shouldnt have been born because they disagree with you
nottheonion,removed,american women running around having sex with all kinds of men at a young age is the reason baby murder happens on the scale that it does if american women werent whoring around as much as they do then the family unit wouldnt be so broken in this country and societys probs would be drastically reduced
nottheonion,removed,were number were number were number
nottheonion,removed,these redditors are too young and inexperienced in life to have been exposed to the types of problems regulations and bureaucracy create
nottheonion,removed,wait seriously no i mean i get that you guys dont have a lot of protections but are you saying that welfare is your only safety net up here we generally have three common deductions cpp ei and tax cpp is our government pension plan which should speak for itself as should tax ei is sort of like an extra tax we pay which is like an insurance premium based on income you pay this premium out of every pay cheque and if you lose your job through no fault of your own layoffs etc you can get paid a percentage again around for a number of months to help smooth things over until you can find another job is there really nothing like this maybe by another name i mean holy shit
nottheonion,removed,no no no its better to just randomly remove regulations when you create you see its chess manits like maga or something fuck ok i cant even do itthis shit is fucking retarded

nottheonion,removed,there was appearantly a starpheonix article about him in i cant find the original although somebody that wanted to do some research could probably find it the story wasnt caught by the internet archive but according to this httprabblecababblefeminismconvictedchildmolestorrunningschoolboard appearantly this was a quote from the story hall was sentenced to months in jail in july after pleading guilty in regina court of queens bench to two charges of having sexual intercourse with females aged to and two charges of indecent assault of females hall was a schoolteacher at the time of the offences which took place between and in regina swift current and melfort since i dont know his birthdate or the dates of the offenses its hard to give an exact date of how old he was at the time but given he was a teacher he was likely when he started and likely when he stopped so he was a or year old teacher sleeping with a year old they were in a position of authority over im not so sure theyre definitely not a pedophile
nottheonion,removed,have as many wives as you like but the birthrate in nigeria as well as the rest of sub saharan africa should be zero earths population is too high to keep allowing these garbage animals to breed

nottheonion,removed,i looked at your links good work but proof is not there in my eyes nothing is there i bet i could find thousands of people saying that dems lost the house the senate ect because that actually happened but in your claim you found two people who said something yet they didnt type the exact same sentence just the same concept and i am supposed to believe they are the same person just because two people out of millions of users can present the same idea and they must be the same person your evidence literally shows nothing if anybody actually clicks your links and follows the trail you have laid out they see quickly that your claims are false i spent way too much time trying to figure out how the evidence related to what you were pushing do you think that you can just make a post with some links and people will just believe you

nottheonion,removed,not the op but sure why not its like reading about someone who was thrown into a gigantic vat of warm nacho cheese obviously i understand the various problems of being tossed into a vat of cheese and thus i feel badly for the victim however at the same time i stare at all that delicious gooey yelloworange cheese and say to myself damn i dont think i would mind being in his shoes his delicious liquidcheesefilled shoes mmm
nottheonion,removed,if a male teacher spent a year sleeping with a female student would you feel the same way about it if she was it wouldnt be a big deal at all to me professionally it would be the same as any employee sleeping with clients firing someone isnt the same as degrading them for the rest of their lives with a criminal record whats the big deal about this teacher sending a couple dick pics to his student there is no big deal about dick picks every man has a penis half the population has a penis stop being afraid of penis put penis into perspective a man fucks his hand more often than hell ever fuck a woman yet he can shake anyones hand with that same hand touch every public doorknob or railing or pencil or fruit and vegetable or with that same hand he can pull trigger and choke someone to death with that hand but you people are afraid of his penis

nottheonion,removed,so you say all cultures inevitably produce an equal amount of rapists psychopaths doctors etc no i wouldnt assume so immigration is fine when its doctors and lawyers from nigeria or india but when you have unrestricted migration from farmers and laborers who are generally poor uneducated and shitty even in your own country you skew the balance of desperate rapey people
nottheonion,removed,there are too many people in the country full stop we are full
nottheonion,removed,you are incredibly dense
nottheonion,removed,that was somebody else but way to namecheck aaaaaaand it wasnt ignorance on the issues it was simply that fact that i am not an economist i am not privy to the inner workings of trade agreements i cannot go about my day and hold in my head all the ramifications of what it means to be a nation part of the eu and if you say that you can that you do understand all the issues of being in the eu every facet of all the aspects i listed then you are a fool and a liar
nottheonion,removed,either youre a total idiot for believing that or a really terrible troll less than of our population is muslim
nottheonion,removed,really we made the right decision because this a woman who trolls for debates i guess it makes about as much sense as any other reason i heard for leaving
nottheonion,removed,what im english but yes it should matter that people are leaving right now the education sector is in crisis there is not enough teachers and many are leaving the profession my partner is a very highly qualified teachers who speaks languages and has travelled all over the world right now our current government is pushing out academies which give the power to employ unqualified people as teachers they do this while they keep on cutting teachers pay a highly qualified teacher such as my partner is essential for a good school but her pay is awful and the unwelcoming feeling and antiimmigrant pressure and brexit has compounded into a very horrible experience she spent years preparing to be a part of our economy culture and society england cant afford to lose teachers like her i dont understand how you see a benefit of making her feel unwelcome how can it not matter to you
nottheonion,removed,are you is this deep
nottheonion,removed,i like how you assume i value family and that this argument will sway me i value individuals based on their beliefs and actions the proximity of their blood relation to me is meaningless and dont forget all living creatures on earth are part of the same family one huge family tree that contains everything from grass to humans

nottheonion,removed,the amendment did not violate the equal protection aspect of the amendment everyone was treated the same under the eyes of the law no one regardless of race religion sexual orientation sex etc could consume alcohol likewise gay marriage does not violate the amendment either whether you are straight or gay you are both allowed equal protection under the eyes of the law you are both allowed to marry someone of the opposite sex its not a very good analogy anyways because the amendment would be made under the argument of violation of liberty if anything from what i was able to find of judge roberts dissent it sounds like his point is that making decisions about the social realm should not be up to the government or legal system but this ignores the fact that the government already crossed this boundary by taking sides by legally recognizing some marriages and not others just cause the government already did it doesnt mean the government should keep doing it as far as chief justice roberts is concerned whats done is done he cant change the past and neither did he make those laws you have to take into account the time when the decision was made he has to deal with the hand that hes dealt and that means straight marriage only put yourself in chief roberts shoes you either strike down a law as unconstitutional or you do nothing if you strike down a law as unconstitutional then you are making a decision on the social realm if you do nothing then you are not making a decision on the social realm striking down a law sets a precedent while refusing to rule on a law does not by doing nothing chief justice roberts abstained from making a ruling on the social realm by doing nothing he sets no precedents and he has no opinion on social issues

nottheonion,removed,yeah told who gives a fuck its the money from the games thats important anyway you idiots maybe she was an incompetent teammate and it was a joke in poor taste but come on women do belong in the kitchen and men belong in the wild hunting women get filled and birth the babies while men make things happen men women czech are guys who dont take shit from women so itll be interesting to see how this plays out
nottheonion,removed,this isnt oniony this sub is stupid
nottheonion,removed,but thats not what he said he seems to think racism is a crime or something
nottheonion,removed,sooo theyre going to train with the womens team so they can confirm their suspicions about being better than women probably not the most useful response mind you there isnt any good response either way its a thoughtspeech crime
nottheonion,removed,you shouldnt have to tell women that they should know their place already
nottheonion,removed,ya but according to current generation feminism women are weak little flowers that need extra protections and privileges at least thats what i assume their message is
nottheonion,removed,i see women still cant take a joke
nottheonion,removed,its almost as if women dont know how to take a joke
nottheonion,removed,because you see snow flakes cant take a joke nor can they be taunted or be called names because that would be offensive you see one sex is actually more equal than the other because ita the current year dude they do not realize that this behaviour will only make people want to make these jokes more now calm thy tits and go make me a sandwitch

nottheonion,removed,women have no place being in referees in male games anyway

nottheonion,removed,find a less worthless partner
nottheonion,removed,so youd be cool with a company in america saying that all employee were not allowed to voice support for any political party but the republicans

nottheonion,removed,httpsyoutubebjnjqzjg subscribe
nottheonion,removed,hi beautiful video
nottheonion,removed,maybe because they do belong in the kitchen feminism has destroyed the family unit and this world is going to shit because of women
nottheonion,removed,well thats where they belong
nottheonion,removed,like cooking you mean
nottheonion,removed,so your saying it is okay to criticize companies preventing speech yet that is what i started out doing in this very thread and you seemed to oppose it
nottheonion,removed,but if they actually play football or train the men with be better and possibly even more arrogant
nottheonion,removed,typical feminism they demand to be treated just like men then when they are treated just like men they throw a hissy fit and cry about it
nottheonion,removed,get wrecked
nottheonion,removed,hes not wrong women as a group suck at just about everything compared to me except idk child birthing and breast feeding
nottheonion,removed,herehttplmgtfycomqprofessionalwomensvshighschoolboys
nottheonion,removed,like cooking meals in the kitchen you mean
nottheonion,removed,people should be allowed to state their opinion without consequence by a company yes that is my ideal but they cannot avoid facing the consequences of that action as a company is not a government and freedom of speech does not apply to businesses and their employees doesnt apply now id prefer the rich corporate owners not dictate the opinions of their employees why do you prefer it
nottheonion,removed,american women beat this stereotype by sucking at cooking now trololololol
nottheonion,removed,httpiimgurcomnxodkjfjpg
nottheonion,removed,will they be training in the kitchen
nottheonion,removed,why was there a soccer field in the kitchen
nottheonion,removed,i mean that in my ideal world free speech would be a workers right because companies are represented by their employees and it allows the company to take a stance against what their employees may say so hypothetically a company can tell a black man he has to support a racist party and if he is desperate enough he will do it because he has children to feed that just isnt the world i want to live in
nottheonion,removed,its a scientific fact to admit that but its a real dick move to lord it over women and act like youre gender is better if you doubt this happens just keep scrolling
nottheonion,removed,lol they call suppresion free speech codes of conduct now
nottheonion,removed,yea i should totally respect their culture
nottheonion,removed,this is sad an innocent tender human moment happening between two people and the fun police are handy to break it up im very impressed saudi arabia what a beautiful culture you have
nottheonion,removed,meanwhile in saudi arabia
nottheonion,removed,no ones saying he would have to support a racist party if companies can dictate their employees political views this could well be the outcome im putting forward hypothetical to get the point across that workers rights matter and free speech should ideally be part of those rights why is it so hard to ask your employees to be nice and not to participate in hate speech because hate speech is subjective and someone shouldnt have to moderate their speech for your feelings
nottheonion,removed,naaaaaaaaaaaants ingonyama bagiiiiiiiiithi baba
nottheonion,removed,for the love of god make sure you get a spare key from him in case you need to use it also hide a gps device on it and wait for him to abandon it on the side of the road i hear thats what they do
nottheonion,removed,so essentially the working class have no right to free speech at all i mean at a basic level cutting the bullshit out that is what youre saying why do you think this is a good thing then they have every right not to say anything oh wow what a right you are allowing them i guess the people in iran should be thankful they also have this right the right to not say anything you sound like a fascist
nottheonion,removed,youre arguing that people should choose between the ability to make political speech and starving to death due to lack of funds if anything that is worse than a government you must have led a pretty charmed life to think someone can just choose new employment as if on a whim
nottheonion,removed,shit man nobody chooses their life
nottheonion,removed,once again please keep up i am not the one expressing a belief
nottheonion,removed,see liberals this is how strict their culture is but please inform the rest of us unenlightened idiots how bigoted we are for refusing to accept people who dont want you assimilate with our culture
nottheonion,removed,because a lot of people genuinely refuse to see the harm of islamic culture and will in fact pretend there isnt a problem

nottheonion,removed,dont call me a homosexual alright youre clearly a troll and im ashamed i fell for it that long oh and i mean there are people on reddit reading and writing in their second language and they grasp concepts english is my third language
nottheonion,removed,so glad we brought these people over here shouldve left them in the jungle
nottheonion,removed,sounds like some stupid shit only a black person would do
nottheonion,removed,because democrats
nottheonion,removed,and what are those stats based on tickets the statistics are bullshit and its obvious you dont know any black people because they get pulled over all the fucking time the police cant even keep proper statistics on how many people they shoot to death but you think these are infallible lmao
nottheonion,removed,typical deadbeat prob end up on a chalk line like the rest of them
nottheonion,removed,jigs are so desperate to impress i feel sorry for them
nottheonion,removed,that title implies fines are base on whats in your pockets this is stupid shit along with this rappers name along with this culture that allows a garbage rapper with no talent named getty wop to be rich and famous
nottheonion,removed,dwdar
nottheonion,removed,i largely blame rappers for the state of the black community they give their youth bad role models to look up to promote crime create a bad aspiration for youth to become rappers themselves
nottheonion,removed,these are criminal places the staff would like to see you die
nottheonion,removed,but reddit taught me that white males are the truly oppressed ones and everyone else is just whiny
nottheonion,removed,classic jewish american
nottheonion,removed,i dunno sorta believe she should be hung too then again i also do believe that the greater position you hold when you become purposely negligent and incompetent should carry greater weight in terms of punishment
nottheonion,removed,should have offered a facial
nottheonion,removed,the company sounds like a guy in a van with free candy written on it maybe the rapist knew
nottheonion,removed,they dont make sorry you got raped hallmark cards im pretty sure
nottheonion,removed,fits the profile of sex tourism older white females on womens only tour called girls for sails to non white destinations
nottheonion,removed,rapey mcrapeface
nottheonion,removed,there is something really odd about the way this is written i am shocked by a company which claims to empower women by helping them learn to sail without men has treated a rape victim so badly i just i dunno it reminds me a little of mattress girl
nottheonion,removed,fuck you get off our island mumu
nottheonion,removed,lol that is fucking hilarious i hope she took the joke
nottheonion,removed,bet she enjoyed every bit of it rape victims are often nymphos in disguise or frustrated feminists

nottheonion,removed,she was not given a private room this should have been covered before the trip always ask how you accommodations will be provided didnt ask thats stupid she wasnt given keys to her room so her room was unsecured its not safe what part of that did she miss i would not sleep in a room with out locking the door i would demand better accommodations she didnt shes ignorant and naive at what point did she not stop and say oh wait this wont work id like to say that she woke up and got smart while she was being raped nope she doubled down on stupid and did not demand immediate transport home and to a lawyer nope she expects them to fix the problem how effing stupid is this woman you cant fix rape what did she expect they would do kiss it and make it better literally dang vacation went badly demand a flight home and gtfo or stay for a sequel they refunded her money they provided a horrible situation and the money should be returned they didnt provide a secure locked room with a key she was rooming with strangers ill never do that again i worked for a company that provided motel rooms with a coworker woke up one night to a coworker climbing in my bed with me gaf another one spying on me when he said he would be leaving with friends and i had a special guest another stole money from me another used coke and refused to sleep at night or snored like a chainsaw endless hassles so she messed up because she is naive and careless they messed up because they are irresponsible about client safety being stupid and naive doesnt make them not liable they are still liable for what happened to her as the accommodations were not secure and private and were open to intrusion they created the situation that allowed this to happen and did nothing to prevent it the fact that they provided services to her and refunded her money makes them look better beyond that they are under no obligation to provide her with anything but what she requested she cant request damages or punitive penalties she just cant she must file a claim and take them to court failing that she has no recourse the law is the law they didnt rape her they just didnt protect her and provide for a safe experience now if they had done all that and she still got raped are they obligated to help her or give back her money no she could have gotten raped some other way they are certainly not criminally responsible she has a responsibility for her own safety unless she is claiming she is incompetent she certainly seems naive and foolish

nottheonion,not_removed,titles oniony only kids hitting puberty cant look past a title
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah but with the actual onion most of the time the title is the only real funny part and frankly this sounds like a title theyd use regardless of the fact that the article isnt about what it sounds like

nottheonion,not_removed,agreed it aint sexy its jealousy now a gentle lick up the neck and to the ear that is sexy and causes the horny shivers

nottheonion,not_removed,watch out the legos will destroy your feet if you dont have callusses

nottheonion,not_removed,for the nongerman guys there was a huge migration of slugs on a german autobahn and a guy with his trabi old ddrcar slipped on the slime and flipped over police says they had never seen so many slugs at once some of the animals could survive
nottheonion,not_removed,shes said herself she puts her work before her kids she divorced her husband of eight years and met another man immediately stops volunteering and wants to focus on her kids wants to bring man to the uk to marry so he can attain a visa this story is so fucked up
nottheonion,not_removed,they deported a guy from france to holland you dont need a passport to travel between the two countries so how does that even work seems like deporting a guy from california to texas
nottheonion,not_removed,in light of the other articles ive read here about female volunteersworkers hooking up with migrants im starting to feel like the jungle should be a new app its still bizarre to me that workers at the camp are allowed to have relationships with migrants its exploitive i think thats the real story here glossed over as some pseudo found myself story yea makes me sad inside
nottheonion,not_removed,whoa too broad a statement
nottheonion,not_removed,two people are alley cats

nottheonion,not_removed,instant cure for headaches earaches toothaches and runny noses
nottheonion,not_removed,okay so american politicians arent the only ones not trying now
nottheonion,not_removed,yes its so nice of perfecto yasay philippines foreign minster to provide an explanation in behalf of the islamic statelinked abu sayyaf group
nottheonion,not_removed,arrest really does no one think things through anymore no benefit of the doubt
nottheonion,not_removed,definitely not racism the houston school district admits that during the school year about similar cases were reported additionally district officials admit that their records show that all of the students investigated for attempting to pass counterfeit currency were minority students mostly african american or latino
nottheonion,not_removed,fuck that school hope the cops slapped them with misuse of emergency services charge turns out they didnt they didnt even apologize what a bunch of shitbags
nottheonion,not_removed,there are printed after every idiot involved in this should be fired no excuse for this
nottheonion,not_removed,if you go to thomas jeffersons place monticello in virginia they give out bills as change
nottheonion,not_removed,i bought gas at a station in wichita kansas a few years ago paid with a and a left and went about three blocks away when i got pulled over by a cop who asked me if i had just bought gas at that gas station to which i replied yes then he asks me what i paid with and i tell him a and a so he tells me to get out of the car next thing i know im handcuffed in the back of his squad car getting read my rights im being arrested on suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill because the cop tells me everybody knows theres no such thing as a bill to which i reply somebody better tell my bank in my hometown that because thats where i got it anyhow to make a long story short his supervisor and a few others cops show up the cop tells his boss whats going on the supervisors mouth falls open he makes the arresting officer take the handcuffs off me tells me im no longer under arrest that im free to go and that hell explain the concept of bills to his officers and the convenience store clerk now im a white guy but i still have a bit of an european accent not that im saying that had anything to do with any of this editgrammar
nottheonion,not_removed,i was initially surprised neither the educators noe the cops knew about or to check if a bill is real then i read the students first name and it became clear danesiah of course texans would default to assuming a crime was committed
nottheonion,not_removed,id give my ¢ on the issue but i dont want to be arrested
nottheonion,not_removed,dollar bills are suppose to be lucky
nottheonion,not_removed,thursday april
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess it was much for the school
nottheonion,not_removed,in fairness us twodollar bills from account for a vast majority of those in circulation apologies for was from httpiimgurcometirhczjpg so its appearance differed significantly on both the obverse and the reverse many people find the red seal and serial number particularly jarring while not uncommon such banknotes are rarely tendered even redseal fivedollar bills from that period which a cashier is far more likely to encounter often cause confusionsuspicion among persons unaccustomed to the design of course this doesnt remotely excuse the schools ridiculous reaction
nottheonion,not_removed,i love hearing all these youcantfixstupid stories out of texas theyre actually starting to make floriduh look good
nottheonion,not_removed,speaking of how the officer handled the situation joseph continues he brought me my bill back he didnt apologize which brings to realization why cops hate to go to funerals they really hate to say im sorry
nottheonion,not_removed,i loved getting as a kid its so funny our country doesnt remember what is legal tender
nottheonion,not_removed,they went and tracked down where the kid got the money from before they took it to someone who didnt have their racist head up their own ass to verify if it was fake jesus tap dancing christ people are shitty
nottheonion,not_removed,if they really thought it was counterfeit maybe they should ask why a student would need to steal a meal nope lets arrest a child in need of food
nottheonion,not_removed,the bill so old dating back to the schools counterfeit pen didnt work on it i imagine it went a little like this kid presents a note that noone had ever seen before being suspicious of the note the person at the cash register used the standard counterfeit pen on it and being so old it failed the test from there things got out of hand but it does sound like it was more than a case of theres no such thing as a bill you criminal scum
nottheonion,not_removed,we really cant take any chances with this one the potential scale of a counterfeit bill operation could uproot the lunch money economy that middle school bullies depend on
nottheonion,not_removed,we arent trying to be racist or anything but data shows we dont have the same issue with white people
nottheonion,not_removed,how many were counterfeit
nottheonion,not_removed,hope the cops slapped them with misuse of emergency services charge according to the article even the officer was unaware this was legal currency
nottheonion,not_removed,what op doesnt mention is the bill was also over years old so pretty easy to think its counterfeit when even the counterfeit pens show it as counterfeit also the police were likely already at the school often officers assigned to schools and are in school occasionally so was easy to have them come look at it and once that happens they have to follow procedure
nottheonion,not_removed,hell they give you one for free as part of the tour or used to anyway and im sure it was part of the price just sayin
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a good point this student should sue that school district
nottheonion,not_removed,so you accuse people of profiling while profiling an entire state hello pot this is kettle
nottheonion,not_removed,would have been a better link than linking to someones blog about the article but the actual article doesnt have the added spineditorial of ops blog link which doesnt mention that the note failed the standard antiforgery pen test and it doesnt mention a similar story where a student passed off an actual fake note in a similar situation which means people had probably been told to keep an extra eye out for such notes
nottheonion,not_removed,well theyd get square meals a day in prison so maybe the administrations heart is in the right place
nottheonion,not_removed,yup poor criminal lock em up s
nottheonion,not_removed,turns out little sally was running a counterfeit drug ring she runs the entire eastern seaboard
nottheonion,not_removed,i doubt it failed the test as all us currency as of the has used paper that would pass a pen test
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks for the lols
nottheonion,not_removed,zero bills are way too conspicuous compared to bills
nottheonion,not_removed,procedure which in this case involved arresting a middle schooler im pretty sure if the student was white this wouldnt have been an issue
nottheonion,not_removed,from the article district officials admit that their records show that all of the forty students investigated for attempting to pass counterfeit currency were minority students mostly african american or latino
nottheonion,not_removed,well the actual state representatives of education and law enforcement were involved so blaming texas seems appropriate
nottheonion,not_removed,worse yet they initiated the profiling with the name connection and then accused other people of doing it
nottheonion,not_removed,in an interesting aside the houston school district admits that during the school year about forty similar cases were reported additionally district officials admit that their records show that all of the forty students investigated for attempting to pass counterfeit currency were minority students mostly african american or latino guess he doesnt have to profile its pretty much out in the open additionally when you have cities in your state like texas that people tell you to not go there if youre not white then yea you have a problem there
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt this more a secret service matter then school district police
nottheonion,not_removed,just because the paper is made out of the same stuff notes today are it doesnt mean that in its years of usage it hasnt absorbed other things that would make it incorrectly react the counterfeit detector pen is extremely simple it contains an iodine solution that reacts with the starch in woodbased paper to create a black stain when the solution is applied to the fiberbased paper used in real bills no discoloration occurs the pen does nothing but detect bills printed on normal copier paper instead of the fine papers used by the us treasury all it needed to absorb was anything that reacts with iodine going through the wash would do that heres another example of the same thing i am new here i do coins restoration and i authenticate ocean liner artifacts and golden hollywood autographs i was buying groceries last night at my local store and was surprised to see my bill not accepted all they knew was to look for the line and this pen test there is no doubt in my mind this is a genuine is this pen reaction normal for year old notes the manager seemed oblivious i could not believe he had never seen an older note and the manager was older than my years older notes are coming out of the woodwork these days i was also surprised he did not hold the note and call the police and the follow up if you read the pen or the package it came in it says will work on bills from and after meaning anybill from before series and before will come up as counterfiet even if the bill is real i think it has to do with the way the paper for money wasis made this would suggest that a note would react incorrectly and since im fairly certain noone at the school had this knowledge or incorrectly assumed the pen was infallible they would have acted as if the student absolutely was trying to push a fake note its an unfortunate situation but given this information its easy to see how events progressed especially when you consider there had been a previous incident with another student in the area passing an actual fake details in the same story i linked to
nottheonion,not_removed,did you even read the article they werent arrested they were brought to the police station while they looked into it sheesh we have enough race issues in this country without you making up new ones
nottheonion,not_removed,one district doesnt equal the entire state it doesnt even equal every employee in the district
nottheonion,not_removed,except a piece of paper sprayed with hairspray also tends to produce a real result with a pen

nottheonion,not_removed,if you remove my post due to a rule break then you should not give me a cool down timer to post it with the mistake corrected also i cant tell if after correcting the mistake that my post has now gone through because i click the updated link and it is still showing the old title that got the post removed in the first place
nottheonion,not_removed,least it wasnt filmed in portrait mode
nottheonion,not_removed,this is why i park at the back of the lot and walk in fighting over a parking spot when there is probably spots within meters and not like any of those nut cases are infirm
nottheonion,not_removed,holy fuck what is with that screeching shrew so fucking loud
nottheonion,not_removed,i had to look it up near toronto canada
nottheonion,not_removed,ive heard people say i will never shop at walmart thats where there trash shops
nottheonion,not_removed,that video is pretty funny jerry springer style
nottheonion,not_removed,i think yelling call the police would be a bad idea just call them dont announce it if youre the kind of person to get into a physical altercation over a parking spot youre probably the kind of person that might think if im going to jail its gonna be for something worthwhile and pull out a weapon
nottheonion,not_removed,the star but surprisingly not the world star
nottheonion,not_removed,sigh this is totally the costco i go to i cant say im surprised
nottheonion,not_removed,this is my costco hahahahahah well the parking lot is hell there but still oh canadians why have you abandoned your friendly personalities for a few savings on meat
nottheonion,not_removed,i feel bad for that cart attendant i mean costco pays way better than most retail but after a long day of pushing great big costco carts the last thing i imagine hed want to do would be caught in the middle of a fight for a freakin parking spot
nottheonion,not_removed,this sounds like a parks and rec episode
nottheonion,not_removed,it was even stabilized
nottheonion,not_removed,it always amazes me that people will spend several minutes finding a closer spot when it would have taken them less than minute to just walk the extra distance
nottheonion,not_removed,it totally worked though did you see that guy back way off of her after landing several weird punches on the other guy
nottheonion,not_removed,well at least they apologized
nottheonion,not_removed,also when you yell call the police nobody ends up calling the police youve got to do it yourself
nottheonion,not_removed,same was happy to see my neighbourhood in the news though
nottheonion,not_removed,each video player should have auto stabilization it would websites like worldstar actually watchable
nottheonion,not_removed,i feel like this is the twilight zone version of the internet
nottheonion,not_removed,and more time waiting for people to pull out or whatever
nottheonion,not_removed,toronto apologize dude toronto is basically the florida of canada
nottheonion,not_removed,i never thought id feel lucky to go to my particular costco but i feel lucky that my costco seems to be pretty civilized
nottheonion,not_removed,if i wasnt lazy i would post the video of michael scott driving his car into a lake
nottheonion,not_removed,all cars come standard with gps navigation common sense not included
nottheonion,not_removed,story doesnt have anything to do with gps they just added that to make it more interesting the driver turned too quickly lost control drove his car off the road and onto some guy wires accidents happen its fortunate nobody was hurt
nottheonion,not_removed,instructions too confusing dick got caught in ceiling fan
nottheonion,not_removed,why were the wires that close to the ground near the road in the first place
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,they were guy wires they anchor the pole to the ground to keep it from leaning over under the tension of the communication or power lines above as for why they were near the road i think a better question is why she was driving so far off the road especially without looking where she was going those guy wires actually have yellow plastic sheathes on them to make sure theyre visible you can see it in the photo
nottheonion,not_removed,google is supposed to be adding a guy wire update to show these in the future heh

nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like hes probably a paranoid schizophrenic thats depressing
nottheonion,not_removed,my neighbor thinks the government sent psyops to break into his house and stack all of his shoes in a pile against his front door
nottheonion,not_removed,making buffalo proud
nottheonion,not_removed,what do we do when of our voters follow nonsense like this the left has loonies but they dont keep them in positions of power or all over the airwaves
nottheonion,not_removed,in reality its a very elaborate scheme to plug color night vision which he developed and put on the appstore
nottheonion,not_removed,so he can only see in the microwave band because thats where current metamaterial cloaks work thats impressive
nottheonion,not_removed,i hear this guy on the radio all the time and hes laughable this story has been a big one and im pretty sure its a publicity stunt by bauerle
nottheonion,not_removed,its absolutely possible why all the skepticism do people sincerely think that this sort of info would in any way shape or form be confirmed
nottheonion,not_removed,devils advocate here it seems logically fallacious for adhomenim attack articles about people mental health to take center focus
nottheonion,not_removed,paranoid schizophrenic with a gun thats scary
nottheonion,not_removed,or at least abusing drugs that cause paranoid schizophrenia
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like he should invest in a carbon monoxide detector
nottheonion,not_removed,shit why did you just remind me of that playstation game that i really liked at the time that never got a sequel that it promised
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah you wont see big red or melissa click keeping positions of power after acting crazy the liberal side of things is still the sane one capable of selfpolicing meanwhile you have crazy religious and paranoid antigovernment people running for every office in the land as conservatives with full party backing insane that they try to make the liberal crazies outcastes with no power who are shunned by other liberals into the equivalent of conservative crazies with positions of power who are embraced by and empowered by other conservatives there will always be crazies the political side supporting insanity is the problem too bad they dont have the balls to tell these antigovernment conspiracy theorists and religious nuts to get out of their party
nottheonion,not_removed,not sure what youre trying to say but the article seemed pretty matteroffact rather than biased towards either side
nottheonion,not_removed,they need them they know their policies dont work that the old way works either anymorebut rather than look forward and say lets figure this out together all they care about is power without results
nottheonion,not_removed,what if hes telling the truth in these circumstances why do we always disbelieve
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know why you replied to me with that like i said the article didnt really seem to take a side in fact its almost ludicrously unbiased considering the situation
nottheonion,not_removed,just looked up the video dont do that

nottheonion,not_removed,thats gay
nottheonion,not_removed,ok guys pack up world problems are solved
nottheonion,not_removed,is it just me or is this really really stupid and a waste of money couldnt they improve relations better by spending that money on say an ad campaign it looks to cost between to send something to space and i dont see how doing that would make anything any better for anyone they could spend that money on an antibullying campaign or really anything other than something symbolic with no tangible benefits that will appear on page of the sun and nobody will know or care about
nottheonion,not_removed,alien see that flag over there alien yeah what do you think it means alien they probably have gold lets invade
nottheonion,not_removed,thats gonna end up sun bleached then well just be surrendering
nottheonion,not_removed,gayy lmao
nottheonion,not_removed,space
nottheonion,not_removed,sometime in the future aliens find rainbow flag in space what the fuck is this gay shit asks alien to its friend no further developments what the fuck did i do to that punctuation holy hell
nottheonion,not_removed,the thing is it will eventually be bleached soooo
nottheonion,not_removed,now aliens think were fags
nottheonion,not_removed,its all fun and games until you hit it going mph
nottheonion,not_removed,what if the homophobic aliens find it
nottheonion,not_removed,aliens see this as a declaration of war
nottheonion,not_removed,should have landed in iran
nottheonion,not_removed,soon itll be white from radiation then itll be the french flag
nottheonion,not_removed,unless their rationale was an attempt to spread aids i think theyve failed
nottheonion,not_removed,reminds me of that time the us spent billions of dollars to plant its flag in space
nottheonion,not_removed,if you think theres something wrong with being gay shame on you its
nottheonion,not_removed,nobody will know or care about well you seemed to have found out about it
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,costs something like to send it up in a highaltitude balloon but its also much less useful because actually getting something to orbit is much harder than getting it to space going high up is very easy but getting orbit requires lots of speed which is difficult to gain
nottheonion,not_removed,bear in mind that they didnt really send this flag into space any more than my pocket calculator could be said to be true ai where space begins is somewhat arbitrary earths atmosphere slowly peters out to an almost imperceptible level but theres no hard boundary its generally considered to be anywhere above miles this balloon managed to get miles up this is like saying you are going to walk across the us getting from new york city to charleston virginia and then saying eh close enough
nottheonion,not_removed,its not about helping people its about making a statement
nottheonion,not_removed,and then aliens will see it as a white flag taking it as a sign that we give up and are all ready for the harvest
nottheonion,not_removed,are you living in the
nottheonion,not_removed,gay rainbows have six colours for vexillological reasons often other groups wanting to use rainbows usually just use an extra two colours or dont care use six
nottheonion,not_removed,on the moon
nottheonion,not_removed,ah so the flag wasnt launched into space as the title states it was launched into space or more accurately attached to a weather balloon obviously i didnt read the article just the headline which is blatantly misleading even so this just makes the stunt even dumber and more pointless at least they didnt spend a metric fuckton of money on it
nottheonion,not_removed,worth every penny now any alien that visits will know who owns the moon
nottheonion,not_removed,the french

nottheonion,not_removed,repost i get sick eating krispy kremes they must have lot preservatives
nottheonion,not_removed,the cop said the roadside test said it was meth the guy says they said it was crack at first do cops even test drugs on the street at all or are crispy creamed full of crack and meth
nottheonion,not_removed,i recognized through my years of training and experience as a law enforcement officer the substance to be some sort of narcotic the officer wrote in her report huhone would think that with eleven years of training and experience she of all people would recognize the prime ingredient from her professions primary source of sustenance

nottheonion,not_removed,this is a repost
nottheonion,not_removed,roadside tests are a gimmick they change colors for thousands of other chemicals besides drugs and officers dont realize this
nottheonion,not_removed,recent article that looked at some comprehensive studies said that about of the results that are positive for drugs are in fact not drugs

nottheonion,not_removed,i like that his religion allows him to remove the turban when someone is in danger
nottheonion,not_removed,this is an awesome story my only exposure to sikhs turbans was from the movie inside man this prompted me to look into it a little bit more and it makes this story even cooler

nottheonion,not_removed,so people vote for him getting tenure then people vote for him getting tenure then one person exercises her right to veto this and everyone reviews the veto and finds it baseless but nothing changes whats really going on here just give him the tenure the vote is over and he won in a landslide just another instance where the minority overrules the majority
nottheonion,not_removed,who is this professor hunger and where will he strike next
nottheonion,not_removed,hey this is my college its an overreaction to be sure but he does have reason to be upset he was nearly unanimously recommended to recieve tenure by his department and the committee but the president of the college vetoed it
nottheonion,not_removed,im glad he wasnt a drama professor or else he wouldve been chewing up the scenery
nottheonion,not_removed,just in time for the temple of the dog album rerelease
nottheonion,not_removed,who is this professor hunger and where will he strike next
nottheonion,not_removed,hunger strikes only work against entities that have a legal responsibility to keep you alive like prisons
nottheonion,not_removed,im shawn spencer psychic detective and this is my partner prof hunger strikes
nottheonion,not_removed,professor pickles professor hunger
nottheonion,not_removed,it may not be baseless having been in the academia really anything could have happened it could be that the six on the board were cozy with the professor in question and were colluding to give him promotion university faculties are often small tightknitted groups in this case it makes sense that a more senior bureaucrat is brought in to nuke the recommendation or it could be that the professor and the president had a bit of falling out academics can be extremely petty sometimes and the latter blocked the promotion out of spite in this case the university will try to override the veto
nottheonion,not_removed,people get passed up for promotions that they deserve ever single day if he really is as good as he thinks he is he will start again somewhere else and get tenured you cant keep good people down forever
nottheonion,not_removed,so there isnt a mechanism to override that veto
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty much what i thought on reading this
nottheonion,not_removed,is no one safe
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know that it even is an overreaction being denied tenure is the end of your career not only can he not keep his position but hes also essentially unhireable in academia unless he started at a hightier school and can try again at a school thats a couple steps down its like a lawyer being disbarred absolutely guts you professionally to know that happened due to unclear reasons from a single person overriding a nearunanimous opinion makes it so much worse
nottheonion,not_removed,to be fair an ethics professor did set the same building this guy teaches in on fire because he didnt get tenure so by comparison this almost seems reasonable
nottheonion,not_removed,how many times are you going to post this comment my hope is all the times and they are all gilded
nottheonion,not_removed,perhaps but i think some jobs still ascribe to the old ways of respecting your time at the position prior to promotion such as being a professor unlike most of us who get promotions by job hopping this professor wouldnt be able to get automatic tenure at a new position in negotiations acquiring tenure requires time dedication and a fair bit of office politics hes staring at a loss of time invested that is simply not paralleled in other fields where transferring may be no big deal ie nurses or office workers changing locations plus professors tend to be part of a community much moreso than a usual job hes standing to lose a lot of ties if he decides to leave if hes a sociable type it might still be the right move but i can understand why hes feeling desperate and willing to do anything he can before taking that option
nottheonion,not_removed,this is my alma mater its actually pretty surprising the president is relatively new started my senior year years ago and is almost universally beloved especially after the previous president who was almost universally disliked its really mindboggling im guessing she has a reason for it but i wouldnt be surprised if she reverses her decision to save face
nottheonion,not_removed,i have serious doubts about the qualifications of this ethics professor
nottheonion,not_removed,are you saying college professors are the only people that lose their seniority when they switch employers because you are just dead wrong on that one if anything they have the easiest time switching of any profession ive ever heard of they teach at this place then they teach at that place the only major difference is the amount of money they get sure there are little perks here and there but basically you are still just teaching now take me for example right now i sit in an air conditioned office surfing the web and goofing off all but hours a day and even that is mainly just making sure other people are working if i was to quit i would go back to the bottom i would be working like a slave in the heat doing the dirty disgusting jobs that i was originally hired to do and i would do that in a heartbeat if i had to but i am sure i would be hurting alot more than this guy would if he switched to another school
nottheonion,not_removed,my high school health teacher was a virgin
nottheonion,not_removed,first of all how do you know that second of all dont tell me
nottheonion,not_removed,she admitted it in class was very open about being abstinent and waiting for marriage we were her first class ever as a teacher so she was no more than mid and kinda unfortunate looking

nottheonion,not_removed,really juvie wouldnt it be cool if they have a room in the school thats like a little jail where naughty children could be detained for a period of time to rehabilitate after misbehaving maybe this could be accompanied by a note home to parents about misdeeds idk guess im just dreaming
nottheonion,not_removed,years ago teacher cant control the students maybe he or she shouldnt be a teacher today teacher cant control the students zhe should call the cops and get the students arrested
nottheonion,not_removed,the breakfast club would never happen today
nottheonion,not_removed,so now were arresting the classclown what i cant even
nottheonion,not_removed,like oh i dont know detention or saturday school i know far out ideas like this dont belong in the classroom
nottheonion,not_removed,you mean like iss thats a great idea you should run for president and show these clowns how its done s
nottheonion,not_removed,really juvie obviously there is a lot of other stuff that should be tried first as youve mentioned but if the kid is repeatedly choosing to continue being a dickhead then i dont really have a problem with this outcome if he just did it once and they called the police then its way over the top but it should still be on the table as an option that can be escalated to
nottheonion,not_removed,today teacher cant control the students zhe should call the cops and get the students arrested can say from experience is the parents people put it on teachers but really from we are only responsible for of their time their parents are responsible for but blame the for the failure instead of the if a student is taught the only way to talk to some else is calling them mtrfkr there is nothing i can do in minutes to change that
nottheonion,not_removed,more like years ago
nottheonion,not_removed,dont worry theyll handle this internally
nottheonion,not_removed,you are not wrong but many of those students parents already do more demeaning jobs then that so they think that is a promotion in life
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah the article didnt really go out of its way to provide much detail i would hate to be that kid answering the what are you in for question surrounded by a bunch of young wanna be thugs though like the guy from alices restaurant who was arrested for littering
nottheonion,not_removed,mob mentality hheees gaht bahgal on is ed police board train silence that was like a primary school class when a teacher walks in fucking plebs
nottheonion,not_removed,the great northern service from kings cross to huntingdon says it all vomit comet night train
nottheonion,not_removed,hahaha the silence when the copper showed up like being in school
nottheonion,not_removed,someone put a chicken on my lap once on a bus i was pissed at the owner of the chicken but said nothing as i dont like confrontation i was really scared the chicken was gonna shit on my lap
nottheonion,not_removed,maaaan one bagel yeah funny two bagels pretty funny but not as funny as the first time three bagels alright now its just getting retarded fucking bagels im going to murder your wife and kids
nottheonion,not_removed,everyone in this video is fucking years old i remember these same sorts of games from middle school they dont age well
nottheonion,not_removed,welcome to britain the land of drunkards
nottheonion,not_removed,is it common in the uk for people to have that many bagels on them after a night of drinking
nottheonion,not_removed,its so funny to pick on people and make their lives horrible
nottheonion,not_removed,i still think that man reacts very calm chucking not but of the bagels out before he gets mad honestly i would have probably already started throwing the bagel at full speed at those people with the or you dont put food in peoples hair that is nasty and the whole childish mob mentality with the bagel on iz ed doesnt make it any better this isnt just some childdrunk person who doesnt know bounderaries but a whole group of people trying to make you the butt of their joke and basically being bullies
nottheonion,not_removed,fight on uk train after people kept assaulting other passengers fixed
nottheonion,not_removed,everyone at work has been emailing this clip around to each other i look very much like the guy whos head they kept putting the bagel on and he reacted pretty much like i would have
nottheonion,not_removed,these bagel fights are happening quite a lox lately
nottheonion,not_removed,if you put that bagel on my head i will put a halo around yours
nottheonion,not_removed,this is basically every last train on a friday or saturday night in britain fuck this place
nottheonion,not_removed,rmadlads
nottheonion,not_removed,lol when the cops board the train everyone looks like they just got yelled at by their grandma
nottheonion,not_removed,look at the huge amount of peanut butter on that thing i would fucking choke on that
nottheonion,not_removed,so why doesnt that guy break that cunts nose white knight instinct
nottheonion,not_removed,honestly the love of public drunkeness in britain is a national disgrace its really quite shameful the way its celebrated
nottheonion,not_removed,i fucking hate being british
nottheonion,not_removed,twats the lot ev em
nottheonion,not_removed,grade was more mature than this
nottheonion,not_removed,woah woah woah who puts peanut butter on a bagel
nottheonion,not_removed,i love the dead silence when police get there
nottheonion,not_removed,i hope they get significant custodial sentences and before anyone starts whining about bullys rights consider that i would probably get a custodial sentence if i punched them for putting a bagel on my head
nottheonion,not_removed,the only fight i ever really had was on a uk train but it was about a single walkers crisp on a shoulder not a bagel on the head i should add that i was the crispplacer and so a large amount of the responsibility for the incident falls on my head i should also add that this happened during high school where everyone is an asshole the guy and me knew eachother werent really friends or enemies until this day and he was sitting and joking with us he was better acquainted with a few of my buddies than he was with me i placed a crisp on his shoulder more as a strange way of offering a gift than anything i was a weird dude back in school and got laughs for this kinda behavior and being a teenage boy i kept it up for the approval but he didnt seem to like or want it he said seemingly quite light heartedly dont do that again or else he had this overthetop serious voice and face on and pointed an accusatory finger at me so i placed another crisp on his shoulder fully convinced by his reaction that we were having a joke with one another nope he took a long raspy inhale and spat a big lump of saliva onto my chest i could see bits of the prawn curry hed just been eating thats when all hell broke loose now im no fighter and as i said this was the only fight i ever had but something about seeing and feeling his salivachewed up food on me made me see red like ive never done since things went very badly for the prawn muncher that day to this day ive still wondered was i being a complete knob likely or was he completely overreacting by spitting on me also likely ive always had mixed feelings of guilt about this episode being one of the very few instances of violence in my life it was nice to write it down
nottheonion,not_removed,they had bread head
nottheonion,not_removed,this is the most british thing ever potters bar the train will not move 😂😂 but seriously stop wasting those bagels biatches
nottheonion,not_removed,bagel fighting only in britain
nottheonion,not_removed,theyre is a further twist to this story it would seem the offending bagel was bought by one of the passengers nana earlier in the day at morrisons
nottheonion,not_removed,wait so did the woman who put the bagel on theans head get into the fight
nottheonion,not_removed,this is why you shouldnt let provincials into london
nottheonion,not_removed,legit cops climb aboard and then theres total silence 😂😂
nottheonion,not_removed,rmadlads
nottheonion,not_removed,and this is why i never leave the house without a loaf of battle bread and a couple of drop scones
nottheonion,not_removed,free bagel hat sounds like a great day to me
nottheonion,not_removed,i rock bagels on my head but dont call me a bagel head
nottheonion,not_removed,ah classic saturday night drunk train i see shit like this all every weekend albeit on the euston line this is fairly tame compared to most although very annoying you can have some mental conversations though and i quite like messing with peoples minds
nottheonion,not_removed,the video also shows brawls in the carriage and outside on the platform it is not known if these were connected to the bagels nah thats just england
nottheonion,not_removed,i havent people act so immaturely with food since secondary school why on earth are adults acting like that
nottheonion,not_removed,here in the us we dont waste a good bagel the overweight american joke
nottheonion,not_removed,well i cant complain about free donuts
nottheonion,not_removed,are you having a loaf
nottheonion,not_removed,please do not try this in texas we love pranksters here
nottheonion,not_removed,i would have just got up and moved carriage or proclaimed myself the bagel king and play along with their drunken game why get myself in trouble cos other people are drunk after a night out its not worth the hassle
nottheonion,not_removed,is this like a fraternity spring break trip
nottheonion,not_removed,these people were ready to square up over some fucking bagels thats the funniest shit ive seen today
nottheonion,not_removed,were those bagels glutenfree
nottheonion,not_removed,alright i see everyones point about feeling intimidated and everything but i gotta say i found this hilarious maybe it was just the reporting in but i laughed so long and hard that it broke me out of my shitty mood and off to work still chuckling the whole this just struck me as so british especially the line a man is then seen becoming increasingly cross as a group of people sitting behind him pester him with bagels i mean im of quite nervous disposition but the way the standard reported it i feel like had i been bagel guy i would have been laughing and probably ended up singing along as well
nottheonion,not_removed,dunno why the guy didnt just eat the bagel
nottheonion,not_removed,jesus people will cry about literally anything someone put a bagel on your head and you blithering idiots are talking about assault fucking cry babies if you ever walk outside your moms basement im sure youd be reduced to screams in an instant the world doesnt revolve around you
nottheonion,not_removed,the video of white people in clean circumstances well dressed well fed warm dry safe and enjoying the benefits of well wherever the money came from that made their pretend lives possible warms my heart so fragile and easily prompted to violence charming this to me seems exploitable of course western culture is great you will prevail in the face of all challenges your noble vision of the ascendance of the individual is bwaahaha naw you inability to cooperate means youre doomed look at the way the broad base in the video seeks violence when interposing forces dont intervene its very telling youre doomed
nottheonion,not_removed,sadly a lot of people here in the uk dont get past that year old bully mentality something about mobmentality and trying to seem tough sticks around in a lot of peoples personalities admittedly the minority make a big enough stink to show us all up but this behaviour wouldnt surprise me no matter where in the uk i was
nottheonion,not_removed,very much doubt they would have been pulling that shit if the lad was and stone fucking hate bullys
nottheonion,not_removed,thank sweet baby jesus that there are others who see it this way like wow i saw the video on facebook and just skimmed the comments and everyone was just saying how hilarious it was and crap like snitches get stitches i felt so confused like i watched a different video or misunderstood something
nottheonion,not_removed,used to ride this train a lot seen far worse on it most of these people are from saffron walden its full of chavs in chinos
nottheonion,not_removed,irish in the uk this video is a great reminder that no matter what happens with brexit i at least have the options to leave not like all the poor cunts potentially trapped on this island with those cunts
nottheonion,not_removed,haha yep my thoughts exactly you could almost hear them thinking please dont arrest me please dont arrest me if i was blonde bagel boy id have grassed them all right up
nottheonion,not_removed,did you just call it a boggle
nottheonion,not_removed,oh man thats my line id better watch out for bagel attacks
nottheonion,not_removed,if someone put a live chicken on my lap id be ecstatic and would probably play with the chicken for the rest of the ride if someone put cooked chicken in my lap id be pissed
nottheonion,not_removed,people putting their cocks on your lap is pretty much par for the course on a bus
nottheonion,not_removed,free chicken
nottheonion,not_removed,man i would love that i was imaging like a crawshaws whole cooked chicken initially but a live chicken would be even better
nottheonion,not_removed,i woulda snapped its neck and walked off with the chicken at the next stop out of principle before someone calls me edgy ive been on a farm before and been shown how to do it pretty easily
nottheonion,not_removed,hahaha
nottheonion,not_removed,its a train from kings cross they are sloshed
nottheonion,not_removed,the blight of banter
nottheonion,not_removed,except they all look about
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe its a london thing usually its greasy kebabs shit but amazing sfc mcdonalds nuggets chinese indian sheep but bagels is a weird one
nottheonion,not_removed,i feel like micky flanagan is to blame for the increase in baked goods whilst being drunk
nottheonion,not_removed,twoth tooth i like it
nottheonion,not_removed,i hope they get custodial sentences
nottheonion,not_removed,dont you dare start another crumby pun thread
nottheonion,not_removed,salmon might say its become endemic
nottheonion,not_removed,stop being boring theyre wasted you act like youve never done anything dumb while off your tits on drink
nottheonion,not_removed,this lad is indeed quite mad
nottheonion,not_removed,i would fucking choke on that things your mom said for alex
nottheonion,not_removed,it might just be the nut allergy
nottheonion,not_removed,i know right who eats a bagel like that
nottheonion,not_removed,believe it or not some people dont see it necessary to escalate fights even if the other person is in the wrong he might also be wary of starting a fight with half the people in the carriage
nottheonion,not_removed,youre suggesting putting someone in fucking jail for putting a bit of bread on someones head on the drunk train seems rational s
nottheonion,not_removed,you were being a total fucking rube you harassed him he harassed you back you took the opportunity to twist it into a justification for a physical altercation i assume you were bigger than this individual yes
nottheonion,not_removed,no because thank god we dont have the retarded idea of fraternities over here
nottheonion,not_removed,thats actually a website with a picture of a spoon on it

nottheonion,not_removed,id proclaim myself the bagel king or just leave the carriage if i wasnt in the mood to be their king lifes too short to cry about a bagel crown
nottheonion,not_removed,a noble thing to fight about indeed what being disrespected and assaulted
nottheonion,not_removed,itd probably give him herpes
nottheonion,not_removed,you can see in the video it was upsetting the passengers they certainly did not consider it lighthearted right what would you do if someone put some random item on your head and started calling you his little bitch
nottheonion,not_removed,is this a bet to see how many downvotes you can get its very good
nottheonion,not_removed,passengers in a coma after placing bagel on black teenagers head people beheaded after placing bagel on saudi arabian mans head

nottheonion,not_removed,listen baby boomer if youre as old as you say you are frankly you give off a midteen vibe thats euphoric with his own intelligence you are not that smart for your generation if youre old perhaps but not today people like you are tenapenny and you remind me of someone i used to know in school who himself thought he was a hot sack of intellectual shit fun fact about that guy he was arrested for sending explicit messages to preteens maybe you have some sort of sapient fuckup that compels you to strive and prove your mental capacity over others daytoday on such a trivial medium as this good luck with the remaining max years of your life you show great potential youre a very special human being indeed very well done

nottheonion,not_removed,there is only one thing worse than a cunt
nottheonion,not_removed,you laugh but its no joke my shaman dr confucius llewelyn chopramoonbeam says theres enough toxins in a single bagel to give a horse bad luck for ten years do you really want to risk absorbing that through your hair which is like a direct line to your brain
nottheonion,not_removed,i also only allow live or raw chicken to touch my clothing
nottheonion,not_removed,youd be pissed over free food
nottheonion,not_removed,for me either way soon or later im eating that chicken its mine now

nottheonion,not_removed,actually peanuts are legumes not tree nuts so it wouldnt be a nut allergy itd be a peanut allergy
nottheonion,not_removed,yes it is its bullying and humiliation if i put a piece of dog shit on your head how would you feel
nottheonion,not_removed,same size but yes this is what i thought could have been the case it was a long time ago and i was a dumb kid and like i say i feel guilty about it but at the time it was a snap reaction i didnt really think about it and certainly didnt intend on trying to twist it into a justification for violence i am not and never have been a violent person i just flipped out when i saw that he had spat on me i could have done this to anyone else in our group at the time and they wouldnt have reacted like that although its not a justification and i should have controlled my temper better at that time thank you for giving me the tellingoff i deserved edit missing word
nottheonion,not_removed,down with frats we want bagel hats
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree that frats are dumb but i wouldnt get all high and mighty here given that the stupidity that started this thread was also over there
nottheonion,not_removed,lmao so the people there are just naturally stupid
nottheonion,not_removed,i see youve played fightywebsitewithapictureofaspoononit before
nottheonion,not_removed,fighting because you got disrespected yeah no thats not a valid reason everyone who thinks it is is also always the kind of people who feel like theyve been disrespected for any and every thing you do getting assaulted i get you are right to use as much force as is necessary in order to protect yourself from bodily harm good luck convincing a judge that the bagels were threatening to your health
nottheonion,not_removed,just being in that carriage probably gave him herpes
nottheonion,not_removed,hed cry because he has a personality disorder
nottheonion,not_removed,laugh it off because im not an insecure idiot
nottheonion,not_removed,thank you you would be surprised that i saw this referenced event in frames without video or sound my comment is a gestalt distilled from my interpretation at a remove from what is the dynamic and operative imperative of cultural and global change it may be that violence is a subconscious mechanism that the entity you recognize as humanity uses to enact an adaptive modification in response to changing environmental parameters possibly your perception of individualism is an illusion your contributive experience may actually be an algorithmic modifier that is additivly combined with billions of other contributions to develop a response to the signal of climate change dont interpret my assessment as judgmental im a disinterested observer i dont have a dog in this fight still on balance i think the universe is better with humanity than without thats just my opinion hope you make it im rooting for you
nottheonion,not_removed,oh god the rowdy loud and drunk holidays yeah it gives us a bad name and is absolutely disrespectful of the places you are going to its horrendous how the mentality shifts to im on holiday for a good time and fuck everybody else
nottheonion,not_removed,took me a good while to realize that this wasnt gibberish
nottheonion,not_removed,do not doo
nottheonion,not_removed,people who think reporting crimes is worse than committing them
nottheonion,not_removed,not a problem i have the power of wishy thinking on side bad luck can fuck off
nottheonion,not_removed,honestly i bathe myself in raw chicken regardless
nottheonion,not_removed,assault has an actual legal definition and its usually depending on the jurisdiction to make someone feel a credible threat of endangerment someone touching you is not assault it could be called battery if you wanted to argue that you were harmed in some way or it could be assault if you were deathly afraid of bagels and they knew and did it anyway
nottheonion,not_removed,it it but a non bagel assault wouldnt fit in this sub right
nottheonion,not_removed,i would love that please free food and its kinda funny i would put them back on their head and make a friend and laugh with them then again im not an asshole
nottheonion,not_removed,im sure he wouldnt call the police like a huge fcking puy imagine being such a beta male you cant deal with any of your problems without calling the pigs pathetic
nottheonion,not_removed,doesnt make it assault probably harassment though
nottheonion,not_removed,rye see what you did there
nottheonion,not_removed,yeast you will
nottheonion,not_removed,shuck it trebek sean connery
nottheonion,not_removed,arachibutyrophobia
nottheonion,not_removed,a peanut allergy not a tree nut allergy
nottheonion,not_removed,yes because putting physical shit on someone equates to a bit of dry bread
nottheonion,not_removed,assaulted doesnt require harm
nottheonion,not_removed,id throw the bagel at them because its been in their greasy hands and its been in my hair id go all randy marsh on their ass with a bagel i could fuck anyone up with a bagel
nottheonion,not_removed,fighting because you got disrespected yeah no thats not a valid reason everyone who thinks it is is also always the kind of people who feel like theyve been disrespected for any and every thing you do getting assaulted i get you are right to use as much force as is necessary in order to protect yourself from bodily harm good luck convincing a judge that the bagels were threatening to your health now i know who is a bitch who i can put bagels on their head maybe ill up it everyday on the train until i put dogshit on your head
nottheonion,not_removed,really he seems pretty beta he needs to find some respect for himself im loath to tell him that though because he seems like he hears that a lot and he needs some positive reinforcement
nottheonion,not_removed,is the weather nice up there in the moral ivory tower
nottheonion,not_removed,trying to sound smart makes you look stupid
nottheonion,not_removed,riamverysmart
nottheonion,not_removed,youre a tosser you know that right
nottheonion,not_removed,oh god the cringe
nottheonion,not_removed,littered with nonsensical sentences
nottheonion,not_removed,not enough colons a
nottheonion,not_removed,good lord that is an embarassment to read so cringy
nottheonion,not_removed,hahaha who here likes a good story about a bridge
nottheonion,not_removed,you seem like an idiot
nottheonion,not_removed,this post made me cringe so hard my solar plexus started fizzing if you really want to use obscure words its important to make sure you understand how to use them
nottheonion,not_removed,u gay
nottheonion,not_removed,this was seen as immature because others are retarded it was immature in reality because your delivery was condescending for patient people with intelligence we saw your comment as raw intuition used on not enough study hopefully this feedback helps
nottheonion,not_removed,having had two sets of nightmare noisy neighbours this attitude is increasingly prevalent everywhere i find i think its something to do with the kids of the me generation coming of age having being raised to not give a shit about anyone else but themselves
nottheonion,not_removed,sure seems like doodoo
nottheonion,not_removed,yes but on the drunk train those munchies will not stay inside them for very long though our train companies are not known for their great business sense
nottheonion,not_removed,go to brick lane mate great salt beef bagels
nottheonion,not_removed,id argue that if somebody kept on placing bagels on my head even after its been made clear that im not into the joke theyre trying to instigate a fight if i were on a train and this happened to me id have no doubt that its assault especially with such a large group of people being that loud and chanting at my misfortune are you saying that if you got onto a train and people were laughing at you whilst placing things on your head you wouldnt feel threatened
nottheonion,not_removed,here in the uk as a starting point where there is no injury or injuries which are not serious the offence charged should generally be common assault httpwwwcpsgovuklegalltoooffencesagainsttheperson so no injury is required to press a charge of assault
nottheonion,not_removed,whilst i appreciate youre just expanding on its only a bagel i would certainly feel threatened if a group of strangers turned their attention to me to involve me in something i have no idea of what im a part of it may not fit the textbook version of the word but im sure it would make most people feel uneasy
nottheonion,not_removed,usually the key phrase now is cause fear being trapped and victimised by a large group like that where the victim could possibly expect violence as a result of active attempts to disengage from the situation could see all involved charged
nottheonion,not_removed,hes using the proper legal definition of assault here though so could you stop trying to lecture in something you dont know
nottheonion,not_removed,battery applies if the contact is either harmful or unwanted similarly one need not be deathly afraid of contact for assault just that it is harmful or unwanted and that the victim has a moment to anticipatefear it in most of the us i could make a case for battery after the first bagel and assault after the second
nottheonion,not_removed,someone touching you with a bagel is not assault it could be called bakery ftfy
nottheonion,not_removed,as you said it depends on the jurisdiction although i cbf looking it up right now im fairly sure that in my jurisdiction assault means applying a force to another person without that persons permission that would include placing a bagel on the head of another person without permission edit in the jurisdiction applicable to the incident in question the offence is some form of assault regardless of what its called where you are
nottheonion,not_removed,someone touching you is not assault technically youre right its common assault
nottheonion,not_removed,what would you do after youve eaten the fifth bagel they put on your head youre full and they have more bagels that they continue to put on your head
nottheonion,not_removed,so how do you deal with a group of people who keep putting a bagel on your head specifically exactly what actions should you take remember theyre not stopping putting a bagel on your head just because you dont like it and make sure dont cross the line into criminal activity yourself so exactly what do you do
nottheonion,not_removed,its legal definition is common assault so youre incorrect
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont think im bready for any more puns
nottheonion,not_removed,bagels and cream cheeshh
nottheonion,not_removed,bless you
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks
nottheonion,not_removed,who gets to decide which is worse
nottheonion,not_removed,yee
nottheonion,not_removed,something to do with the kids of the me generation doubt it we have been pissing people off abroad for decades hell if anything thanks to the decrease in football violence from the brits anyway we are slightly improving not everything is down to those darn young people
nottheonion,not_removed,i think its something to do with the kids of the me generation coming of age having being raised to not give a shit about anyone else but themselves weve been acting like idiots abroad for a long long time its just the advent of camera phones and then social media which have made it a lot more obvious
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe but from personal experience no group is able to act more privileged than the generation born in the and the younger generations might be rowdier but i think it has more to do with age than how and when they were raised
nottheonion,not_removed,its the result of dueling and firearms being illegal
nottheonion,not_removed,i would say it would be fair game from a legal point of view for bagel head to feel threatened enough to retaliate with some real violence punches
nottheonion,not_removed,are you saying that if you got onto a train and people were laughing at you whilst placing things on your head you wouldnt feel threatened i would probably feel quite annoyed and embarrassed if i didnt want to be involved im not sure id be threatened but even if i was a court would have to decide it was a credible threat of endangerment not just to my ego
nottheonion,not_removed,merely pointing a finger aggressively at someone could be considered common assault in the uk
nottheonion,not_removed,so no injury is required to press a charge of assault of course not because injury is battery i want to make that clear thank you for helping i think edit battery or assault causing harm in places using british terminology either way the difference between those and assault should be clear
nottheonion,not_removed,make most people feel uneasy right but thats still not assault otherwise wed all be writing up police reports every time we saw a rerun of the uk office it real is a credible threat of endangerment you could of course make the claim you felt threatened by the game and your involvement in it by strangers but then its up to you to argue that in a court of law
nottheonion,not_removed,touch me to make me involved even with a bagel hes using the proper legal definition of assault here though touch me with a bagel touch me
nottheonion,not_removed,in most of the us did you miss the bit where this occurred not in the us
nottheonion,not_removed,battery is a us thing in the uk there are a few shades of assault
nottheonion,not_removed,thinskull rule might apply if he was deathly allergic to bagels for assault there has to be a credible threat so i dont have to go around avoiding saying hello to people with an irrational fear of the letter o deathly was probably the wrong word for me to use yes as i guess you could imply it to mean he actually dies of fright
nottheonion,not_removed,tupperware
nottheonion,not_removed,eat it no more bagel problem solved
nottheonion,not_removed,go in to the bathroom and lock the door or yell at them really fucking loudly
nottheonion,not_removed,only if you could prove that the perpetrator had intent to cause harm or make the victim feel as if they were going to cause harm if you cannot prove either case its not common assault an assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent present ability to cause the harm you are incorrect but at least youve fooled everyone into thinking otherwise
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont think any of you have risen to this occasion
nottheonion,not_removed,hes actually a time traveller
nottheonion,not_removed,baby boomers are the worst just horrible travellers children of the age of entitlement made sour and greedy by thatcherism
nottheonion,not_removed,while traveling i noticed the spanish and dutch bore a lot of the brunt of this behavior from brits
nottheonion,not_removed,were certainly not helping though source am young person
nottheonion,not_removed,i think people have a right to use public transport without feeling threatend it is reasonable to think that these actions could be intimidating or threatening to an individual regardless of ego i mean the guys what average build and hes getting harrassed by a large group of people if i was in his situation id be feeling pretty threatened because its pretty common for this kind of harrassment to escalate all it takes is for of these people to get off the same stop as you and youre going to feel like youre going to get stabbed even assuming this guy was actually only annoyed or embarrassed hes getting harrassed and thats bullshit you downplay this as though he should just man up but thats exactly the kind of attitude that causes this unreasonable treatment of others in the first place
nottheonion,not_removed,jesus christ lad you are so full of absolute shit the lowest charge which can be brought here is assault the definition of assault is the application of force to your body without consent or the reasonable apprehension that immediate force may be applied this is the irish definition which we lifted from the uks nonfatal offences so im sure its still the same not only is there an actual force applied here with the bagel on his head with the additional fights kicking off in the train and the people chanting and laughing at you any reasonable person would feel that could in that moment be assaulted now would you ever fuck off back to your books and stop spewing out shite misinformation
nottheonion,not_removed,could you find me the source for this please i remember reading this somewhere but i cant for the life of me find it anymore i think it was as ridiculous as a police officer deeming you stared at him negatively was grounds enough for him to arrest you
nottheonion,not_removed,battery doesnt exist in the uk you have assault assault causing harm and assault causing serious harm gbh edit i wouldnt mind but from the looks of other comments and flairs you are irish we dont even use battery here either where are you getting the notion at all
nottheonion,not_removed,me
nottheonion,not_removed,as we agreed in a slightly different thread it depends on the jurisdiction i now know of at least two where assault means applying a force
nottheonion,not_removed,nope battery is a uk think too its a common law offence in the uk
nottheonion,not_removed,go in to the bathroom and lock the door run away and let the assaulters have the space youve paid for yell at them really fucking loudly or escalate the situation without any guarantee of a resolution theyre yelling back now what
nottheonion,not_removed,no cause harm is battery assault is commonly defined is cause fear now also noteworthy that fear is defined by the victim
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont knead this abuse im off to bread to get some sleep
nottheonion,not_removed,yall just gesalty
nottheonion,not_removed,yeh we love sun and weed sorry
nottheonion,not_removed,even assuming this guy was actually only annoyed or embarrassed hes getting harrassed and thats bullshit you downplay this as though he should just man up but thats exactly the kind of attitude that causes this unreasonable treatment of others in the first place please dont put words in my mouth im defending the legal definition of assault not the actions of the people involved there are better charges that could be made such as public disorder
nottheonion,not_removed,the guy probably cant even take the train anymore without worrying about one of these idiots somehow being pissed at him
nottheonion,not_removed,youre a huge vagina
nottheonion,not_removed,as i understand it there is something about the legal definition of assault involves the threat of violence you dont actually have to attack them
nottheonion,not_removed,i learnt that battery existed in the uk going off my a level law if even says on the battery wikipedia that is an offence under the law of england and wales im really confused on what youre on about
nottheonion,not_removed,edit i wouldnt mind but from the looks of other comments and flairs you are irish we dont even use battery here either where are you getting the notion at all from living abroad for most of my adult life the definition of assault which doesnt involve actual physical harm doesnt change regardless
nottheonion,not_removed,as we agreed in a slightly different thread it depends on the jurisdiction which is what i led with however this specific jurisdiction does not include applying a force harm in its definition of assault a distinction which i also mentioned in the first post i made in this quagmire
nottheonion,not_removed,look man you dont know how it would play out and neither do i the fact of the matter is he called the piglice before he tried any of the above all for a practical joke if you wanna pretend thats justified then go ahead just know that he is a pathetic loser with less strength both physical and mental than a gnat if hes content with being that fine but im gonna point it out and im not gonna mince words
nottheonion,not_removed,i didnt say cause harm i said threat of harm its like right there in my post read the post
nottheonion,not_removed,wrong country mate
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont see wheat all the fuss is about
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont intend to put words in your mouth i asked how you would feel in his position to encourage some empathy towards his situation that you might realize that this is likely a threatening situation for him if youre particular experience would be of embarrasment and annoyance i again try to apply that to the person were discussing even if youre only trying to defend the legal definition of assault i still feel as though youre undermining this persons experiences to be below the requirements of assault by implying that this is somehow related to ego or that this was just someone touching you being in a vehicle with a group of people repeatedly invade your space using you as a prop for humour repeatedly forcing you to participate in their joke hes outnumbered and repeatedly forced to participate against his will i would say that fear is an absolutely reasonable response here
nottheonion,not_removed,judging by the context i guess i should say thank you
nottheonion,not_removed,then it would be fairly wise not to start talking about it then
nottheonion,not_removed,this specific jurisdiction does not include applying a force harm in its definition of assault does this specific jurisdiction here mean your jurisdiction or the one applicable in the bagel incident
nottheonion,not_removed,really i pita you
nottheonion,not_removed,then it would be fairly wise not to start talking about it then in what way assault causing harm is battery
nottheonion,not_removed,both im irish the incident was in the uk
nottheonion,not_removed,this thread is toast
nottheonion,not_removed,youre still using a legal term from one jurisdiction and trying to stick it in another arguably that might be acceptable in common conversation but not in a courtroom or other legal discussion
nottheonion,not_removed,not in the uk and considering your muh legal definitions you guys youd think that youd want to fucking know them before youd be getting so caught up on them
nottheonion,not_removed,arguably that might be acceptable in common conversation but not in a courtroom or other legal discussion good advice hey this thread is pretty rnottheonion by itself
nottheonion,not_removed,in what way assault causing harm is battery not in the uk explain the difference to me then youre telling me uselessly for this topic because nobody was battered and nobody was harmed but away we go that theres a presumably important difference between battery and assault causing harm other than terminology what is it

nottheonion,not_removed,this is a false story it actually belongs on the onion that sorry i tased you cake was on the internet a year before this story came out
nottheonion,not_removed,on the one hand she got tased on the other hand she got free cake
nottheonion,not_removed,did his fucking kid make this
nottheonion,not_removed,all of the other sources i find were from banned websites
nottheonion,not_removed,aw shoo
nottheonion,not_removed,fuck a stupid cake and this asshole cop
nottheonion,not_removed,no it was a professional and awardwinning cake decorator but he had no money so he was tasing her for encouragement
nottheonion,not_removed,interesting to say the least i would probably have called the police thinking it is a failed attempt of smuggling money i consider it more likely that they mixed up the address than that they would store their till in a food box
nottheonion,not_removed,i would have so pulled a mr potter
nottheonion,not_removed,i live there
nottheonion,not_removed,well in that case id like to place an order for several thousand dollars please
nottheonion,not_removed,or a somewhat successful attempt at hiding money for a short amount of time eg just before a raid if they had already planned to break into her house to collect the money after the raid
nottheonion,not_removed,im still not convinced that isnt the case a wad of cash looks very little like a pizza
nottheonion,not_removed,master has presented dobby with thousands of dollars dobby is free
nottheonion,not_removed,wrong im was an electronics technician reactor operator not petty officer tim
nottheonion,not_removed,really sad to be honest the reason i joined the navy is because of the traditions seeing this while growing up made me want to enlist now all i am in for is my sense of patriotism

nottheonion,not_removed,well that explains why hes an expert
nottheonion,not_removed,this isnt especially surprising when i moved from missouri to wisconsin the county was supposed to let my old county know about the move when i registered to vote but never bothered i only found out that i was still registered in missouri when i received a letter telling me i had been selected for jury duty it took several phone calls just to find out how to get my name off the missouri voter rolls im still not sure it worked
nottheonion,not_removed,so technically qualified
nottheonion,not_removed,he said found thousands of duplicate records and registrations of dead people voter fraud is rampant in the us and that voting by to million immigrants illegally in the country logic is hard so is math
nottheonion,not_removed,at this point it would be more surprising if he wasnt a hypocrite
nottheonion,not_removed,totally not true such an unfair report so unfair the dishonest media is attacking this tremendous expert because theyre hillary flakes sad
nottheonion,not_removed,is being registered in multiple states a crime he voted in one state why is this news
nottheonion,not_removed,research reasons im sure
nottheonion,not_removed,how clueless is the comment section right now being registered to vote voting if you live in a state by law youre allowed to register to vote that doesnt mean he voted on three separate occasions nor does it say he did there are dozens of articles on this shit
nottheonion,not_removed,its not illegal to be registered to vote in multiple states however it is if you vote in multiple states
nottheonion,not_removed,while funny theres nothing malicious about being registered in multiple states if youve voted in multiple states over the course of your life its entirely plausible that youre registered in more than one state id imagine trumps intention here is to paint being registered in multiple states as malicious so now he can use this as ammo to claim corruption and enact stricter voting laws lets not fall right into his hands
nottheonion,not_removed,clearly demonstrating himself as an expert
nottheonion,not_removed,oh you dont say
nottheonion,not_removed,i love his response well that just proves the system is broken i cannot believe the media has to put this crap science and sham social scientist up for review by the public
nottheonion,not_removed,im probably registered in two colorado and arizona lived in both places and never deregistered or anything
nottheonion,not_removed,its meaningless though and highlights the problems with right winger claims if you move there is zero law for you to inform your local district and its up to the state to clean the rolls now if he purposefully registered to vote at places while living at one yeah but otherwise simply moving is where most the double registrations come from so its the states problem they are the ones that need to clean the rolls but one more thing that makes this rediculous you know how we know that fucking trumper voted twice who only did so cause they wanted to test the system both sides know about the moving and dying thing and spend big fucking money looking for that shit its worth tons of money to the parties to win they check for people voting twice
nottheonion,not_removed,hmm i guess we should take a close look at voter registration systems
nottheonion,not_removed,being registered in multiple states although fishy is not illegal now lets check to see if he voted in multiple states
nottheonion,not_removed,look at james okeefe videos the dnc was caught undercover discussing voter fraud and committed voter fraud but no one here gives a shit youre losing your minds over guy
nottheonion,not_removed,i facepalmed sighed and shook my head all at the same time triple threat
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt this a sign that the voter registration system is a little fucked up im registered in four states only vote in one but it makes it very easy for someone else to vote under my name in another state
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess he knows what hes talking about then
nottheonion,not_removed,so do i have to unregister to vote if i move or something i assumed that was an automated thing as soon as i register elsewhere
nottheonion,not_removed,you cant make this shit up
nottheonion,not_removed,did he vote in three states
nottheonion,not_removed,which is legal
nottheonion,not_removed,life is so entertaining these last two weeks
nottheonion,not_removed,takes one to know one
nottheonion,not_removed,im no expert but i dont think this guys an expert
nottheonion,not_removed,well sure his voting fraud is what made him an expert in voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,i wish the news outlets would bring a secretary of state state not federal on air instead of the usual stable of talking heads it can be a gop one they will explain one of the outcomes of the election is they started running the rosters to see if people were double voting they do catch people and its usually concentrated in snow bird states like florida and arizona
nottheonion,not_removed,registered to vote but did it count as votes
nottheonion,not_removed,not an american do you have to register every election
nottheonion,not_removed,and over at rthedonald crickets lol jk its just more nasty women reeeeee
nottheonion,not_removed,but did they vote in all three states
nottheonion,not_removed,its legal to be registered in multiple states you just cant vote in multiple
nottheonion,not_removed,voters on the roles and voting not purely acts of fraud per se its whether or not the process by which votes were counted catches these problems thats always have and always will be problems the answer is yes they tend to catch them all by final tally or they disregard then is the margin of error is within the limits of mistakes made however during certification or recounts if the margin of error is too close then these are heavily flushed out matching voter roles across state lines counting oversees ballots they reopen the bad documents that get set aside until that time most states have a better process than ever to cross check hell thats where all this data comes from
nottheonion,not_removed,so totally proof of the premise of voter fraud good work guys
nottheonion,not_removed,fam i cant 😂😂😂
nottheonion,not_removed,mississippi records list him under the name gregg a phillips and that record includes the final four digits of phillips social security number his correct date of birth and a prior address matching one once attached to gregg allen phillips this is the scariest part that should get the focus a false ss that isnt a mistake its intentional fraud edit maybe i misinterpreted this maybe mississippi only records the last in which case it may be a careless oversight on this guys part still ironic if this kind of thing is what trump is calling out people on
nottheonion,not_removed,the trump administration is hypocritically and disingenuously ginning up fear about voter fraud in order to give the goahead for rampant voter suppression reduced voting sites days and hours and voter roll purges its already been happening in gopcontrolled states for years those of you upset about this should check out the voting rights march tinyccvotingrightsmarch
nottheonion,not_removed,this is not his fault hes lived in each of those states what happens and this is why we need to investigate voter fraud is that states dont follow their own laws to make sure that their voter lists are free of the deceased or those who have moved as a result joe fred bob could walk in claiming to be whoever and go ahead and vote in that name or that person could be aware of the loophole and go to previous states they lived in and vote there under their own name he would not have known whether his name is still on the list at those states or not because thats the states job to keep up with but they dont and thats why we have this issue the man did absolutely nothing wrong and its low of any media outlet to first say theres no evidence of fraud being an issue and then to pin a common problem out of any one citizens control on a man whos trying to help fix the problem instead of just nodding without knowing the whole of the issue you guys really should look into what voter fraud actually is and so should any news outlet pushing this crap narrative the only way it would have been wrong is for this guy to have been aware he was registered in three states and take advantage of it but he did neither
nottheonion,not_removed,woah woah woah this is rnottheonion not rpolitics this subreddit is only for ridiculous but real stories
nottheonion,not_removed,dump was right about voter fraud there were plenty of voter frauds in favor of him
nottheonion,not_removed,gotta be one to see one
nottheonion,not_removed,i registered in all of them and im dead hire me bannon
nottheonion,not_removed,he voted only in alabama in november records show how does it work exactly do you have to unregister if you move this seems like a nonissues
nottheonion,not_removed,trump did voter fraud better than hilary simple as that
nottheonion,not_removed,you can register in multiple states as long as you dont vote in all of them
nottheonion,not_removed,you cant make this shit up its not the onion because their writers arent that creative
nottheonion,not_removed,voter fraud expert was registered to vote in three states that check out
nottheonion,not_removed,you can be registered to vote in as many as you want its just a matter of actually voting in all three unlikely considering it was a single day to vote
nottheonion,not_removed,only theres states gotta catch em all missed opportunity
nottheonion,not_removed,look the man says crazy shit not even diehards disagree with that voter fraud happens plenty ive had this discussion with my buddy and he cited great sources about how it really doesnt happen blah blah blah those sources were factually accurate the truth behind that though is theres really no hard checking into that theres still no way its million thats batshit but this is how the dude does it ive not read the art of the deal however from what ive heard one major thing in there is you start your negotiations high now the number he picked sounds like hes high but if you want you start by saying you want so you can get your maybe even or my guess is that he wants to curb some election fraud and his way of doing that and investigate how to go about it is to overstate the problem by tldr i dunno read it or dont i dont give a shit
nottheonion,not_removed,what happened to the voter fraud doesnt exist argument
nottheonion,not_removed,awe its like watching an episode of game of thrones with the mad king
nottheonion,not_removed,the article reports that he voted in one state alabama someone at time just wanted this headline this isnt an issue report on important things please
nottheonion,not_removed,that makes him the perfect guy to lead this fight
nottheonion,not_removed,did he vote in three states edit no he voted only in alabama in november records show
nottheonion,not_removed,illegal aliens on the other hand are only registered in one state
nottheonion,not_removed,to catch a thief
nottheonion,not_removed,qualified fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,for research purposes only
nottheonion,not_removed,iirc it is not illegal to be registered to vote in multiple states but it is illegal to actually vote twice
nottheonion,not_removed,he only registered in three states to test our voting system s
nottheonion,not_removed,this is golden like a naked trump pissing all over his own reflection in a full size gilded mirror
nottheonion,not_removed,i am a military wife i am registered to vote in two states and it could have been three but i kept my old address after our last move i only voted once being registered in multiple places can just mean you have moved a few times
nottheonion,not_removed,thats what makes him an expert
nottheonion,not_removed,hahaha oh the hypocrisy
nottheonion,not_removed,okay no wait is this because he lived in states because thats pretty common only voted in alabama this november pack it in yall this is circlejerk bait
nottheonion,not_removed,you can be registered in multiple places you just cant vote in multiple places why is this so hard for you idiots to understand
nottheonion,not_removed,so i guess trump is correct
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess five wouldve made him voter fraud ace instead
nottheonion,not_removed,that makes him smart s
nottheonion,not_removed,he looks like an old martin skreli in this pic
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like he was in fact an expert he did say he would hire the highest qualified people to fill positions yet another campaign promise fulfilled by trump
nottheonion,not_removed,why is everything trump does just so wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,right because hes lived in texas his whole life are you people that fucking diluted im registered in ohio and indiana because i lived in indiana for a year are you people this fucking diluted
nottheonion,not_removed,oh god just like trump is an expert on tax evasion
nottheonion,not_removed,if only his education expert went to school
nottheonion,not_removed,i would expect an expert at baking to be a professional baker so why not
nottheonion,not_removed,so takes one to know one
nottheonion,not_removed,well that and the three penises penii
nottheonion,not_removed,was and is could be a whole different time line than whats presumed
nottheonion,not_removed,exactly he probably promised never to do it again pffff hahahahahahahahahahaha
nottheonion,not_removed,i think i might be registered in states i never unregistered from anything
nottheonion,not_removed,i just moved to seattle from missouri hello former fellow missourian i am still registered in mo and i just registered in wa
nottheonion,not_removed,you are entirely missing the point nobody says that he committed voter fraud but republicans for a long time including the new trump administration keep claiming massive amounts of voter fraud when pushed to give examples they always conflate ordinary run of the mill out of date voter registration entries that is the exact point of pointing out that he is registered to vote in three places to make it transparent that out of date or even fraudulent voter registration is an entirely separate issue from voter fraud which is also entirely separate from election fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,understandable youre not a voting fraud expert though i mean youre probably not are you
nottheonion,not_removed,states dont have jurisdiction over each other so they arent required to spend time and money informing another state that you moved there not to say they dont ever tell each other but when there isnt anything compelling them to you can assume they wont as for voterrolls a lot of people are misinformed and think it is just voter registration that they pull from for jury duty thats not true anymore pretty much any interaction with state government where you put down your name puts you on the list not saying you werent picked by registration list just adding that it doesnt work the way a lot of people think anymore some people actually avoid registering to vote due to this misinformation it doesnt prevent you from getting on the list anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,same here
nottheonion,not_removed,shhhhh your being logical and your comment does not match reddit masses agenda
nottheonion,not_removed,yep he lived in those places and only voted in one place more fake news and shows why they need to investigate and reform our voting system
nottheonion,not_removed,the best kind of qualified
nottheonion,not_removed,the most qualified person on trumps staff in fact
nottheonion,not_removed,well there is so much wrong with this it isnt even funny duplicate records doesnt equal illegal immigrants duplicate records doesnt mean they voted whose to say they didnt vote for trump if they existed yeah yeah yeah hispanics went for hilary except trump brags he got more hispanics than romney very odd
nottheonion,not_removed,so dead people are illegal immigrants by your logic
nottheonion,not_removed,not really if you get a drivers license which you dont need to be a citizen the dmv asks you if youd like to be registered to vote they are not allowed by law to ask if youre a citizen
nottheonion,not_removed,thats not hypocritical it would be hypocritical if he did commit voter fraud which he may have or may have not we dont know however with innocent until proven guilty he should be presumed innocent this is as hypocritical as a gunowning police man investigating a mass shooting
nottheonion,not_removed,the thing i hate the most about the way he talks is that he tells people exactly how they should feel at the end of his sentences disgraceful
nottheonion,not_removed,its not a crime but trump has called being registered in multiple states voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,because he and trump have claimed that people registered in multiple states means that they are performing voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,one of the reasons trump claims there is wide spread voter fraud is because people who are dead or moved to different states are still on the voter registers he specifically went after the idea that people on multiple lists are voting more than once even though there hasnt been proof he also claims that all fake votes were cast against himl and that he really won the popular vote also it seems as if he is mainly targeting blue states that have democratic governors
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a part of what trump is using as an example of rampant voter fraud soi guess it doesnt matter unless youre brown or something
nottheonion,not_removed,because i heard he voted million times a lot of people believe that
nottheonion,not_removed,its only news because trump is complaining about people who are registered in multiple states linking it to voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,mississippi records list him under the name gregg a phillips and that record includes the final four digits of phillips social security number his correct date of birth and a prior address matching one once attached to gregg allen phillips the guy is either intentionally registering fraudulently or so inept that he cant get his own ssn right on a form either way its corruption or incompetence neither of which is a great trait in a presidential appointee
nottheonion,not_removed,its not a crime trump said it was a crime
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know why this isnt top comment it isnt a crime or fraud to be registered in multiple states it happens when people relocate it becomes a crime when someone actually attempts to vote more than once i dont understand how this is news
nottheonion,not_removed,i think im registered in az ca maybe soon in ut
nottheonion,not_removed,yes its difficult to police voter fraud accurately without a nationwide id system also there is a history of using difficult processes to suppress minority voting one mans fair count is anothers plot to disenfranchise a group im in the middle we should be required to show a government id with a picture and an address to vote but no national id
nottheonion,not_removed,it usually is but judging by the rest of the comments a lot of the time theyre just too lazy to actually let your old place know
nottheonion,not_removed,each state maintains separate voter rolls and they dont always talk to each other
nottheonion,not_removed,you dont have to you should if you like keeping your affairs in order and it isnt all that automatic sometimes it is but its a low priority bureaucratic process that involves having channels of communication between every voting district people who move are often registered in places for some time but they almost never vote twice since its a major fucking felony that you get almost nothing out of so no one was losing that much sleep over how quickly old records were corrected until trump needed a narrative
nottheonion,not_removed,except as literally everyone else is pointing out trump and his droogs use multiple state registration as proof of voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,you are missing the point of this this notes the hypocrisy of trump and his so called expert on voter fraud trump is the one who claimed people registered in multiple states are the ones committing fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,no
nottheonion,not_removed,too bad donald trump doesnt understand that
nottheonion,not_removed,and wouldnt be an issue were it not that dtrizzle specifically called it out as a sign of voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,actually it depends on the states for some it is illegal to be registered in multiple states
nottheonion,not_removed,but that is not voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,no but you must vote where you are registered unfortunately the media is grasping for anything and everything that may be used against this admin if it turns out that he voted multiple times then it would be voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,total non issue just gotta jump on the anti trump bandwagon and reason and logic dont matter
nottheonion,not_removed,thats not why this is being brought up its because trumps proof that voter fraud is happening is because people are registered in multiple states
nottheonion,not_removed,trump is saying being registered in two states is voter fraud in itself you idiot
nottheonion,not_removed,its trump that doesnt understand this pretty sure the majority of people here understand that just trying to highlight the hypocrisy of trumps comments
nottheonion,not_removed,in his first days in the oval office mr trump has renewed his complaint that millions of people voted illegally depriving him of a popularvote majority in two twitter posts early wednesday morning the president vowed to open an inquiry to reveal people who are registered to vote in multiple states or who remain on voting rolls long after they have died no one said it was but it is a primary characteristic trump planned to search for anyway in his witch hunt to signal potential fraud should such indicators of fraud only raise suspicions when they occur on the left
nottheonion,not_removed,you should inform trump of that
nottheonion,not_removed,exactly please let trump know let kris kobach know let fox news know that is the fucking point and you missed it genius
nottheonion,not_removed,trump said himself being registered in two states is voter fraud you idiot
nottheonion,not_removed,i am diluted with vodka
nottheonion,not_removed,clown drumph taking the high road i see
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt drumph his mothers maiden name or something like that if so why is it even a thing
nottheonion,not_removed,that makes him smart
nottheonion,not_removed,or when obamas treasure secretary forgot to pay taxes
nottheonion,not_removed,if the feds wanted to take million of million someones earned best believe any sane person would use any loophole they could to avoid government theft
nottheonion,not_removed,that makes her smart she used education evasion
nottheonion,not_removed,he evaded school duh
nottheonion,not_removed,i believe you mean cooking
nottheonion,not_removed,and the results of the experiment depend on whether you count being found out and shamed by millions as a failure
nottheonion,not_removed,well its not illegal to be registered in multiple states just dont vote in multiple states
nottheonion,not_removed,i think i might still be a member of blockbuster video
nottheonion,not_removed,hey i made that same journey years ago from ladue to belltown what brings you to seattle
nottheonion,not_removed,or they might use year ago numbers as current number compare to this years number showing more people voted then there are
nottheonion,not_removed,understandable but he didnt do anything wrong whats there to understand
nottheonion,not_removed,only the most technically hence best qualified shall be a part of the trump admin
nottheonion,not_removed,you think the nazis cared about the facts when they took power no they just spewed out a bunch of bullshit excuses exactly like this as a reason to do what they wanted to do then they steamrolled over anyone that bothered to argue the facts waste your time arguing this stuff like they want you to in the meantime theyll be moving forward with lots of stuff because no one in the gop controlled government wants to stop them
nottheonion,not_removed,deleted
nottheonion,not_removed,no its hypocritical because he cites people registered in multiple states in his possible voter fraud evidence
nottheonion,not_removed,its hypocritical since donald was complaining about people registered in multiple states as evidence of voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,no youre the troll youre the troll
nottheonion,not_removed,obviously
nottheonion,not_removed,damn after looking at this i just realize trump had been doing this for a long time happy
nottheonion,not_removed,but only when people who arent on his side do it its also voter fraud to him to exist and not support him
nottheonion,not_removed,so hes using the same tactics he talks about in his books to get people to keep talking about this
nottheonion,not_removed,it is more complex than that you move and register to vote somewhere else but your original voter registration is still valid especially across state lines now the simple thing is for the real person to vote in multiple places the real threat is that people harvest these orphan voter registrations with mail ballots being sent out to all voters in some states it is pretty easy to go to places with a lot of transient population and get ballots or just actually go and vote under someones name
nottheonion,not_removed,youre lying you know why its news trump has said over million fraudulent votes were cast all against him and his only proof is that a handful of people are registered in multiple states its the same bullshit they used to purge valid votes in michigan stop fucking lying
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah as a high level politician you probably move around quite a bit i imagine with the money they make off corporations buying their votes they go through quite a few states and end up registered for quite a few its only illegal if you vote in more than one
nottheonion,not_removed,same i just vote in one though its not illegal to be registered in many just cant vote more than once
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks for your measured response im in the same middleground boat have a good one
nottheonion,not_removed,according to trump it is
nottheonion,not_removed,its alternative voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,except for the fact that it has nothing to do with the actual voter fraud that is occurring trigglypuff
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,you are more diluted than grocery store vodka
nottheonion,not_removed,ive never understood this literal name calling trump makes lefties literally insane
nottheonion,not_removed,im open to other suggestions its not like im set on that one
nottheonion,not_removed,he made fun of john stewart for not keeping his original jewish sounding last name it just so happened to come out a day or two later that trumps family also changed their names for nearly identical reasons drumpf being the original hence why its stuck people arent just mocking his maiden name they are mocking his outcry for mocking others about name changes
nottheonion,not_removed,it was a bit on john olivers show last week tonight from last years series apparently trump once criticized john stewart who was olivers former boss on the daily show for changing his name from jonathan leibowitz to johnathan stewart saying he should be proud of his heritage however according to a biography trumps family name was changed when his ancestors immigrated to america originally it was pronounced the same but spelled drumpf john oliver shot trumps criticism right back at him and tried to twist the knife by getting the hashtag makedonalddrumpfagain to trend it worked somewhat but people wont really let that one go same with the tiny hands comment that tends to float around its also not like donald trump changed his own name one of his family members farther back down the line did so the criticism doest really apply to him he has always been donald trump anyway thats the origin
nottheonion,not_removed,the family name was originally drumpf before it was americanized to trump his mother was an immigrant from scotland
nottheonion,not_removed,wicked smaht pro strat never pay out on deals because you got enough money from your daddy to do so
nottheonion,not_removed,being registered in multiple states is not the problem its only when you go ahead and vote multiple times in different states nobody cares if your registered in multiple states its just the first thing you look for for possible voter fraud i know this doesnt fit reddits narrative so continue on with the witch hunt
nottheonion,not_removed,obamas treasure secretary i bet he has an eyepatch arrrrr
nottheonion,not_removed,that was because he used turbotax
nottheonion,not_removed,no he meant baking
nottheonion,not_removed,did the voter fraud expert vote in multiple states
nottheonion,not_removed,uhm this goes against the narrative so im downvoting
nottheonion,not_removed,so did he actually give any proof of this happening
nottheonion,not_removed,clayton to cap hill i grew up sailing on small lakes in the mid west and found skiingsnowboarding and mountain climbing decided id go to a place that has all of it thats seattle just signed with a new firm and excited to explore all that seattle is ladue is beautiful i feel ladue when im in leschi madrona madison park
nottheonion,not_removed,the bureaucratic mix up
nottheonion,not_removed,which it is
nottheonion,not_removed,did he mean people who registered and also voted in multiple states
nottheonion,not_removed,its because when you tell people how to feel they dont have to think about why they should feel that way insightful
nottheonion,not_removed,serious questioncan you expand on the tactics he talked about in his book ive never read one
nottheonion,not_removed,what tactics i should read the book just so i can know the guys tricks better
nottheonion,not_removed,im also interested keeping this tab open patiently
nottheonion,not_removed,fine prove it because something is possible doesnt mean it happens it is possible that every member of the nra decides to shoot a child tomorrow but it wont happen surely if it was a large problem then there must be a few who slip up and get caught right say of screw up there still should be illegal aliens who got caught voting kris kobach the secretary of state for kansas ran on a get tough on voter fraud identity he lobbied for and received special privileges to prosecute these cases how many cases did he uncover in all of kanas four none were illegal immigrants all were old men not part of any payforvotes scheme just confused you think that would humble kobach nope he has trumps ear and backed up trumps assertion that there is rampant voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,er
nottheonion,not_removed,the wording was ambiguous it could mean that he was registered under a different ssn with the last being the same but not the others or it could mean that the last are all that is recorded if the is correct i stand by by statement if the is correct it was sloppy writingediting in the article but i agree it was not really anything he did however the fact that trump is the one saying that multiplestate registration is fraud and the numbers he is throwing around probably include this guy and many with identical situations is pretty ironic no matter what now i am going to assume that you are of the right leaning persuasion and maybe support trump how would you balance the states rights to make their own laws and regulations with the discrepancies that you note do you suggest more federal regulation in this area that happens to possibly benefit your party genuinely curious
nottheonion,not_removed,trump doesnt know shit its still not voter fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,good comeback nice support way to convince people how about telling us why trump believes there is massive voter fraud and no voter fraud prosecutions in fact seraphite is exactly right republicans have been for years conflating stale voter data with fraud when my dad died of a stroke the last thing we had on our mind was tracking down which agency to contact to let them know he wont be voting anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,good trump impression i read it in his voice from the debates
nottheonion,not_removed,where is that voter fraud happening why isnt anyone being prosecuted for it are you claiming that million illegal votes were cast and nobody got caught doing it if you can find one tenth of one percent of that tally ill donate to the charity of your choice or the rnc for that matter
nottheonion,not_removed,i am more diluted than bathtub vodka
nottheonion,not_removed,when someone name calls it is because they have nothing better to say either they are inarticulate or there is no substance to their argument
nottheonion,not_removed,how about bigslapandpickle
nottheonion,not_removed,i read this as mark wahlberg
nottheonion,not_removed,trump was never given just a million dollars he was giving a business name because his father acquired bad term with others then he changed the company into what it is today
nottheonion,not_removed,i know this doesnt fit reddits narrative so continue on with the witch hunt well that got briny
nottheonion,not_removed,being registered in multiple states is not the problem its only when you go ahead and vote multiple times in different states this is true the issue is that the gop has been slandering democrats for voter fraud and have been pushing for programs to prevent voter fraud by finding people who may be registered in multiple states the issue once again is hypocrisy
nottheonion,not_removed,the guy wanted to insert his politics so bad he didnt even stop to think so it made sense sounds about right
nottheonion,not_removed,are you ready kids
nottheonion,not_removed,yoohoo
nottheonion,not_removed,fair enough
nottheonion,not_removed,who knows the point i believe is that trump felt being registered in multiple states might be voter fraud which if you dont vote in multiple states it isnt so this is more an egg on his face thing
nottheonion,not_removed,article states he voted in one
nottheonion,not_removed,most likely not its not worth the effort
nottheonion,not_removed,if youre too stupid to understand the narrative you should probably just not comment on it when you look at the people that are registered dead illegal and two states and some cases maybe three states we have a lot to look into dumbass fucking mentally challenged dj drumpf
nottheonion,not_removed,you have people all people
nottheonion,not_removed,the hamburgers right
nottheonion,not_removed,you nasty
nottheonion,not_removed,its hypocritical because of the way it is
nottheonion,not_removed,sorry yes she is just joking
nottheonion,not_removed,there may be a lot of people with that disposition but i doubt anyone talks that way without intentionally mocking the man himself
nottheonion,not_removed,he may be an unethical piece of human shit but he knows his audience this country has millions of people who are so stupid that they literally need to be instructed how to feel how can i take advantage of this
nottheonion,not_removed,hes a professional media whore so he says overthetop crap to draw attention to something and keep it in the spot light i want to say that this was in the art of the deal book but without calling himself a media whore
nottheonion,not_removed,nobody is trying to steal kansas i was just trying to point out the real path for voter fraud people moving from state to state to try to get multiple votes isnt how it is manipulated
nottheonion,not_removed,you should get some sleep
nottheonion,not_removed,then get your wallet ready vote fraud investigation is coming take your pick httpwwwtrumpcomcharities
nottheonion,not_removed,shut up you nazi
nottheonion,not_removed,edit the last transformers movie to be trump vs mark wahlberg starring as the and you go it
nottheonion,not_removed,changed it from a semisuccessful business to a failing one like magic
nottheonion,not_removed,my bad hard to argue reddit isnt a giant circle jerk for the left at this point so much for equality of opinion
nottheonion,not_removed,you start by finding people who registered in multiple states and then you investigate farther you are inflating his words once again the problem is voting illegally is not really that hard if youre doing it very intelligently heres obama inciting illegal voting but maybe im just inflating his words httpsyoutubetwfjwkuputq
nottheonion,not_removed,so bad so hard
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty sure that isnt what trump is investigating hope you realize that youre reading fake news
nottheonion,not_removed,dicks drive thru is delicious
nottheonion,not_removed,its a drive thru i expect downvotes their loss yummm
nottheonion,not_removed,so he appoints this guy to investigate voter fraud bc hes registered in three states opposed to someone who is registered in one this is done bc he knows the media will talk about this am i following the logic correctly
nottheonion,not_removed,i think it was if i stole the election how to get away with anything by changing the topic to hillary clinton by dj drumpf
nottheonion,not_removed,nobody is trying to steal kansas but kobach explicitly claimed there was and still continues to claim it is rampant ok so your theory is that it doesnt happen in kansas presumably because it was reliably red but by the same reasoning it isnt going to happen in any reliably red state nor will it happen in reliably blue states so most of those million illegal immigrant voters voted in swing state is that your claim just where do you think those voters are located also what is your explanation for why would an illegal immigrant risk getting arrested for voting
nottheonion,not_removed,pm me when it happens im serious in the meantime i wont be losing any sleep to be clear by fraud i mean an illegal immigrant going to a voting booth and actually voting not just a name appearing on a paper i also dont mean charges of fraud i mean proven fraud in past such claims many of the proven fraud claims were subsequently tossed out for example john miller voted twice turned out to be two different john millers often father and son they shared an address which led to the claim of double voting
nottheonion,not_removed,actually in the early it was extremely more successful then his father his father was buying and flipping houses and he ended up screwing up some big relationships and losing credibility the company was failing and then he gave it to donald and he became ceo of the board donald had a different outtake for what he wanted the company to be theres a very unbiased youtube video of i can find it ill edit in a link
nottheonion,not_removed,ok real talk what do you think of this do you truly believe that million people voted illegally i just want to understand how this is left vs right i understand that reddit is left leaning a lot of the time but these claims call into question the very foundation of a democratic society trump won so why is it so important that he won the popular vote the last republican elected also lost the popular vote and he got years theres something else at play here and i want to understand your perspective honest if youd prefer to discuss in pm im ok with that as well i just really want to understand how people who support this illegal vote thing see it
nottheonion,not_removed,you start by finding people who registered in multiple states and then you investigate farther sure thats great investigate further ask any flagged people what state they intend to vote in and remove them from the other states the issue is that a program that uses this data
nottheonion,not_removed,im not going to find it but trump has specifically called out multiple registrations in his tweets as examples of the problem as he sees it along with illegals voting the dead voting etc if his own twitter account is now fake news well then i dont know what to believe edit to clarify re fake news i would consider his twitter account a reliable source for what he has donesaid regardless of whether what he is saying is actually true two different issues there
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty sure he specifically mentioned this i have no idea what fake news youre talking about
nottheonion,not_removed,colorado north carolina georgia to name a few swingish states with large illegal populations the isnt a made up number iirc it comes from pollingquestionnaires of voters and how many claimed to be illegal ive lived in four states in the last years and i cant remember registering to vote in any of them that is how hard it is to vote i get mail ballots in my current state anyone that says it is a burden to register and vote or it is too hard is a liar my overseas friends laugh at the lax voting over here my italian friend has to get a registration letter to vote in every election and bring an id and vote only on voting day no mail in or extended voting no voting letter no id show up any other day fughedaboutit an illegal risk voting risk is a pretty strong word but cash money would be one register to vote put your address in as at large apartment complex and the mail in ballots can be harvested
nottheonion,not_removed,well semisuccessful while it lasted in the early days but pretty soon he might have to fire bomb it
nottheonion,not_removed,i believe there is voter fraud going on in many states and nobody knows how many actually vote illegally i welcome any investigation and a better voting system to ensure that fraud and hacking into our election process is no longer possible video of obama inciting illegal voting himself days before the election below httpsyoutubetwfjwkuputq i think its less about trumps thin skin and ego and more of a way to issue voter id or some other way to secure the system honestly i dont even know whats going on anymore the left has been taken over by rioters sjws blm and various other forms of communism but i dont know the exact term im looking for even classical liberals that would fall on the left are feeling pushed away for not hating white men enough or not believing in the patriarchy that has enslaved all colored people the right is divided as well between the altright and classical conservatives but have found themselves in great political power across the nation except on the well populated coasts there isnt much outrage here obviously and have been sitting quiet as the left spins out of control the of media being leftliberal reddit included are only fueling the fire on racial division and ignoring whats going on with europe sweden finland germany for example are greatly regretting the mixing of foreign cultures who do not mix within their society its mostly young muslim men who cant assimilate and rape steal assault i dont know the answer anymore and not very good at speaking my mind in a kind generous manner i and many other conservatives are only trying to look out for the best interests of america and its christian values im an atheist now but believe the values are very important to keep society in check without them we are just animals roaming the streets demanding free handouts and social justice for anyone in the world that needs help we have to be smart in such times of turmoil modern sweden what the media wont cover its happening all over europe httpsyoutubemnbdvoxegy
nottheonion,not_removed,hes probably talking about tldr republicans have been pushing a crosscheck program for the last few years that catches potential voter fraudsters specifically by finding people who may be registered to vote in multiple states because they think people standing in line for hours then going to the airport and flying to another state to stand in another line for hours to vote again is some huge problem that this might fix
nottheonion,not_removed,the figure comes in large part from a study which it is claimed says that of illegal aliens have voted but the author of the study said that is not what his paper said and specifically said that actual voter fraud is nearly zero it does happen but it is rare eg four cases in all of kansas
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree
nottheonion,not_removed,thank you for the response i think its important to understand how people whos opinions differ from yours reason though their arguments
nottheonion,not_removed,you are referring to the pew study which is different than the dominion univ based one and ill save you the ink i know youll have problems with that one too the key thing that im trying to point out is that the system is ripe for corruption and considering the money that goes into just potus campaigns there is a lot of incentive to stack the deck that and the image of people voting multiple times or illegals showing up to vote is not the most likely and most productive way to tilt the vote considering that there is almost not downside to actual truing the vote the insistence of keeping it sloppy is enough make people wonder why it is left open to corruption
nottheonion,not_removed,this is an agreement
nottheonion,not_removed,one problem is that republicans arent claiming we are at risk of voter fraud they claim that it happens on a massive scale right now that is a very different thing if someone showed that there was large scale voter fraud id be against it and so would everyone else but it not only hasnt it been shown to be happening it has been shown to be extremely rare do you agree with trump that million illegal votes were cast much less million illegal alien votes if so why are we quibbling about potential fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,i think the issue may be as simple as how people view things i see a system that is on its face extremely simple to game and when you look at the money spent on changing voters minds it would be far easier to just change ballots i do like how you split out fraud from illegal voting though i think of them in the same box i see a system that for no reason is open to attack and the party of bigger govt and solutions for some reason cant seem to come up with a program to fix it when there is always a program if not more than one to fix anything oddly the idea that poor minority people cant figure out to vote is inherently more racist than the idea making sure the votes cast are legitimate as much as there is a lack of evidence that there is large scale fraud there is no evidence that the minimal controls that we place on voting are keeping people from voting i just see a system that is open to subterfuge on the voting side and that doesnt even start to talk about the voting machine issues that every side is leary and if we do go to a straight pop vote the incentive to cheat anyplace you can goes up even more thanks for the conversation
nottheonion,not_removed,even though i disagree with you i continue to upvote your comments for carrying on this conversation civilly it is quite refreshing thanks too for the conversation i do like how you split out fraud from illegal voting this isnt my terminology these are widely recognized different categories registration fraud this is different than stale voter info im sure youve seen get out the vote campaigns say people at a mall urging passersby to sign up or people going door to door trying to sign people up some of these people are paid and not well and they themselves fill out hundreds of voter forms to make it look like they are doing work or people who fill them out think it is a great gag to sign up as mick e mouse needless to say mick e mouse doesnt actually show up to vote voter fraud an individual voter votes multiple times or votes under a false identity election fraud fraud that happens after the vote eg a voting center throwing away ballots intentionally miscounting ballots or tampering with voting machines you say it would be easy to game the system and there are incentives to do so the fact that there is only trivial amounts of voter fraud should lead you to ask yourself well then why isnt it happening perhaps there are disincentives you dont recognize for instance people who are registered in multiple states nearly always because theyve moved could vote twice on election day either theyd have to travel between states in order to cast a vote twice unlikely for something which individually is so unlikely to make the difference or theyd have to find someone willing to break the law and who is willing to get fake id to do it even if they managed to cast a ballot twice on that day voter rolls are cross checked im not sure if comprehensively or statistically to find cheaters if found out the penalties are high these things are enough to prevent most vote fraud there is no evidence that the minimal controls that we place on voting are keeping people from voting ok say it really is trivial to get id there is no reason why someone couldnt get one say im registered in ny and nj why cant i vote in both states with my id either the id didnt fix the problem or they already have ways of checking for duplicate votes you cant simultaneously claim that lack of an id keeps some people from voting but also say it is trivial to get around it i mean you can say it but it isnt coherent oh it is so easy anyone can go to the dmv and get a voter id there is no reason someone cant do that if you havent experienced it yourself im sure you have heard people complain how they went to the department of motor vehicles or whatever it is called in your state and complained how it took hours or they had to come back multiple times just to do something simple like renew a drivers license or do a change of address i am a salaried worker with flexible work hours so such things are irritating when they happen to me but nothing more than inconvenient if you are a low wage worker or very old or ill it is harder to put up with if you work at mcdonalds the boss isnt going to let you off for a few hours to go to the dmv and asking for a second or third is not likely either i live in texas student id even with a photo is not a valid voter id gun permits are however there are a lot of students who are not going to take a day off class to find the dmv so they can vote a few months from now hell most students put off writing term papers until the day before oddly the idea that poor minority people cant figure out to vote is inherently more racist than the idea making sure the votes cast are legitimate nobody is saying minorities are too stupid to figure out how to vote im sure people on the right are saying people on the left are saying it but that doesnt make it true people who are recent immigrants might have difficulty due to language and cultural differences but that is a separate matter

nottheonion,not_removed,birds live in trees how many bird skeletons have you seen in a tree but now that ive quoted the first website on google search ill also quote its answer to your question the cats cannot climb down as easily as they climb up and it can be impossible if the trees diameter is too wide most cats work it out on their own but not every cat does which is why a rescue is sometimes necessary

nottheonion,not_removed,this isnt an onionesque headline not at all
nottheonion,not_removed,how is this funny
nottheonion,not_removed,now that is an oniony headline
nottheonion,not_removed,sorry for a second i thought i was on ractuallytheonion edit huh so thats an actual subreddit
nottheonion,not_removed,man the internet sure has complicated opinions about taylor swift
nottheonion,not_removed,that should fail too just like all her relationships
nottheonion,not_removed,included in this article we dont have to listen to their illinformed manipulative conspiracy rumblings we have dudes on reddit now
nottheonion,not_removed,id watch the hell out of that channel
nottheonion,not_removed,long have we lingered here in the morally crepuscular fecklessly introspective jackoffliberal haze of televisions socalled golden age but here comes the smiling southernaccented sun of the dawning blonde age a new epoch in which we might all come home from a hard day at the racist meme factories and relax not with relentless handwringing but rather the ceaseless cheer provided by the pure aryan goddess swift so beloved by the hip alternative white supremacists that as broadly reported earlier this year believe its an established fact that taylor swift is secretly a nazi and is simply waiting for the time when donald trump makes it safe for her to come out and announce her aryan agenda to the world probably she will be betrothed to trumps son and they will be crowned american royalty actual quote from the article i kid you not
nottheonion,not_removed,what else is going to happen
nottheonion,not_removed,no what will i do without fox news
nottheonion,not_removed,why listen to people you think are wrong when you can just listen to pop music
nottheonion,not_removed,if you dont watch what we give you well shove taylor swift down your throats fast forward to and that children is how the indomitable reign of television crashed to a halt overnight
nottheonion,not_removed,i heard about this on the radio this morning i couldnt believe it lol good for her
nottheonion,not_removed,oh no this is not accurate or healthy
nottheonion,not_removed,taylor swift is and always will be a massive uninteresting cunt
nottheonion,not_removed,av club is the onion
nottheonion,not_removed,av club is a subsidiary of the onion and this article was written by their snarkiest writer

nottheonion,not_removed,the feelings in my penis are never complicated
nottheonion,not_removed,and then she will write a song about it
nottheonion,not_removed,catty much
nottheonion,not_removed,how many people read that far in the article let alone the article guess they were desperate to get that word count up
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like theyre copying the i shart radio forumula thats ruined most of the fm band for listenability
nottheonion,not_removed,oh no you said her name times rip in piece seepandra
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a little misleading it is a subsidiary but they are independent publications and the content is not generally satirical on the other handthe snark is real haha
nottheonion,not_removed,your penis doesnt have ears so forgiven
nottheonion,not_removed,and make millions
nottheonion,not_removed,between siriusxm spotify and apple music i honestly cant remember the last time i listened to terrestrial radio
nottheonion,not_removed,youre right i wasnt meaning to imply avc was satirical just that their sensibilities and styles are often similar because of that connection

nottheonion,not_removed,i imagine some mexicans are going to think this same thing and vote trump
nottheonion,not_removed,newer immigrants compete with older immigrants for limited work makes perfect sense for older immigrants to oppose it
nottheonion,not_removed,when i find a country that has no immigrants in it i swear im going to move there
nottheonion,not_removed,this is common no ones happy when a bunch of people come in and make it harder to work
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,arent they all great british
nottheonion,not_removed,im not sure the older immigrants want to work a day at costa or work sorting through all our recycling
nottheonion,not_removed,this effect was actually shown in a recent study and is usually overlooked when the effects of immigration are discussed negative effects on wages for existing residents caused by an influx of immigration are most prominently felt by preexisting immigrants not the native population
nottheonion,not_removed,thats true but personally i think its immigrants of certain skin colours and cultures hes talking about not of certain ages i believe that he likely doesnt even consider himself an immigrant because hes white
nottheonion,not_removed,you play by the rules spend a decade worming through a ridiculous system to do it legally then some asshole comes in breaks the law and gets in scot free no problem that wouldnt piss you off
nottheonion,not_removed,japan
nottheonion,not_removed,haha fuck poor people
nottheonion,not_removed,in case youre not being sarcastic no great britain is the other island containing england scotland and wales ireland is across the irish sea from great britain and contains the republic of ireland and northern ireland
nottheonion,not_removed,this guy probably doesnt give a crap about ideology
nottheonion,not_removed,no one wants to do shit jobs but if thats their only means of supporting themselves you bet your ass they will oppose competition for that job
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe shit jobs should have their worker supply dried up so that their wages will be adjusted
nottheonion,not_removed,in britain irish people are not really thought of as immigrants the average brit knows in their head that the republic of ireland is another country but i think that they still feel that it is part of their kingdom its possible he doesnt consider himself an immigrant because hes lived half his life in a place where most of the locals dont consider him an immigrant at least no more an immigrant than someone from scotland or wales of course i think hes a gobshite but i can see how he might have developed his gobshite views
nottheonion,not_removed,i just did a whole report on this for one of my classes but the funny thing about immigrants in japan is that a good portion of them are foreignborn japanese these are the childrengrandchildren of japanese emigrés during the eoj era and post wwii most of them grew up in latin america and especially brazil and speak very little to no japanese yet they are considered racially japanese and not immigrants so the government doesnt count them as foreigners in their statistics
nottheonion,not_removed,ive actually heard china is low but japan sounds nice
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks im american and somehow thought that all four countries made up great britain maybe they used to twenty years ago
nottheonion,not_removed,nope borders topography are pretty well established at least in europe ireland has been british in the sense that it was part of the colonial possessions of the british crown but it was never part of great britain

nottheonion,not_removed,small town in ny i asked the fire department if they would burn down my house so they could practice on it they agreed still leaves a mess afterwards to clean not everything just burns to ash but at least its down
nottheonion,not_removed,sometimes you can get the fire department to burn something down as training but you need to arrange it with them first be prepared they might not want training
nottheonion,not_removed,the department would have burned the house for him as a training exercise what a cool idea that is
nottheonion,not_removed,my bil did this to an old house on his farm the fire department was not involved
nottheonion,not_removed,i found this on the weebs however if you are not in control of the fire and did not obtain the necessary authorization you may be charged with criminally endangering your neighbors andor the public soirce he is an arsonist now he hasnt done anything wrong in years he is like the sergio ramos of the criminals now he scored a crime in the end of the game edit add some piece of info
nottheonion,not_removed,id say burning down several hundred hours of back breaking work is indeed a bad idea especially if it serves a vital purpose but if its one of those fraudulent foreclosures the banks love doing i would napalm the house and wreck the foundation
nottheonion,not_removed,the government is in the business of confiscating your rights and selling them back to you think of that every time you must buy a permit the government is permitting you
nottheonion,not_removed,facepalm
nottheonion,not_removed,arson is a crime
nottheonion,not_removed,but at least its down sounds like the practice session didnt go well then edit okay i read your other comment that they relit it multiple times to keep practicing
nottheonion,not_removed,insurance
nottheonion,not_removed,found the commenter who didnt read the article
nottheonion,not_removed,we regularly have live burns for training our volunteer fire department
nottheonion,not_removed,but if its a junker house that would cost more to repair than replace it would seem knocking it down or burning it down would be the easiest way to clear the land its like saying a totaled car should be repaired because it took a lot of work to build it in the first place
nottheonion,not_removed,most houses that get demolished are more expensive to repair than just rebuild it happens for instance if the house ends up with too bad of a mold problem or the wood is going bad this can be a better call you can just be endlessly repairing something otherwise just starting over can be better one of those fraudulent foreclosures the banks love doing if you burn down such a house youre committing arson and can go to prison for a very long time
nottheonion,not_removed,uh yeah of course they are thats the whole basis of the social contract i get to live in a society that protects me from animals and other humans and gives me opportunities to live in luxury and in return i follow whatever rules that society sets out
nottheonion,not_removed,arson might be a crime but the real crime here is your attitude pal
nottheonion,not_removed,arson doesnt apply but enjoy your participation trophy
nottheonion,not_removed,is it still a crime if you do it on your own house when theres nobody in there
nottheonion,not_removed,nope house was in terrible shape sat on the land for years would be too much to fix it up easier to demolish it burn it down and replace it
nottheonion,not_removed,insurnace is pretty clear that deliberate acts including donating a house for a fire department to burn would not be covered what exactly are you asking about insurnace
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah i knew fire departments trained it just never would have occurred to me to suggest that as a way of getting rid of an unwanted building
nottheonion,not_removed,whos to say the fire was intentional could be an electrical problem lol
nottheonion,not_removed,well it says that the owner may be facing criminal charges now
nottheonion,not_removed,i looked at a piece of land with an old home house was worthless but the land was in an area that would appreciate only problem asbestos siding to remove and dispose of plus state and county permits i declined as the state had recently stopped the grant program for asbestos removal land sold about a month later and by the darnest luck the house burns to the ground i felt terrible for the neighbors and the local sheriff never did look into what was obviously the new owner torching the place instead of paying to have the stuff safely removed
nottheonion,not_removed,as i understood it it has nothing to do with insurance he just wanted to get rid of the house burning it down makes a lot less waste than demolition
nottheonion,not_removed,ah the joys of asbestos that guy is an asshole for doing that worse he probably didnt warn the people who had to clean up the mess afterwards that there was asbestos in there
nottheonion,not_removed,im glad mine was a small small town in the country volunteer fire department they really liked the fire and practice putting it out good training for them i think they must have torched it like times probably why there was a lot left at the end since they didnt just stand around and watch it burn down
nottheonion,not_removed,its not the first time manning has faced the possibility of indefinite solitary confinement last year she was tried on charges of disorderly conduct for sweeping food onto the floor and medicine misuse for having an expired tube of toothpaste man fuck everything about this
nottheonion,not_removed,this is the kind of treatment id expect to hear of from some crazy middle eastern dictatorship like saudi arabia or iran but the us fuck me
nottheonion,not_removed,army officials quickly returned manning from the hospital to the allmale us disciplinary barracks in fort leavenworth kansas where she is currently serving a sentence ignoring for a few seconds that its not allmale if it houses chelsea manning why is she in an otherwise male prison isnt that cruel and particularly dangerous do they not have female facilities that can accommodate her
nottheonion,not_removed,it almost seems as if they actually want her to kill herself so they can wash their hands of the matter once and for all
nottheonion,not_removed,a true american hero i hope she is pardoned soon
nottheonion,not_removed,this sounds a bit like burset in the shu in orange is the new black this is awful
nottheonion,not_removed,her new name will be reek
nottheonion,not_removed,a suicide attempt is conduct which threatens threatening as in putting someone in danger to whom aside from chelsea herself
nottheonion,not_removed,gary johnson is the only person saying he might pardon her so there is something you can do to help
nottheonion,not_removed,lol i red it as face changes lmao
nottheonion,not_removed,do your time properly or else on a technicality if youre trying to dodge punishment you should be punished further as a disincentive eg fleeing from a police officer tampering with evidence etc
nottheonion,not_removed,expired toothpaste must be trying to create poison
nottheonion,not_removed,especially considering that so theyre willing to torture someone for an indefinite amount of time for sweeping food on the floor
nottheonion,not_removed,the only message they are sending is commit suicide before they find you this shit is why i have trouble honoring our military theyre punishing someone for suicide they are torturing her
nottheonion,not_removed,the only thing lacking is torture but then again she did try to end her own life so i doubt shes being treated well
nottheonion,not_removed,they would have just killed him as soon as they caught him
nottheonion,not_removed,ever heard of gitmo
nottheonion,not_removed,might
nottheonion,not_removed,the definition of torture including solitary confinement is a hotly debated topic and although there are supporters there are also critics its not as black and white as solitary torture the definition of torture has been expanding over the last years as society becomes more vigilant of abuse for example caning is now considered torture where in the it was a reasonable punishment solitary looks set to be the newest addition to expanded definition of torture but it hasnt been recognised by many legal authorities yet only watchdogs like the un
nottheonion,not_removed,military prison is not meant to help you adjust to your new psuedo gender its not meant to be nice little fucker shouldnt have been such an attention seeker could have just finished a simple enlistment and gone about their life
nottheonion,not_removed,or get the fuck out of the country
nottheonion,not_removed,torture did you miss indefinite solitary confinement that is torture
nottheonion,not_removed,so edgy you totally get what its like to live in a dictatorship
nottheonion,not_removed,much better fate than being kept in a cage for life which is worse than what we do to dogs and cats personally i think id probably kill myself rather than go to jail even in the us for an extended period of time just couldnt cope with the insanity of it in there
nottheonion,not_removed,killing him would have turned him into a martyr you cant have that side note when referring to manning in past tense should they be referred to as he or she
nottheonion,not_removed,cognitive dissonance army sounds about right i dont even know what dissonance means
nottheonion,not_removed,the article itself is sourced the torture thing seems to be from here youd know if you bothered to read it rather than just looking for some low hanging fruit to moan about
nottheonion,not_removed,while youre not wrong the problem with pointing out your source isnt perfect is that it immediately derails and probably destroys the discussion
nottheonion,not_removed,mmmmm boots are so tasty though
nottheonion,not_removed,which she is threatened with i am assuming she tried to kill herself because she was already tortured
nottheonion,not_removed,just conspicuously never use pronouns
nottheonion,not_removed,the article referred to an all male prison and then referred to her as a she all in one paragraph well fucking done
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont give a fuck im tired of being told how to refer to these trans strangoes they sure as fuck arent women so they need to pick a new word maybe make one up and stop appropriating words that already have a meaning also killing him would not have made him a martyr no one would have known about it besides he leaked shit people already knew about now that attention seeking dipshit gets to sit in prison

nottheonion,not_removed,no the renaming does not affect his english name but his chinese name in hong kong they felt the new name pei ka yau is less cantonese than the original bei ka chiu the choice of a more mandarin name vs cantonese is a serious issue especially in hong kong
nottheonion,not_removed,if im not mistaken there are two different spanish translations of the games i cant confirm this right now since bulbapedia appears to be downagain which caused a similar issue since one of the two translations is much newer than the other edit i think im mistaken actually while im personally against renamings i dont know enough about the mandarincantonese conflict to actually apply that opinion to this situation edit here we go the quebec french adaptation of the franchise had a mix of its own french translations and the english translation during its early days with a small amount of material from france which was eventually phased out in favor of almost entirely importing european french material revision linked in case of edits this resulted in a large number of name changes since the old names were technically unofficial i think i found out about this originally on bulbanews but i cant find the article there incidentially it appears that the op article doesnt mention that

nottheonion,not_removed,having worked in the field for years now this is far from the stupidest thing ive talked to someone about i had a lady call to ask if it is legal to sell a baby ive had multiple people call to find out what time it is i talked to a lady who got robbed for her phone by the people she set up a drug deal with and wanted a police report i talked to a guy who was pissed off cause he saw someone get pulled over for speeding past a cop i talked to a guy who wanted a spanishspeaking cop to come out and translate a spam email from mexico cause it said something about how he was going to go to jail according to the internet translator he ran it through he had never been to mexico btw i asked i talked to a guy who wanted cops to come out and fix the cable line running from the pole to his house cause his cable went out during a rain storm just when i think ive heard the stupidest thing ever humanity steps up and proves me wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,so if i call the cops and claim im getting ripped off since im only getting can i get a price increase
nottheonion,not_removed,how many bowls did she smoke first
nottheonion,not_removed,im working at a convenience store in college and one day this woman barges in completely frantic she screams at no one in particular flour that son of a bitch sold me flour i just look at her dumbfounded not saying a word she then looks at me you call the cops that son of a bitch sold me flour i finally caught on to what she really wanted to purchase i had a sheltered childhood and i just crossed my arms and looked at her shes not relenting call the cops now i finally speak maam you want me to call the cops she cuts me off yes now i continue because instead of cocaine you got flour she finally realized where i was going and then walked out of the store completely deflated
nottheonion,not_removed,these prices are a criminal ripoff
nottheonion,not_removed,the police arent doing their jobs right this woman deserves justice
nottheonion,not_removed,im a budtender in colorado and i thought for sure it was one of our customers

nottheonion,not_removed,they said i bought some fire but all i got was a bag of tinder
nottheonion,not_removed,i took a call where a kid was upset that a coworker at a major fast food chain stole his weed i confirmed several times that it was his weed and that he definitely wanted to make a report he did what a moron
nottheonion,not_removed,her neighbour said that she can afford it shes rolling in it
nottheonion,not_removed,last line from the police tweet on the incident is like a dad joke if you know a drug dealer who is ripping you off give us a call wed love to help
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont sell crack im a prostitute
nottheonion,not_removed,it seems to me that she didnt really think this through very clearly and dae remember reading something the other day about a guy who called the police because he was too high was found in foetal position surrounded by doritos is selfreporting becoming the new phenomenon best remember to switch my phone off
nottheonion,not_removed,atleast she didnt get caught
nottheonion,not_removed,yo kiwis i hear theres a demand rmicrogrowery

nottheonion,not_removed,newzhub huh seems like a reputable news site
nottheonion,not_removed,many dispensaries do pull bait and switch moves which in most likely all states is illegal they will have an amazing price on their website then you get there and the price is jacked up and they go oh sorry we havent changed the website yet then if you explain to them by law they have to give you the claimed price they tell you to go fuck yourself this is why because its not technically federally legal so there is no protection against stuff like that what are you gonna do call the cops well yeah or get the law involved somehow calling the bbb would probably be more effective but the im a drug dealer i make the rules and theres nothing you can do about it mentality needs to stop from the dispensaries i say good for her edit sorry its early realized this woman is in australia xd
nottheonion,not_removed,i can just imagine the cops response facial expressions to the whole thing lol on the other hand that had to have been a great laugh after a stressful day
nottheonion,not_removed,this a real crime
nottheonion,not_removed,i remember watching en episode of cops where a woman came busting out of an actual crack house and flagged down the cop on camera she then demanded he go arrest her dealer because he took her money and didnt give her the drugs i thought that this had to be staged it was too stupid and bizarre now im not so sure
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree that shit is criminal weed prices are too damn high
nottheonion,not_removed,to be fair thats a valid complaint
nottheonion,not_removed,as a guy in a legalized state who use to be a grower i would have given her a good deal need weed go to josh great bud great prices
nottheonion,not_removed,should be legal everywhere
nottheonion,not_removed,come on people no one is this stupid this is just a lady who wanted to get her dealer raided maybe they did argue over price but she didnt forget weed is illegal
nottheonion,not_removed,what theyre doing is illegal cops i mean youre not wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,why is marijuana still illegal in new zealand ive really never understood it knowing as many pot heads as i do that it is still illegal also if counties and stereotypically close minded as the united states can decriminalise and legalise it why cant new zealand i mean we have an open mind when it comes to abortion and prostitution why not drugs as well
nottheonion,not_removed,once marijuana is commonly used now i bet theyre going to make a new law for those who call while being high lol
nottheonion,not_removed,

nottheonion,not_removed,to be honest most of our headlines here could be on rnottheonion
nottheonion,not_removed,too funny i guess when she made that call she was already high and didnt realize that consequences for her actions
nottheonion,not_removed,this lady has a point though the other day i went to the grocery store and i shit you not lemons were two bucks each its fucking ridiculous
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean its pretty obvious what happened here dealer raises the price woman threatens to call cops if price isnt lowered dealer doesnt believe the threat woman calls cops not an altogether intelligent plan but a plan nonetheless
nottheonion,not_removed,bargin mail order is in canada right now she should move here
nottheonion,not_removed,my theory she called in and basically said my weed dealer is an asshole and he raised his prices he lives at wallaby way go arrest him and the news reported it the way they did because it sounds better than woman snitches on weed dealer
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,when i got here there were comments sure would be a shame if someone had to ruin that
nottheonion,not_removed,this reminds me of an episode of cops where a woman called the police because some crack dealer didnt sell her anything but took her money anyway when the police questioned the dealer she explained that shes not a crack dealer but really was a prostitute the cops reaction was hysterical
nottheonion,not_removed,aint nobody got time fo dat
nottheonion,not_removed,price fixing is only legal when its marijuana
nottheonion,not_removed,i need to move to a country where weed is legal i am tired of our medieval thinking in poland if you tell someone you smoke weed its pretty much the same as saying youre a crack addict
nottheonion,not_removed,thats mustve been some good shit lol
nottheonion,not_removed,she did what she should do
nottheonion,not_removed,good call
nottheonion,not_removed,stupid clearly she should have called whatever the competition or fair trading trading authorities are called in nz almost certainly anticompetitive pricing and probably an oligopoly
nottheonion,not_removed,thats how you know it was good weed
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know how the education standard in new zealand has never really come up some of the dumbest people ive ever met come from new zealand like crazy dumb typical kiwi in australian has run up massive debt in new zealand moved to australia because it is easier than paying your debts only to completely ruin there new credit rating in australia while baycorp tracks them down and tells them the cant just move country and escape there debts or child support so now they are completely broke in another country dumb in twice as much debt and have no problem borrowing money from everyone who will lend it to them if you know a kiwi whose phone always rings but they never answer it be very careful lending them anything
nottheonion,not_removed,sadly i dated this woman
nottheonion,not_removed,australia
nottheonion,not_removed,first lady malaria trump at it again
nottheonion,not_removed,smoke weed everyday
nottheonion,not_removed,cops my dealer raised their prices and i need to rat them out
nottheonion,not_removed,i emphasize with this woman the price of cannabis street recreational and medical throughout the world is too damn high the state that i am in fighting for recreational has the highest medical prices in the country some products are over the price of gold by weight its insane its monopolized and its a fucking plant people are being robbed blind
nottheonion,not_removed,the video had a world map which showed spain colored in green legal is that accurate
nottheonion,not_removed,you clearly dont understand the word fittest in the context of darwinism
nottheonion,not_removed,jeez facepalm
nottheonion,not_removed,people really are dumb sometimes
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess the drugdealer had a good reason to raise prices that had to be some good weed to make you feel like you wanted to tell the cops about it lol
nottheonion,not_removed,obviously the price increase didnt stop her from buying it anyway
nottheonion,not_removed,shmhh amateur she should have called snoop dogg
nottheonion,not_removed,we did it guys we found kevins mom
nottheonion,not_removed,was she mad
nottheonion,not_removed,reasonabke its highway robbery at that point
nottheonion,not_removed,i love how the police response was to joke about how you should call and theyll come arrest you rather than being in a position of trying to help people who are having some addiction problems
nottheonion,not_removed,im literally dying😂😂😂😂best thing ive read this week
nottheonion,not_removed,she knows the cops have caller id right even if her number isnt listed or is set to private
nottheonion,not_removed,i cant comprehend people being this stupid but man is it funny nothing can be parodied or truly made a satire nowadays life is just a big parody
nottheonion,not_removed,if this is a case of a dealer raising prices and a cheap buyer i hope we get more of these when dealers have to compete with legitimate dispensaries i think their called and hopefully they just get wiped out then after a year or so of the cool factor dying and we reaped the taxes it just goes as another stupid phase
nottheonion,not_removed,no description or picture of the woman and this being the nw territories leads me to assume it was an aboriginal woman who called the cops or it could have been a really drunk white gal but that just doesnt seem as likely since its mostly just the natives up there
nottheonion,not_removed,rrealproblems here
nottheonion,not_removed,good for her for calling
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe she made a bet that shell be in the news next day evil genius
nottheonion,not_removed,the weed is too damn high
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess it was some good shit
nottheonion,not_removed,really this is so funny and yet i beleive she did it love the cops response
nottheonion,not_removed,hahahaha this is hilarious reminds me of the police blotter from my very small home town
nottheonion,not_removed,it was too high
nottheonion,not_removed,canada is regularly cad like usd a gram
nottheonion,not_removed,solid meme
nottheonion,not_removed,hey using new zealand media is surely cheating on rnottheonion
nottheonion,not_removed,who says criminals have no recourse
nottheonion,not_removed,i live in tn so no not legal but still kinda regulated
nottheonion,not_removed,yall should just be thankful that you live in a state that has a despencerary or medical marijuana in tennessee if you get caught with just one joint its impound your vehicle arrested and taking to jail one year of supervised probation and court costs and fines how do i know bc its exactly what happened to me total money racket id love to smoke and be free but in the gop conservative south most likely not gonna happen anytime soon
nottheonion,not_removed,this might get you charged with something even if it was something legal
nottheonion,not_removed,hits blunt higher prices higher high right
nottheonion,not_removed,remember kidsdont do drugs
nottheonion,not_removed,when she tells the cops whats wrong they respond with we get it you smoke
nottheonion,not_removed,stupid bitch
nottheonion,not_removed,pot dealer fuck off copers
nottheonion,not_removed,just how many pots had she smoken
nottheonion,not_removed,how much high was she while making a call thats the only reason to do anything this high
nottheonion,not_removed,how much high was she while making a call thats the only reason to do anything this high
nottheonion,not_removed,well shes a woman
nottheonion,not_removed,seems like a complete bullshit article that was written to cash in on a popular topic maybe its due to complete vagueness maybe its due to how the article ends maybe its because of how the quotes are unaccredited and the article is complete dog shit iamhonka
nottheonion,not_removed,marijuana should be too pricey for anybody to afford its a scourge on our country and contributing to the moral degeneracy of our culture
nottheonion,not_removed,rise in marijuana price rtitlegore
nottheonion,not_removed,part of the selfentitlement class of americans
nottheonion,not_removed,i always thought grownups automatically knew what to do in any given situation i dont think idve been in such a hurry to reach adulthood if i knew the whole thing was going to be adlibbed calvins dad
nottheonion,not_removed,all of them
nottheonion,not_removed,i just thought that one of the shops around here was ripping her off i didnt realize it was humorous in fact the whole legalization scheme in washington sucks because it was basically designed to undermine the medical dispensaries that actually help people for decent prices
nottheonion,not_removed,you have met my wife
nottheonion,not_removed,its northern australia many of the folks i know from there get their weed from the police officers the best stuff but also the most expensive one told me maybe she thought she was speaking to the dealer instead of his colleague
nottheonion,not_removed,the phrase donny youre out of your element has become applicable on way too many levels lately
nottheonion,not_removed,i do and all of my friends are when i find someone who knows what is going on i will let you know
nottheonion,not_removed,i think that last few months have made it evident that there are loads of incredibly idiotic people
nottheonion,not_removed,no shit a good drug dealer knows you dont raise the price on a long term customer like that
nottheonion,not_removed,there are people out there who think that men poop in urinals
nottheonion,not_removed,most people really
nottheonion,not_removed,i know im one of them
nottheonion,not_removed,a news article is just a description of a funny image
nottheonion,not_removed,whats the crime stoppers thing you get batman on the line instead of normal cops
nottheonion,not_removed,this is a stupid tactic for cops to use ive seen a few other things where cops post local drugs contaminated come by a station to have them tested and of course they just arrest anyone who shows up it breaks down trust even more for people who already wary of police
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,whats up with that number which one is correct all is that one number
nottheonion,not_removed,but if the weed blunts itself isnt that cannabism
nottheonion,not_removed,you cannabiserious
nottheonion,not_removed,key and peele have done this
nottheonion,not_removed,you need to cut it
nottheonion,not_removed,my theory she called in and basically said my weed dealer is an asshole and he raised his prices he lives at wallaby way go arrest him and the news reported it the way they did because it sounds better than woman snitches on weed dealer
nottheonion,not_removed,story is from darwin northern territory my home town the place is full of some of the dumbest fuckers walking the earth
nottheonion,not_removed,she was probably high bruh
nottheonion,not_removed,im assuming they dont
nottheonion,not_removed,she was high on some good shit when youre on that good good even a stupid ass idea can make sense
nottheonion,not_removed,it really is amazing isnt it i put it down to the fact that most uneducated people will respond to emotion over logic very quickly and do stupid shit like this only of the population would be this stupid but they make headlines because of it and it starts to make people ask the exact question you just asked lol
nottheonion,not_removed,a lot of them arent and end up in jail
nottheonion,not_removed,stupidity comes in many shapes most people are intelligent in some way and stupid in another
nottheonion,not_removed,serious answer watching some people i know who are clueless in many ways go through life and such i think life in our society is easier than we think there is no other explanation
nottheonion,not_removed,i talked to a guy who wanted cops to come out and fix the cable line running from the pole to his house cause his cable went out during a rain storm cant get to reddit call the amberlamps
nottheonion,not_removed,where does one find a bow for
nottheonion,not_removed,are u only dropping do you use a broker is your trim job just good enough these are the usual reasons
nottheonion,not_removed,its australia mate we smoke cones not bowls and she seemed pretty fucking pissed so i guess not many
nottheonion,not_removed,thats right up there with the crackhead who tried to rat himself out to the anonymous tip line for the reward money
nottheonion,not_removed,well the more the police does its job the lower supply lower supply at the same demand means higher prices
nottheonion,not_removed,people are stupid but i think cops is a trivial name for an important job police sounds much more official imo im calling the cops smacks of a child saying im telling my dad saying im calling the police sounds a lot more threatening in most cases i can think of replacing the word cops with police gives everything more gravitas although im sure some smart are reply will prove me wrong i think this carries over into some peoples mentality
nottheonion,not_removed,that is the best profession title i have ever heard
nottheonion,not_removed,ok but seriously some places do charge some whack prices especially the open late ones in aurora
nottheonion,not_removed,an where i live oz beautiful british columbia
nottheonion,not_removed,we couldve had it aaaaaaaaaall rolling in the daaaaaaank
nottheonion,not_removed,even if its traceable back to her they have nothing to charge her with maybe wasting police time
nottheonion,not_removed,sadly people really are this stupid its astonishing
nottheonion,not_removed,im as proweed as the next guy hell im a major stoner myself but this is a crap argument something being naturally occuring does not make it not dangerous weed is fairly harmless but if it was more dangerous it being a flower doesnt make it ok to grow and sell
nottheonion,not_removed,tobacco is just a shrub are poppies are just flowers plenty of things are natural and bad for you hell jimson weed is a powerful dissociative that can really fuck up your mental health and it grows in every drainage ditch in the american south weed is tight but there are better arguments than it being natural
nottheonion,not_removed,tobacco is a just plant bro it cant be bad for you
nottheonion,not_removed,think youve had to many marjuana today
nottheonion,not_removed,from the uk coming to aus soon what type of prices per gram am i looking at also any tips on finding some in melbourne
nottheonion,not_removed,weed prices went up proportionally until early then it went crazy
nottheonion,not_removed,youre completely correct drug dealers are getting away with charging for a gram we need to get our heads out of our asses legalize this shit and profit this isnt rocket science edit i dont even know if you are talking about street dealers but i am
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know about the us but a lot of places have price controls on some products id imagine police wouldnt think their time is being wasted rather someone misunderstood how to deal with their complaint though maybe not the emergency number
nottheonion,not_removed,can u not
nottheonion,not_removed,thats racist
nottheonion,not_removed,only for the bottom of the food chain little fish
nottheonion,not_removed,this was in australia weed still isnt legal there this means she tried to complain about the price of an illegal substance and thought the cops would be able to fix it
nottheonion,not_removed,ill say that is stupid a lot of things are but chill my dude
nottheonion,not_removed,you sound like a riot
nottheonion,not_removed,all marijuana dispensaries agreeing to hike the price up together this is what is happening today with those in power
nottheonion,not_removed,idve is that how you spell it and is it considered a real word idve lol
nottheonion,not_removed,idve he cant do that can he do that
nottheonion,not_removed,where do i sign up to be one of them
nottheonion,not_removed,my thought exactly
nottheonion,not_removed,a few times
nottheonion,not_removed,the past participle would be meated
nottheonion,not_removed,just last night
nottheonion,not_removed,its actually northern territory australia northern australia spans statesterritories i am from there and ill tell you now fuck all people get their weed from cops it is expensive tho an oz
nottheonion,not_removed,the aborigine is not the issue indigenousaustralian please
nottheonion,not_removed,thats why i used the past tense
nottheonion,not_removed,that image isnt really funny though
nottheonion,not_removed,we have crime stoppers in the us too its an anonymous tip line that pays cash rewards in some circumstances
nottheonion,not_removed,nar its just paul hogan with a knife
nottheonion,not_removed,if its like the one weve got here in nz its an anonymous tipline for reporting crimes where you dont want to be known as the person who tipped the cops off
nottheonion,not_removed,we get told to call crime stoppers if we see anything suspicious in aus i have never questioned it until now i hope we have batman backing up the force
nottheonion,not_removed,there was one particular case where a texas pd posted on their facebook page that meth and heroin in the area had been laced with ebola and to bring it to the police station to be tested pro they caught a couple gullible druggies con they told the people of their town that they had fucking ebola
nottheonion,not_removed,in the netherlands you can actually go get your drugs tested and you get them back no police
nottheonion,not_removed,its clearly a joke though i cant speak for other countries but practically everything the australian police facebook pages post have some sort of joke worked in if theres been a stupid crime thing happening its not really the same as deceitful fake drug testing stings honestly anyone stupid enough to complain about dealer prices to a cop shop is asking for it as for drug testing theres been a recent push for it to really be widely available so its not really on the same level as this
nottheonion,not_removed,except that this is a joke not a trap
nottheonion,not_removed,i think considering how ludicrous it was that this woman would call the police to report her situation makes the tactic more of a joke the cop post you wrote is outright deception nothing the same
nottheonion,not_removed,like others have said its pretty common in aus for cops to post funny stuff on social media not like some of the examples posted about us police i follow the police here in western australia on twitter and it is part have you seen the person part stupid criminal stories and part funny random thingsphotos cops come across while out and about
nottheonion,not_removed,this just naturally selection and best to have those people off the street before they try making toast in the public pool
nottheonion,not_removed,i think they as well want to believe no one else is this dumb or somber you would probably go insane in their place if you had to deal with the amount of stupid and crazy they do on a regular basis and not be able to make light of it and the only thing cops hate more than criminals is being used by snitches it could also be a tongue in cheek warning i guess theyre not here to get back at dealers that piss you off when you dont get your way
nottheonion,not_removed,if people are that stupid perhaps they shouldnt be selfmedicating either
nottheonion,not_removed,i believe the first is the number for a nonemergency police line if thats what youre asking australias emergency number is
nottheonion,not_removed,we need to have a joint effort in order to decrease the price of pot
nottheonion,not_removed,its cannabisism
nottheonion,not_removed,is this key peels or madtv genuinely curious
nottheonion,not_removed,dose background guns though
nottheonion,not_removed,holy fuck thank you this is great
nottheonion,not_removed,why the heck do english people use present perfect instead of simple past tense
nottheonion,not_removed,content and realism entertainment
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,and bingo was his nameo
nottheonion,not_removed,is that the nemo adress
nottheonion,not_removed,his name must be nemo
nottheonion,not_removed,thread
nottheonion,not_removed,but she hung up when they asked for details she basically just said the price was too high and hung up when they tried to find out anything
nottheonion,not_removed,or she was just a teenager trying make a prank
nottheonion,not_removed,also from darwin and im conflicted not sure if proud that were on the front page or depressed that its for this story as an aside weed is fucking pricy up here id be mad as well
nottheonion,not_removed,apes p also to quote george carlinthink of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that
nottheonion,not_removed,i too have worked retail
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,he said assuming at least a pound draw you should be looking around thatd better be a damn good bow
nottheonion,not_removed,im asking the same question
nottheonion,not_removed,probably at the really shit weed store
nottheonion,not_removed,totally do you even use scales when you sell to local dropins
nottheonion,not_removed,shes clearly been drinking because she cant afford the pot anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,still probably my all time favorite
nottheonion,not_removed,assuming dune reference if so nice im rereading that now
nottheonion,not_removed,paying for convenience just like vs the grocery store
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds delicious theres no near legalization in the midwest 😓
nottheonion,not_removed,sort of correct im an assistant manager at a dispensary in oregon and when the oregon liquor control commission took over the lab testing prices went from for day return tests to a batch and you wont see test results for days because theres only about state approved testing facilities right now for dispensaries in the state processors literally threw away thousands of dollars getting things retested in the beginning because we now have the highest pesticide standards in the united states and nothing was passing the new tests unfortunately retailers had to absorb a lot of that cost and its been passed down to consumers because otherwise the businesses wouldnt survive cannabis shops that operate legally immediately give away upwards of of total income to taxes employee payroll labels childproof jars labels bags child safety warnings etc all of these are required by law but not tax deductible since cannabis is still a schedule drug were definitely seeing a lot of people return to the black market which is a scary situation for a lot of reasons anyway i could probably go on but i think a lot of people assume that those who own dispensaries are just raking it in being legal drug lords when in reality its a lot of daily stress and a lot of legalities to keep up with that change literally every day and the margin for profit is really a lot less than most people think
nottheonion,not_removed,break up big mary
nottheonion,not_removed,not mine i grow my own so i know whats onin it same price medical grade for a rereational fun time awww yeah
nottheonion,not_removed,what does that have to do with calvins dad did you reply to the wrong comment
nottheonion,not_removed,regardless of this being true or not this sounds illegal not a lawyer but this is some kind of price fixing
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks obama waiti mean thanks trump
nottheonion,not_removed,this is what has happened everyday ever concerning every single crop to those who dont grow their own
nottheonion,not_removed,im not entirely sure its a contraction of id have and id is a contraction of i would so contracting i would have down to a single word could wind up with two apostrophes but i havent seen a word with two apostrophes outside of fantasy before ive never seen this word written but ive heard it in speech plenty
nottheonion,not_removed,yallvent seen nothin yet
nottheonion,not_removed,creating a reddit profile is a good start
nottheonion,not_removed,you gotta stop pimping your wife joe
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,what the actual fuck an ounce max its people like you that stop it dropping further
nottheonion,not_removed,i know mate i was expressing my agreement with you my sad sad terribly disappointed agreement
nottheonion,not_removed,funny enough to belong in rfunny
nottheonion,not_removed,are weed prices criminal give us a call
nottheonion,not_removed,well either that or they pay you a visit
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess telling people they have ebola is just another acceptable cost of the drug war
nottheonion,not_removed,and worse if some domestic terrorist group or lunatic thinking he heard the voice of god does decides to lace heroin with ebola or something massively dangerous and contagious nobody is going to believe them when they still have the chance to contain the situation
nottheonion,not_removed,the way it should be
nottheonion,not_removed,yup nt where this took place and act have pretty laxed cannabis laws aswell
nottheonion,not_removed,well it is a trap for the very stupid drug users are often pretty fucking stupid also oftentimes high drunk or otherwise intoxicated
nottheonion,not_removed,how about you just grow your own weed in a pot you can weed out the lazy third party sellers
nottheonion,not_removed,this guy has the right joint of view
nottheonion,not_removed,bluntly said
nottheonion,not_removed,madtv
nottheonion,not_removed,and the people before him not so much
nottheonion,not_removed,this is hilarious is it real
nottheonion,not_removed,cops the tv show is a constant stream of stupidity on display and real life examples of what not to do
nottheonion,not_removed,actually i think his name was p sherman
nottheonion,not_removed,wallaby way sydney
nottheonion,not_removed,being the fittest doesnt mean shit when your fat stupid enemies have better weapons just ask the aborigines
nottheonion,not_removed,different bows for different bros my friend
nottheonion,not_removed,beautiful bow bro
nottheonion,not_removed,designed to pierce tanks with only arrows
nottheonion,not_removed,or sniffing glue or kerosene thats how they roll up northern australia
nottheonion,not_removed,just imagine if instead of having a bunch of useless social etiquette about cornering the bowl and not cashing it at the expense of the group you had a single serve cone shaped metal piece so you chop up then you have a cone and pass the bong everyone gets their own cone it makes total sense australians look at americans weed smoking practices and wonder wtf is going on its like in america we can only drink milk from the gallon bottle it is a point of etiquette not to leave residue on the lip or to allow backwash from your swig and australians are like pour it into a glass
nottheonion,not_removed,thats what is most commonly used in aus after pulling it you dont remove the cone piece to let air in like you would with a glass bowl piece instead there is a hole on the front side or back of the bong that you cover with your fingerthumb while you pull the bong then soon as you pull it all you release your fingerthumb to let the air in
nottheonion,not_removed,it isnt legal here either in canada but the dispensaries stay in business and theres quite a few dispensaries to choose from no medical card needed just need to be or older and have government photo id
nottheonion,not_removed,bare that in mind cheers
nottheonion,not_removed,no but you assumed its sex how dare you
nottheonion,not_removed,can confirm regulations in ca are out of control as well forcing many growers who would love to be legitimate remain black market in order to generate the entry funds necessary to pay the county state epa and so on
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a real shame
nottheonion,not_removed,as an oregon i understand the frustration of dealing with the olcc was not the right entity for it to be under in my opinion as a consumer i have noticed since the beginning of the year is prices in most dispenseries have gone up others have dropped the ones that went up have higher per gram prices with no quantity price reduction as a consumer the quality has dropped as well in the dispenseries since last year the black market seems to have higher quality and tested than shops do now at much lower prices example god bud tested at one shop has it for a gram and another down the street has the same farm at an eighth the prices are all over the place now
nottheonion,not_removed,wait a minute you have to pay tax for the money you make and cant even deduct costs for employees rent and stuff
nottheonion,not_removed,regulation kills small business more than taxes in many instances the states that were liberal enough to legalize marijuana are some of the worst commercial climates to operate small business in you outlined the catch very well i do for what its worth imagine this changes for the better in the coming years as trump is progrowthjobs and antiregulation but much is ultimately dependent on your state
nottheonion,not_removed,im not sure why they should still pay taxes if even the bank wont take their money because its illegal on a federal level
nottheonion,not_removed,dang you give away of total income towards operational costs of the business what an outrage lol
nottheonion,not_removed,the hamp is so easy to grow and process why even bother with buying it in the shop
nottheonion,not_removed,ahm thats too bad administration always making things better for the contributor
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt that a starting hitch just some teething problems all this is fairly new and i suppose it wont be ongoing on the upsidefrom a consumers point of view you get quality standards formerly unheard of weed of known quality and without pesticides imho are well worth the teething problems and i absolutely envy you for that legal recreational use will come back in my lifetime and with some luck i can get the nice and friendly weed of my childhood and not that superpotent sendmetosleep smackinthehead that seems to circulate at the moment this is still half a blunt not a blunt thats already half gone
nottheonion,not_removed,if your expenses are of income thats actually a really good profit margin
nottheonion,not_removed,at least now we have a clear example to use against conservatives that think that people on the left are proregulations when they are asinine we are not
nottheonion,not_removed,some of that is cogs and is deductible
nottheonion,not_removed,no he didnt
nottheonion,not_removed,and if youre asking that question youre already one of them
nottheonion,not_removed,but his name is anyways joe has his wife working the corners now i heard so hes in too deep to turn back now
nottheonion,not_removed,hey joe where are you going with that gun in your hand
nottheonion,not_removed,are you australian if you are you should be aware how remote and sparsely populated the northern territory is people dont really have much choice in who to buy off hell i live in nsw and while i personally know hook ups for an o the regular price is
nottheonion,not_removed,you aint got the answers sway
nottheonion,not_removed,always has been always will be
nottheonion,not_removed,its an ounce you quit wrecking my margins
nottheonion,not_removed,they leave cash with a bank teller and you can pick it up with a code they give you over the phone i think its something like that read about it ages ago
nottheonion,not_removed,leave the money under the binliner of a parks trash can have you never watched crime tv shows
nottheonion,not_removed,crocodile dundee is paul hogan so you were pretty close
nottheonion,not_removed,not sure if this is a satirical comment or not protip paul hogan is the actor who played mick dundee
nottheonion,not_removed,wait the wrestler
nottheonion,not_removed,sure if the lab is privately funded and paying for their own testing also not rolling the cost into the costs of other testing such as contract work from law enforcement my tax dollars should not be used to make sure youre getting clean meth as long as thats the case test as much meth as you want idgaf
nottheonion,not_removed,youre taking care of two birds with one stoned
nottheonion,not_removed,im ganja nip these puns in the bud before they get out of hand
nottheonion,not_removed,idk if you were serious or not but growing weed takes months to grow and a lot of taking care of
nottheonion,not_removed,nip those price increases in the bud
nottheonion,not_removed,in i started legally growing in michigan my friend was experienced a bit and knew what he was doing ill keep this short but it took thousands of dollars in equipment a lot of time and know how just to grow plants with pretty decent quality it wasnt worth it
nottheonion,not_removed,thought so thx
nottheonion,not_removed,im guessing you dont get lips that look like the woman from just being short on chapstick
nottheonion,not_removed,you clearly dont understand the word fittest in the context of darwinism
nottheonion,not_removed,lb draw pierce tanks i dont think that is how it works
nottheonion,not_removed,petrol mate ice if earn good coin
nottheonion,not_removed,you dont have to travel north to see that happens in bankstown for fucks sake
nottheonion,not_removed,besides getting caught why is the black market such a bad thing
nottheonion,not_removed,if youre a small businessman i think accounting for how much regulations cost in terms of time is also important
nottheonion,not_removed,i think this is a fantastic thing to put on a graphic as many people relate better to visuals than data the abc stores in virginia have a poster near the cash registers that show a bottle of generic booze with markings at several levels that show how much goes to state taxes federal taxes percentage to alcohol education etc and finally what goes to the distillerdistributor its a small fraction while i may get pissed at the total amount of tax im paying i hold no grudge to the money that is going to the actual creators
nottheonion,not_removed,so shop around for the best price
nottheonion,not_removed,as a consumer the quality has dropped as well in the dispenseries since last year depends what youre looking for ive seen a huge improvement in the oil really impressive stuff im all for regulations if it means i get cleaner product obviously the regulations are pretty crazy right now but damn making solventless the only way to go is such a great move
nottheonion,not_removed,you cant if its for a controlled substance thanks to congress and one of the parts of the controlled substances act from what i remember
nottheonion,not_removed,and you have to deal in cash only they had to build a fortified room at the oregon department of revenue for dispensaries to come drop off truck loads of cash every quarter its a really strange market
nottheonion,not_removed,you can deduct cash purchases in small business lets see for little things like a trip to the hardware store i save receipts for bigger things like rent you could always just buy a bunch of money orders or something
nottheonion,not_removed,regulations are the trade off for living in a safe society especially in a complex world like ours i know they may sound absurd but most of them are necessary child safety chemicals and environmental controls quality testing ingredient listings etc theyre all regulations and they are indispensable for our own safety
nottheonion,not_removed,regulations need purpose beyond providing income to the state a bad regulation does not negate the need for regulation in general
nottheonion,not_removed,we dont live in anarchy without regulations its just buying stuff from random dudes the regulations are correct dont always search for the easy way out that would make things bad as before regulations help not getting rid of regulations
nottheonion,not_removed,rimalibertarianandthisisdeep
nottheonion,not_removed,he is also antipot so its going to be interesting to see what he does
nottheonion,not_removed,because income received from criminal activity is explicitly still taxable and they dont want the irs to come down on their asses
nottheonion,not_removed,so is bread but people still buy that
nottheonion,not_removed,good hemp isnt
nottheonion,not_removed,you dont want to grow hemp for starters and its not at all easy to grow if you want some good bud
nottheonion,not_removed,well its legal in my state but not in my city so youre forced to buy it there one reason
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah youre right it does seem a little too coincidental that the completely unrelated comment he replied to just happened to be right near the top of the page and was getting attention
nottheonion,not_removed,one of us one of us one of us
nottheonion,not_removed,just saw your username never thought goku would ever fight a race war
nottheonion,not_removed,im going down to shoot my old lady you know i caught her messin round messin round with another man
nottheonion,not_removed,im australian i suppose for context nimbin is an hour drive away a gram is pretty standard
nottheonion,not_removed,sure tassie bags are normally for bush and for hydro
nottheonion,not_removed,thank you been wondering since i was way simpler than i imagined
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know who mick dundee is so i just imagined crocodile dundee and laughed anyway
nottheonion,not_removed,mick dundee was based on paul hogan
nottheonion,not_removed,until the swat team kicks in the door
nottheonion,not_removed,that was kind of painful but credit given rep
nottheonion,not_removed,get two birds stoned at once ricky
nottheonion,not_removed,i can thc that
nottheonion,not_removed,neither are they dont feel bad
nottheonion,not_removed,if you lighten up theyll come
nottheonion,not_removed,hey dont worry all you really need to learn to do is leave behind a smoking crater from the mass face palms and a few bursted eardrums from the groans
nottheonion,not_removed,even after all that its a grind
nottheonion,not_removed,not enough people do
nottheonion,not_removed,its worth dollars its got space technology to amplify the exerted force
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe its metric pounds
nottheonion,not_removed,how is this scenario any different what if only one guy has weed is he supposed to share his bowl with everyone there is no force if weed is being shared from one guy then hell chop up whatever he wants to contribute and thats the weed the group can smoke individually instead of some bickerprone communal trough where everyone has to be careful how they smoke fuck that hey mate you want a cone yeah man thatd be great cone given cheers mate done and dusted
nottheonion,not_removed,its a shotty brah
nottheonion,not_removed,i would imagine higher rates of crime and higher prices for the consumer since the dealer has to incur more risk
nottheonion,not_removed,lack of regulations normally im against regulations but in the case of marijuana your black market dealer doesnt have to care if his stuff has been coated in pesticides or other chemicals and he can and will charge you the same price for crap quality and charge more for really good stuff which half the time you wont know what youve bought until you get home and smoke it and who wants to face off against a dealer that their smoke sucked and you want a refund its been pointed out that i may be wrong on the prices in legalized states til plus it under cuts on the legitimate sellers which doesnt help the argument that legalizing marijuana helps bring in more in taxes for the state if nobody is buying from dispensaries there isnt any tax revenue coming in
nottheonion,not_removed,remember back when the big statement that was made about marijuana was that it was a gateway drug while that wasnt true it also wasnt entirely false marijuana itself wont make you smoke meth or snort cocaine but by being exposed to people who sell drugs illegally you have a much higher risk of being exposed to a higher grade of narcotic now while this doesnt force people to try harder drugs it does create a gateway into the world of recreational life destroying drugs
nottheonion,not_removed,the black market is unregulated which inherits risk whatever youre buying could be laced or cut with something else
nottheonion,not_removed,mostly it funds organised crime
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree but to a certain extent there is such thing as overregulation for example why shoud pot have tighter testing standards than any other foodstuffs testing for pesticides is important just that if hypothetically the regulation warrants that it be below the safe level when below the safe level is adequate you get flagged with many false positives you have an item that is safe to consume but fails regulation anyways that should never be the intent of regulation
nottheonion,not_removed,child safety is the perfect example no we do not need that weve never had child safety for marijuana or alcohol and things have been pretty okay hurts the business more than it helps little johnny whos parents are capable of making the weed inaccessible themselves
nottheonion,not_removed,some regulations the amount of regulation were seein in the pot industry is ridiculous and aimet at making it harder for them to operate its basically a shakedown because they know ppl have a ridiculously high demand so any supply all gonna sell anyway dont kid urself pesticide standards for testing is not to keep anything safe its to make it harder for shops to operate and ffs how is making them operate in cash only denying banking to any pot business therefore forcing them to hire ex mercs as pmcs private military contractors aka blackwater is not meant to help anybody but the dudes in washington when they say stupid shit like we make these companies stand up to the strictest standards dont kid yaself
nottheonion,not_removed,some regulations are necessary but other times just being an informed consumer would do away with the need for them its not black and white but id say that a good of regulations are not aimed at helping consumers and are instead there to keep competition low since big businesses are hurt less by regulation
nottheonion,not_removed,i totally agree that law regulation and enforcement are the civil difference between order and chaos the thing is its a very shortsighted approach to follow up that assertion by concluding that all laws and all regulations are correct sure thatd be great but its just not the case there are a lot of agendas at play and often they conflict one another or help the wrong people all things in moderation
nottheonion,not_removed,not all regulations are good getting rid of ruinous regulations is not anarchy
nottheonion,not_removed,anarchy is lack of rulers not rules in anarchy you can have competing regulations and the one that produces the best results combination between quality and costs will do better in the market
nottheonion,not_removed,we dont stop by rkratom
nottheonion,not_removed,bread is not easy well growing it is not too bad cat grass is either wheat or oat the real issue is getting good yields uneconomical and then grinding it it if i give you a lb of wheat berries and tell you to make bread well first youll need a good mill handcranked mill will be and its slow
nottheonion,not_removed,sure but still way better then buying it on the street
nottheonion,not_removed,legal to buy but not to grow
nottheonion,not_removed,actually black goku is a character from dragon ball super lol check it out if you want to see one of the best villians of the db series ever imo
nottheonion,not_removed,hey joe i heard you shot your lady down you shot her down in the ground yeah yeah
nottheonion,not_removed,it really depends on who you know and where you live though idk anyone who does a gram though a stick has been pretty universal regardless on what the discounts are for larger quantities
nottheonion,not_removed,if youre an hour away from nimbin no shit you get your weed for a good price i live in melbourne and i usually get ounces for ounces in nt doesnt surprise me at all i used to live hours away out in rural victoria and the price was easily sometimes usually made a trip to the next town over to get weed there for then drive all the way back
nottheonion,not_removed,now you regret not turning that serial killer in
nottheonion,not_removed,same guess i was too afraid to ask
nottheonion,not_removed,as if that would happen with one small plant
nottheonion,not_removed,youre blazing a new trail
nottheonion,not_removed,i know i woke up the next day and realised i really whiffed that one
nottheonion,not_removed,thats one was a stretch but still good
nottheonion,not_removed,shotties mean something pretty different in the sw of the uk where they were invented
nottheonion,not_removed,everyone i meet from legal states say they get dank stuff for just i dont think black market dealers charge more but i may be misinformed
nottheonion,not_removed,honestly that part about the price is wrong most black market dealers in rec states sell much cheaper than dispensary prices and they dont have to comply with thc caps
nottheonion,not_removed,if your dealer doesnt sell good shit you stop buying from him and you start buying from the guy with good reputation
nottheonion,not_removed,its funny how weed you buy is often shit but weed you get as a gift is mostly good quality
nottheonion,not_removed,alcohol is a gateway drug
nottheonion,not_removed,i was interested in psychedelics ever since i took the dare program and heard about how awesome they are would have probably tried them even if i hadnt smoked weed first thats right folks antidrug programs are the gateway
nottheonion,not_removed,cut with coke or what for the same price dealers are not out to kill or poison their customers thats where their income comes from
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean foodstuffs yeah you should test pot more than those but you should probably test tobacco and ecig juice more too and if you proposed a generic inhalant testing law the tobacco lobby would flatten it first thing the next morning the reason you need stricter standards for something you inhale is pure biology when you ingest something your body passes it through filtering stages during which it could be vomited then slowly introduces it to a blood stream which goes straight to the liver which has a second shot at processing it before it goes into the main blood supply when you inhale something it goes straight into the blood stream with only a coarse particle filter provided by your lungs
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree with you there is such a thing as too many regulations i just dislike this mantra that all regulations are bad that i often hear on internet from americans mostly reality is a bit more complex
nottheonion,not_removed,its not banking regulations that is theres no specific rules afaik detailing how pot merchants are supposed to bank afaik the problem is that the banks refuse to do business with pot merchants because they are nervous about breaking federal rules which exist because you know things like colombian drug dealers laundering their money in nice clean branches
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree that regulations have become way too burdensome but dispensaries not being able to use banks is not due to regulations its because marijuana is a schedule drug so banks wont go near it as it is illegal once the schedule is removed banks will work with dispensaries
nottheonion,not_removed,the banking regulations are just ridiculous an acquaintance of mine is an executive at a bank here on the west coast he said he already has a team devoted to working on preparation for when the dispensaries are finally able to deposit their money instead of just accepting cash its taking a while but the restrictions on banking wont last forever
nottheonion,not_removed,nah they just cant be arsed to use better products than shitty pesticides regulation about it is a good thing to trigger change in the right direction the same goes for wine most producers wine makers could go organic and use natural products which are as effective and not detrimental to consumers health its actually cheaper overall but requires more work since the easy route is favored by most then theyre not doing source experienced mba someone whose born in the middle of the winemaking industry
nottheonion,not_removed,could say the same thing about the epa i work in just the emissions of mobile sources side and holy crap is it brutal i think the regs on the books are good for us right now but they are constantly churning new pieces out that are boxing any engine manufacturer of any size into a much much smaller box soon smaller volume engines will be triple in price just because of the required technology and test procedures
nottheonion,not_removed,thats what i meant and i thought that it was obvious that i didnt mean that everything about them is positive or each and every law is correct no of course not but having regulations is correct
nottheonion,not_removed,you can buy flower at the store and cut a few steps thats not my point though
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah it breaks down like this ok its legal to buy it its legal to own it and if youre the proprietor of a hash bar its legal to sell it its legal to carry it butbut that dosent matter cause get a load of this all right if you get stopped by a cop in amsterdam its illegal for them to search you i mean thats a right the cops in amsterdam dont have
nottheonion,not_removed,yes
nottheonion,not_removed,lol ive seen it seeing it glad krillin finally shaved his head again
nottheonion,not_removed,wait ted was a serial killer i thought he just had overdue library books
nottheonion,not_removed,what if it was a medium sized plant
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah it was a little disjointed but roll with it
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah cool you have an entire social system set up to deal with a failing in your hardware australians just share weed or not and if they do heres your weed want another if we want to smoke socially well roll a joint puff puff pass but yeah your system of having too big a conepiece of putting heaps of weed into a single big piece of social etiquette and other useless nonsense thats way better want a cone mate you can smoke the whole thing and noone will be pissed at you oh you wanna share a big cone with someone else for some reason well you can put your own weed into that pointless social morass
nottheonion,not_removed,dunno dude i always hated our system theres always the bogarter or the guy who takes a puff and talks for minutes i eventually settled on only one hitters then you get the idiot trying to smoke of that and pass it even though you told them it was for their head sign me up for the australian way
nottheonion,not_removed,yup
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah nah i invented them aye
nottheonion,not_removed,i know that when i was in the midwest prices were approximately double what they are on the west coast but i wouldnt be surprised if that doesnt hold true for everywhere
nottheonion,not_removed,east coast checking in it is twice that in va bud is as good as anything out west of you have the right connect but its still pretty ridiculous justifying a price hike
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah co checking in black market is still the way to go the most i pay for ozs is and the other day i picked up for the reason is my guy has a dispensary connect so he sends part to him and waits for the money and the other half he sells discounted and can raise in a week he stays in the money his old customers stay happy and paid and he picks up a good payday through the dispensary just over a longer period he told me the dispensary has eliminated him sitting in weight for long periods
nottheonion,not_removed,thats like half the price of it black market in an illegal state cough edit for the good stuff edit any time my friend hears how cheap it is he wants to move
nottheonion,not_removed,you can get a half for where i live
nottheonion,not_removed,they dont dispensaries are charging more youll always get a better deal from your guy than the shop
nottheonion,not_removed,the most ive paid for an eighth in denver dispensaries is around with tax
nottheonion,not_removed,its still illegal where i am so i will admit that i may be wrong how do we do a strike through on reddit ill cross it out so its still visible but others will know i may be wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,true but there isnt always a guy with a better reputation around seen too many people keep buying from the bad guy because they cant find anybody better
nottheonion,not_removed,good shit no pesticides i actually like the testings they do i can buy from growers but i also know the environment some of their shit is grown in i def respect the testing and frequently use it to justify paying dispensary prices
nottheonion,not_removed,lol true but im sure part of that is gratefulness at not having paid for it
nottheonion,not_removed,no this is false in the same way that its false for marijuana
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont agree that anti drug programs are ineffective but dare made me interested in recreational drugs far more then any other avenue my
nottheonion,not_removed,no one says that but idiot right wing nut jobs and the media that wants everyone to think that all conservatives think this way
nottheonion,not_removed,youre correct there is no rule prohibiting it banks run the risk of running up against of bsa and other money laundering regulations if they dont do sufficient due dilligence on their customers right now nobody knows how much work they need to do and how regulators will react so theyre just butting out till something changes
nottheonion,not_removed,clean branches have u ever noticed how miami has more banks than ny u aint gon tell me that miami has a bigger economy than ny
nottheonion,not_removed,agreed legalizing is supposed to save lives by making things safer if large dispensaries are known to be carrying huge sums of money its just a matter of time before people start robbing them
nottheonion,not_removed,yup since he shaved hes been pretty cool again im just waiting on the universal tournament arc with the female broly in it ive kinda dropped the series since my boy black goku died he shouldnt have fused with zamasu he was better off on his own 😭
nottheonion,not_removed,we can hash it out later
nottheonion,not_removed,if anyones wondering whether to expand the we can hash it out later thread above do it
nottheonion,not_removed,see thats the problem all these damn fluctuating prices i wish legal states could all come together and decide on a general price for weed but i know thats a pipe dream
nottheonion,not_removed,co native here before medical pot was legalized our prices were comparable to the rest of the country oz or more eighths if you were really good buddies with the dealer after mmj medical prices slowly started to creep down to about eighths and soon by the time recreational came along medical prices were hitting their bottom and recreational prices were the same cost as it was before medical was legalized for all intents and purposes rec adopted the old black market prices the new black market had to stay competitive with medical marijuana when it was first legalized and then continue to drop in price as supply and demand danced around the black market has always been the lowest price you can regularly find an ounce for or less on the black market and an eighth is not sure where you were getting your prices from but you can verify my claims by looking up a local co dispensary and inspect their menu and you can look up mmj delivery in craigslist and you will see the prices it costs to have mmj delivered to your door despite all the extremely unsavory political juju happening in the us live is ok here in co where the weed is cheap potent and ever abundant i suppose the biggest problem we face now is apathy
nottheonion,not_removed,out here in fl its for a quarter of the good stuff on the street how does that compare
nottheonion,not_removed,midwest resident here dro went from a gram to to in the last year and a half or so colorado has driven the black market costs down around here
nottheonion,not_removed,damn thats a shame hopefully its just like when washington state went up in their prices a year or ago meaning eventually it will come back down soon but for now thats outrageous to charge that
nottheonion,not_removed,but its still pretty ridiculous justifying a price hike this is what economists would call an easy opportunity for arbitrage anyone with a car can buy cannabis in a legal state and sell it in a prohibition state there is virtually no barrier to entry into the market but there is a significant legal risk therefor a price premium
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah i pay an ounce in baltimore and thats a good price compared to most people i know we still live in quarter land most of the time over here
nottheonion,not_removed,you must not be in denver oz of blue dream picked up yesterday granted its a sale but this particular dispensary let their ounces go for any other day and it is above average quality
nottheonion,not_removed,this shit makes me legit angry i recently spent on a half of some shit at best before that i spent on some shit which had to be played up by the guy i bought it from he chose the word crispy it was a and a third stems check it out man this stuff is fire see how uh crispy it is like do i just slowly climb the ladder of dissatisfaction until im talking to a supplier or something what the fuck do i do in texas alternatively could your guy get some smellproof bags and ship fedex
nottheonion,not_removed,if i could get some dank for a g id be bouncing off the walls doing cartwheels and shit its hard out here in illegal states 😔
nottheonion,not_removed,holy shit where is that i need to book a flight there as soon as i get some time off from work those halfs and os are what im trying to score
nottheonion,not_removed,nice i get an eighth for round here good to know its not too big of a difference in price between texas and legal states
nottheonion,not_removed,you put double signs on each side
nottheonion,not_removed,ive met a few people here who say that
nottheonion,not_removed,removing all regulations is one of the major postulates of anarchocapitalists
nottheonion,not_removed,i think the colombians launder in the east coast the russians in london the chinese oligarchs are buying up vancouver seeing as this problem has been going on for decades quick google will show scores of articles from on its a fair guess that the really rich still find a way and its just that these new dispensaries are too small to risk the regulations for
nottheonion,not_removed,i liked zamasu and the whole timering thing but he was doomed from the start whis and beerus would always stand in his way even if goku didnt
nottheonion,not_removed,sing a song of freedom

nottheonion,not_removed,florida floridaing again
nottheonion,not_removed,i can see the yelp reviews now
nottheonion,not_removed,a verbal argument started when one of the teens said they were not satisfied with the amount of lemonade poured in their cups police say this angered one of the victims he threw a cup of lemonade at teens according to deputies a police report states one of the teens pushed a to the ground sounds like the nineyearold learned a valuable lesson that day
nottheonion,not_removed,i read the title like they kidnapped children from the lemonade stand
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like the year old began it by throwing lemonade at the teens technically this is a crime as well death penalty for everyone
nottheonion,not_removed,what the actual fuck the kids were years old i guess thats florida for you maybe thats just another friday for them
nottheonion,not_removed,guys the thermal drill go get it
nottheonion,not_removed,you know its a big heists when they mention the hundredths

nottheonion,not_removed,i know this is not the onion but its actually a serious issue if you just read the title read the article which explains why tldr essentially if you mark anything other than nonreligious youre counted as religious which has a flow on effect to all sorts of things that you probably wont like as a nonreligious person
nottheonion,not_removed,what lawpolicyetc would it affect is there one that affects all religious people no matter which one or do they count them all as christian or something stupid like that i seriously cant imagine what government thing differentiates between any religion and atheism really i could only see them do something morally objectionable with that info give religious or atheists something special good or bad
nottheonion,not_removed,can i write in sith
nottheonion,not_removed,is nihilism a religion yet
nottheonion,not_removed,these kangaroo terrors are nothing next to the power of the force
nottheonion,not_removed,now that its all bound to your identity when if we get a religious nutjob in power theyll know just who to round up turkeys democracy degraded pretty quickly just imagine how easy it would be for them to identify secularists if they kept a named database of all peoples religions and ethnicity hitler wouldnt have needed to have officers find jews hes just have to get an extract from the abs database
nottheonion,not_removed,fuck off ive been jedi the last two census ill not desert the force now
nottheonion,not_removed,surely the problem here is policy makers basing decisions on insufficient back of a fag packet analysis using whatever numbers or percentages that further their cause without the appropriate independent challenge validation bit of a rant but leave the jedis alone p
nottheonion,not_removed,little bit ironic
nottheonion,not_removed,this will only encourage them
nottheonion,not_removed,we had something similar to this happen in the uk only it wasnt jedi but yes wed love to fuck our economy
nottheonion,not_removed,i find their lack of faith disturbing
nottheonion,not_removed,i remember reading about this issue some years ago come on
nottheonion,not_removed,why the fuck is not defined counted as religious there is something wrong with the census
nottheonion,not_removed,i did the same thing with the irish census recently a couple of years ago i put down jedi instead of no religion the problem even though people here are not really religious i only know one person under that goes to mass people always put their official religion down as catholic because of the the government thinks its aok to allow of the schools to be catholic schools funded by the tax payer a lot of those schools then dont allow unbaptised kids into the schools depending on demand some of those same people that cant get their kids in and dont want to baptise them were probably the same people who put catholic down on the cencus form whats more when people talk about this problems the government often talks about bringing in more multidemoniational schools meaning they cover everyone whos christian considering the younger population arent really religious its important to get that on the record and not put down religions because theyre funny or because you were dragged to mass a couple of times a year when you were a kid
nottheonion,not_removed,just remember this year for the first time they are keeping your name and address with your census data indefinitely and no opt out unless you want an fine
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like a path to the dark side
nottheonion,not_removed,whos joking edit haha why is this comment controversial did i accidentally offend some group
nottheonion,not_removed,its not like knowing the actual percentage is going to give atheist organisations tax breaks or anything but it does mean that the the actual demographics for the nation are misrepresented so someone smarter than me should tell me what the potential implications would be
nottheonion,not_removed,kylie sturgess loves science fiction so much that at the last census the radio tutor marked jedi in the religion section i like science fiction and i dont know what jedi has to do with it its from the fantasy genre not necessary bad but not science fiction
nottheonion,not_removed,hey wait is that bill murray in imperial guard garb
nottheonion,not_removed,jedi would be a spiritual eastern way of life not a religion
nottheonion,not_removed,did they try to frighten them with their sorcerers ways
nottheonion,not_removed,hey athiests mind your own business sincerely an athiest
nottheonion,not_removed,jesus was a jedi
nottheonion,not_removed,the more serious issue is how ones beliefs can be denied despite being just as fucking stupid as other beliefs
nottheonion,not_removed,how would you go about proving that they arent
nottheonion,not_removed,why is this news most people dont see jedi as a religion but as a pop culture reference to something representing a moral good thus writing jedi is a humorous way to express a moral position of oneself thus atheists already get what they what depending on who is interpreting the data set that is until too many people take jedi too seriously this is on top of the fact that the target audiencethat is peeps who wrote in jedi represents less than of of australias population so does this actually strike people as humorous or does this lean toward sophomoric
nottheonion,not_removed,great way to see this down with religion
nottheonion,not_removed,why does the census care about your religion and why the fuck should it have an effect on anything
nottheonion,not_removed,you dont believe in the force do you
nottheonion,not_removed,i bet most atheists especially kidsteens living in strict religious houses dont get counted either their parents fill the census for them and put their religion or the kid doesnt dare tick the atheist box and risk their parents seeing it its fucking sad but we have to down estimate the number of religious people there are so many atheists in the closet
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont see it as such a big deal if i were looking at the data id probably assume strong overlap between undefined and not religious especially seeing thousands of jedi on there
nottheonion,not_removed,or you can just not answer that question thats an option as well
nottheonion,not_removed,its not about who laws effect its about what laws go into effect or not in which case it may be relevant to know how much of the country is religious
nottheonion,not_removed,and an excellent snapshot of the time is recording that x number of people felt inclined to declare their religion as jedi
nottheonion,not_removed,which god they talked about
nottheonion,not_removed,what makes you think everyone is joking by writing jediism im completing the census accurately
nottheonion,not_removed,im a proponent for writing in jedi the government has no right to know this information they should not be involving themselves in catering to any religious group in any case no matter what their size i mean why dont they ask that football team you support its the same thing also i know this is australia but i can easily imagine in usa next year giving the wrong answer can be used against you i short writing jedi is a protest vote in support of secular government and privacy that more and more people should engage in
nottheonion,not_removed,and of critical importance to assign the data to your identity data that will be provided to other government departments like the asd or foreign governments in leaks without your knowledge
nottheonion,not_removed,except you can bet your ass that any atheist kids living in a strict religious household will not be marked as atheist even teens wouldnt dare tick that box and risk their parents seeing it we need a better census
nottheonion,not_removed,nah two other guys did it first httptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmainconservationofninjutsu
nottheonion,not_removed,i want to be a sith they always win in poker
nottheonion,not_removed,thats demonic for us christians we call it satanic verses like the quran either submit willingly or by the sword where the fuck is my life star
nottheonion,not_removed,does it matter
nottheonion,not_removed,jaaa we belief in noszing
nottheonion,not_removed,no but the internet misuses it as a synonym for just about everything so it certainly has the appearance of omnipresence
nottheonion,not_removed,you dont have to affiliate with a certain religion to believe in goddivinity in that case youd still be religious in a sense as you definitely wouldnt be an atheist but your specific belief isnt a defined one
nottheonion,not_removed,true theres actually a big push to change it and i think its going to be interesting with the census because i believe no religion will be at the top of the list of religious tick boxes this time im pretty sure the previous top choice was catholicism with no religion hidden down the bottom the theory is people might have been choosing the religion of their parents or the one they learnt in school rather than one they actually practice or identify with australia has a lot of people around by many estimates who have no religion and if the number practicing no religion continues to rise it gives a strong argument against moronic policies like school chaplains a annual program which has effectively replaced a lot of school counsellors in public schools with almost exclusively christian chaplains frequently sourced through large and quite hardline rightwing christian lobbyist groups a lot of public schools also still have optout religious christian classes which in a country where only about are christian is a massive and unfair waste of public money
nottheonion,not_removed,daniel tosh
nottheonion,not_removed,because its a religion the government does not have an official definition for it cant really be denied that jediism is a religion and just as valid as any other it just happens to be nontheistic
nottheonion,not_removed,this makes it totally worthless then anyone who is scared to come out as atheist will have second thoughts on ticking that box we should assume that atheism is more common than statistics show
nottheonion,not_removed,you seem to have offended the sith
nottheonion,not_removed,you do know that spiritual eastern ways of life are religions right
nottheonion,not_removed,more like fascism jedi are authoritarian big statues of heroes indoctrinated kids etc
nottheonion,not_removed,how can you be the athiest when other people are athier than you
nottheonion,not_removed,fyi as a fellow atheist by most standards atheism isnt capitalized as its not a religion and as australian citizens they are entitled to have their nonbeliefs recorded somewhat accurately they pay for it after all
nottheonion,not_removed,id learn how to spell it first
nottheonion,not_removed,well i think its wrong to have in god we trust on the money because we dont all trust in him and its quite an obvious bias to have that clearly since in many states its illegal for atheist to hold office which is fucked up since a right to religion is a fundamental right its just not reasonable it may not hurt anybody directly but it degrades the integrity of the system
nottheonion,not_removed,httpimgurcomaufblb
nottheonion,not_removed,youd have to go take a midichlorian test
nottheonion,not_removed,why would they have to prove anything if they identify as jedis for real then this article wasnt about them
nottheonion,not_removed,except when they do the census theres no category for satire pop culture references so these jedi are now counted as religious and the next time you see the census report policies get planned around data you and several thousand people have just declared yourself religious
nottheonion,not_removed,but this article is about australia
nottheonion,not_removed,um dude christians are a majority in england and it has an official religion which is a christian denomination and the head of state is the head of that denomination and youre posting in a thread about an australian news story
nottheonion,not_removed,actually christian is a majority with around
nottheonion,not_removed,the whole point of a census is to create a picture of who makes up the nation it should care about everything that may play a significant aspect in citizens lives the religion data is used as a guidejustification for a lot of decisions made in the following years people will claim as an overwhelmingly religious country we should have there have been similar campaigns in the uk where people have been urged not just to blindly put down a religion even if they never practice or even think about it it gives skewed data that suggests religious organisations have a greater significance that they actually have
nottheonion,not_removed,if of the population was catholic then youd probably want to make sure your city planning included plenty of churches if of the population was nonreligious funding any religious enterprises would be hard to justify
nottheonion,not_removed,when conducting research a sample of the population is used to make conclusions about the whole population but you want the sample to be as representative as possible religiosity has a big impact on how people perceive the world often in research the sample is not large enough to accommodate those from all backgrounds and so we do our best by grouping subgroups of the population one example is with religion where we might group into christian nonchristian religious and nonreligious if we dont have accurate secondary data then there is going to be an overrepresentation of religious folk in all research including research used to inform policy
nottheonion,not_removed,in switzerland you get asked about your religion for reasons stats money allocation
nottheonion,not_removed,democracy is a two sided coin in return for freedom the price is listening to the opinions of stupid people trust me as a brit i am well aware of the risks of democracy as witnessed by brexit
nottheonion,not_removed,kid ive flown from one side of this galaxy to the other ive seen a lot of strange stuff but ive never seen anything to make me believe theres one allpowerful force controlling everything theres no mystical energy field that controls my destiny its all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense
nottheonion,not_removed,from the governments point of view young atheists in that situation are basically religious the gov doesnt care if you say your prayers before bed or grace at before eating they care what services people will need and use and where to allocate money and resources if youre a young atheist at home with religious parents youll probably get dragged along to church perhaps go to a religious private school etc etc
nottheonion,not_removed,thats how it should work but it doesnt in the uk religious groups talk of only x arent religious
nottheonion,not_removed,well again what would that law then be why would overall religiousness make a difference amount of christians sure amount of everything what would that mean in any way
nottheonion,not_removed,its a census it is used to estimate the demographics of a country youre not really protesting anything or making a difference if an atheist bubbles jedi then its just one less number on atheist so they think that religion is on the rise i mean by all means do what you want but it seems pointless to me i cant see a realistic scenario where the government would come after you for putting down atheistnonreligious especially since secularism is becoming more accepted
nottheonion,not_removed,sometimes theres a secret third but four is just unheard of
nottheonion,not_removed,if youre gonna troll at least do it comprehensibly
nottheonion,not_removed,ayy
nottheonion,not_removed,thats polish spelling not german it should be jaaa ve belief in nossing
nottheonion,not_removed,take the four dollars man
nottheonion,not_removed,skwisgard d
nottheonion,not_removed,i see guess i misunderstood
nottheonion,not_removed,i complained to them about it on their online census feedback form just got a standard cut n paste reply saying the abs has never and will never give out private information yea right the government tried to get the abs to retain identifying census data on the previous censuses but the chief statistician overruled them on privacy grounds what has changed this time around
nottheonion,not_removed,with the loony one nation party in the senate im predicting the census will show a dramatic drop in our moslem population
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah but they dont go by the books they talk about the idea about meaning of life and stuffs even atheists would want to live in a certain way
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree with your sentiment but this is the australian census
nottheonion,not_removed,religion shouldnt effect how the government is run or laws are made religion is not law if it was laws wouldnt even be a thing wed all just be following a religion and believe in what it says is right and wrong law should be based in facts not beliefs
nottheonion,not_removed,christians are not the majority in england people of no religion outnumber christians in england and wales – study
nottheonion,not_removed,from what i hear about australia their government picks and chooses what it takes into consideration and i bet often enough based on the religion of the politicians in power rather than that of the public
nottheonion,not_removed,seems the easiest way to avoid people making that argument is to not collect the data at all
nottheonion,not_removed,well maybe just maybe they should have a better census then like just one followup question on that like do you actively practice said religion
nottheonion,not_removed,and if are jedi
nottheonion,not_removed,funding religious enterprises is hard to justify anyway let people build their own damn churches
nottheonion,not_removed,the same can be said about planning for mosques
nottheonion,not_removed,policy shouldnt be informed by religion
nottheonion,not_removed,money allocation
nottheonion,not_removed,the brexit was a good call though
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,is right out
nottheonion,not_removed,i read it with a jamaican accent
nottheonion,not_removed,noßing
nottheonion,not_removed,most of them do go by books though the reason people in the west think otherwise is because the cultural variants were exported instead of the literal ones its not any different than if they heard about cultural christians and so assumed christianity was uniquely based only on metaphor rather than literalism
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree but it does and wishing it wasnt that way wont change it in the previous census over of people identified as christian catholicanglicanother but only identified as nonreligious now imagine if you were trying to get elected and needed to attempt to keep an electorate made up of a representative group of australian citizens happy it makes sense to appeal to the majority not the minority so the greater shift we see in the numbers will mean more secular based policies gay marriage has taken so long to be on the agenda for australia because politicians still see christians as the majority
nottheonion,not_removed,policies not law for example how many churchestemples etc should there be in any area if the population is religious you get more land zoned for that compared to a population religious
nottheonion,not_removed,nailed it with the picks and chooses bit religion isnt as big here though as it is in the states i dont even know anyone that has been to church since primary school
nottheonion,not_removed,still better not to flat out give them free ammo to use against you make it as difficult as you can it also can stop truly extreme stuff stuff that could cause more of a public outcry
nottheonion,not_removed,all that would achieve is putting everyone in the dark and allowing people to make the argument safe in the knowledge there are no figures that might disprove it
nottheonion,not_removed,so that people who think its funny to put jedi can then think its even funnier to say they actively practice being a jedi
nottheonion,not_removed,or maybe just maybe dont put down a stupid answer to a serious question
nottheonion,not_removed,also i love how the internet jediism websites list an ethos that clearly has nothing to do with the jedi yeah jedi believe strongly in the separation of jediism and state that sounds like exactly what happened in the movies and not just someone clearly depicting their modern secular views and caling them jediism
nottheonion,not_removed,like the man said a census is used to justify actions narrowing down detials making hard to figure out a way to justify any action
nottheonion,not_removed,or consider a response of jedi as a joke answer in the first place and categorize it as spiritual nonreligious
nottheonion,not_removed,do you identify as is enough if you class yourself as a member of a certain faith it means you are religiousregardless of how often you go to services or what you eat
nottheonion,not_removed,theres no incentive to do that at the risk of sounding conspiratorial atheists typically have no power or leverage in governments and religions want to present a normative picture of their religion
nottheonion,not_removed,then the development of the lightsaber and the padawan directives can go right ahead
nottheonion,not_removed,then that death star petition might actually have gotten some support in senate
nottheonion,not_removed,make sure you open up immigration because jedi are celibate
nottheonion,not_removed,theyre listed as unspecified though still religious
nottheonion,not_removed,i couldnt agree more just citing a general example
nottheonion,not_removed,your point being
nottheonion,not_removed,yeahit can be said about most things its usually a good idea for a community to base the amenities it offers on the demographic that exists in that location
nottheonion,not_removed,that may well be so im not making a value judgement on that but thats not necessarily what theyre trying to achieve say you want to consult the populous on abortion so you do a large survey to get a feeling for the views you include demographic questions to map results and make sure theyre representative but fail to include a religion question you get the results back and loandbehold you get a great response rate and it turns out of respondents want abortion made illegal so policy makers freak out and push for it because that is the peoples will but heres the flaw they didnt includes a question on religion if they had they might have noticed that they had a christian response but only have a christian population for example then theyd know that the results are down to a flaw in the methodology perhaps all the surveys were picked up by religious pressure groups who gave them out to all their members its a way to know that the views youre getting arent skewed towards particular people with particular views and thats exactly the problem here inaccurate secondary data means were getting overrepresentions of views from certain groups
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean theres some public budget that goes to cult how much money depends on the popularity of the religion
nottheonion,not_removed,okay the dnc is not the government and wanted to use it against him isnt the same as did use it against him i didnt see any smear campaigns about him being an atheist aside from individuals who complained besides the general trend is still that secularism is becoming more accepted in the us
nottheonion,not_removed,is blasphemy
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont think the amount of jediists caused this
nottheonion,not_removed,well theres still the same amount of christians jews etc in there anyway if a few people screw around it doesnt matter if theyre joking about their religious beliefs then they most likely arent even that faithful or go to church itd honestly be more accurate since youre not wasting the extra resources on the people who say theyre a religion but dont use the churches and people try to use religion for laws too which is mainly where my last comment came from
nottheonion,not_removed,i noticed that even the most nonreligious countries end up with leaders who are actually religious although sometimes they hide a lot if in such a society but it plays in their policies though thats my observation and view though maybe others will find it too negative
nottheonion,not_removed,you got a point there but unfortunately they likely will find a or should i say many way to use data against people
nottheonion,not_removed,this guy knows
nottheonion,not_removed,sometimes the tv remote looks like it moves
nottheonion,not_removed,psst youre on reddit
nottheonion,not_removed,i think that was the point of the article
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont like the way you think
nottheonion,not_removed,what happens to jediism once ed leaves
nottheonion,not_removed,who going into the future is actually going to think that christianity is an overwhelming majority of serious ideology in these places though
nottheonion,not_removed,is there even a single jedi that has adhered to that it seems as though every jedi has a secret lover and children even the canon light side for knights of the old republic has bastilla falling in love with revan and having descendants
nottheonion,not_removed,thats absurd
nottheonion,not_removed,sure but in some parts of the world there is little seperation between the interest of the rulers and the government when trump gets in power i am sure there will be little to none even in usa i can see a realistic scenario where the government would use what you put down in the census form to discredit you even if it was simply to leak the contents of the form to the media to damage your campaign
nottheonion,not_removed,not caused but skewed the numbers even more towards the religious categories when the reality is the kind of person who might put down jedi is almost certainly nonreligious
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah but at this point youre just piggy bagging on another valid issue to soapbox your point did you even read the article theyre requesting atheists not to put jedi as a joke not the religious folk this is because the census will categorise them as religious and the data will show accordingly basically putting in jedi as a joke on the form as the same effect as telling the number crunchers that you are religious they have no sense of humor
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah youre probably right i reckon there is a few pretending to be religious just to come across as a person who may have more morals
nottheonion,not_removed,but could he also give blows
nottheonion,not_removed,just think of the census as having a tag on it
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty obvious the guy he was responding to didnt get that
nottheonion,not_removed,in my vagina
nottheonion,not_removed,im waiting for the footnote
nottheonion,not_removed,the jedi whose stories we follow are the exceptional ones though so that probably includes being the exception that proves the rule
nottheonion,not_removed,newsflash shitty books that are written by nerds living out their sex fantasies dont count
nottheonion,not_removed,if you say so
nottheonion,not_removed,unless if they just have a miscellaneous section with a bunch of smaller religions then they could just throw the jedi portion into the athiest portion not like athiests have churches so they dont need funding and no i didnt read the article my main point was that religion shouldnt influence goverment decisions then someone mentioned church funding i forgot the government helps fund that kind of thing too so the census for religion is needed then but like i said couldnt they just throw the jedi percentage into the athiest percentage its obviously a joke
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks for your support
nottheonion,not_removed,no they cant because you didnt tick the conveniently placed box that says no religion there is no joke box
nottheonion,not_removed,just because someone wrote theyre a jedi knight doesnt mean the people filing it wouldnt realize its not serious no one is that robotic and if they are that anal that theyll write a jedi percentage just because thats what people said then they have no right to bitch they could have fixed it but theyre more worried about writing exactly what was put than the actual data they need and im pretty sure thats not illegal since the government could choose to not recognize it as a religion pretty sure there has to be some requirements to be recognized as a religion even if they arent too strict

nottheonion,not_removed,this is a news article
nottheonion,not_removed,its a great not the onion headline but its a bit misleading campus free speech zones limit free speech by confining it to only to predetermined areas this bill shuts down the zones allowing free speech throughout the campus i hope
nottheonion,not_removed,its counter intuitive both the headline and arizona screams oniony but this is a surprising correction to the good
nottheonion,not_removed,the reasoning is pretty simple if you have free speech in this area then you dont have free speech everywhere else which is you know unconstitutional at least when youre talking about a public university
nottheonion,not_removed,state rep anthony kern is a hypocrite about being opposed to big government he hates it unless its himself

nottheonion,not_removed,appreciate the discretion of using an ipad to voyuer hopefully it was the mini 🤔
nottheonion,not_removed,wasnt this posted on rrelationships a month or so ago from the pov of the woman who was recorded
nottheonion,not_removed,oh okay then youre free to go
nottheonion,not_removed,hey i went to school with him what a dumbass
nottheonion,not_removed,if he has an icloud account that video isnt necessarily gone
nottheonion,not_removed,it took me a minute to realize hes wearing a shirt in the picture
nottheonion,not_removed,holy shit dude an ipad really at least conceal a gopro in a shoe or something an ipad is just like yo im filming you shower dawg im gonna wank over this erry day for the rest of my life
nottheonion,not_removed,how do you say arkansan arecansan arcensawn im more confused about that than the subject matter
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a piss poor excuse
nottheonion,not_removed,i feel oddly bad for the guy he looks so confused give him his fedora
nottheonion,not_removed,its all i could think of in the moment
nottheonion,not_removed,oddly id believe him
nottheonion,not_removed,this is some better call saul fodder here
nottheonion,not_removed,chuck c johnson got loose
nottheonion,not_removed,yup thats exactly what hed look like
nottheonion,not_removed,so she forced him to delete the video and then he later acknowledged making it to authorities after she left and reported him this is why you dont talk to cops not advocating the actual crime here but the guy implicated himself when there was no evidence of it
nottheonion,not_removed,my hometown
nottheonion,not_removed,i believe him thats like getting a fine because you ran a red light and later saying that it was because you tried to run over someone so you unadvertedly ran the light
nottheonion,not_removed,moral of the story dont live in arkansas source am arkansan
nottheonion,not_removed,weird sunburn and tattoos nope tshirt
nottheonion,not_removed,jesse cox strikes again
nottheonion,not_removed,the only time my home town is on reddit
nottheonion,not_removed,that guy reminds me of the amazing atheist
nottheonion,not_removed,that shirt was a mistake
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt that simon from the yogscast
nottheonion,not_removed,i live minutes from jonesboro you could probably make a subpar florida man sub just from what goes on in and around jonesboro im glad im moving away for college in a few weeks
nottheonion,not_removed,smooth
nottheonion,not_removed,oh well that makes it alright then due to the law of reciprocity it is not weird or illegal if you planned to make an ass of yourself said no one ever
nottheonion,not_removed,wasnt this a story on reddit
nottheonion,not_removed,if she had deleted the video then why admit there was ever a video typically you need some evidence to be convicted not just a he saidshe said
nottheonion,not_removed,oh arkansas
nottheonion,not_removed,photo checks out
nottheonion,not_removed,saw this today same guy
nottheonion,not_removed,is this who reddit calls a neckbeard
nottheonion,not_removed,who else thought he had a wacky chest tat instead of a shirt on in the thumbnail
nottheonion,not_removed,urine big trouble pal
nottheonion,not_removed,at first i thought this town was doing some sort of eye for an eye type justice here you take unsolicited nude photos of women so well take nude mug shots disappointed by the shirt but still very interested in seeing it
nottheonion,not_removed,he never intended to tape womenthe hillary defense no charges file case closed
nottheonion,not_removed,who runs for the ipad when trying to take creepshots this dude must have been pretty desperate to see her naked edit doesnt the thumb look like hes got gross fat guy skin and is wearing a bustier
nottheonion,not_removed,it took me awhile to realize hes wearing a shirt i want one
nottheonion,not_removed,they misspelled florida
nottheonion,not_removed,lotta people in this thread saying hes either dumb or at least a bit decent to have admitted taping her when the evidence was deleted maybe he just knows a bit about tech its perfectly possible for a forensics person to get the file back even though its been deleted so trying to pretend he didnt do it is only going to make matters worse once hes been arrested
nottheonion,not_removed,waiwaitwait i feel that the fact this man had a fiancé should be part of the headline like this man having a fiancé is pretty weird news in and of itself
nottheonion,not_removed,i cant be the only person that thought this dude was shirtless with weird tattoos on his chest
nottheonion,not_removed,so this may get buried but holy shit this dude went to my high school he was definitely the dumbass of our grade i worked at arbys with him for a little bit and he would be outside smoking the cigarettes from the outdoor ash trays on break he also had the most cringe worthy talent show performance ever too im just loling so hard at this
nottheonion,not_removed,ha
nottheonion,not_removed,well thats better
nottheonion,not_removed,they havent wrapped up game of thrones yet
nottheonion,not_removed,oh god this is in my hometown great one more reason for me to gtfo of here
nottheonion,not_removed,be me
nottheonion,not_removed,i feel like well soon see a submission similar to this on the tifu sub
nottheonion,not_removed,so did the cops find a video of him peeing its clearly a bullshit story by a desperate pervert
nottheonion,not_removed,there goes my plan of putting up a sign saying hot ladies can use my bathroom for showering
nottheonion,not_removed,aw man if i ever run into this guy im going to tell him to stop stealing my moves
nottheonion,not_removed,is he wearing a wonder woman costume in the picture
nottheonion,not_removed,ive seen this picture pop up for the last several hours and just now realized hes wearing a shirt i thought he was shirtless with some weird chest tattoo
nottheonion,not_removed,this is my nightmare
nottheonion,not_removed,first thoughts disgusting as fuck
nottheonion,not_removed,he should have stuck to recording women
nottheonion,not_removed,i cant tell whether or not he is wearing a shirt
nottheonion,not_removed,this is so odd either way its just why
nottheonion,not_removed,nice nipple tattoo
nottheonion,not_removed,dude i can believe that i do dumb shit all the time and get caught up in misunderstandings
nottheonion,not_removed,i think he had an entirely different shower in mind
nottheonion,not_removed,that shirt made it look like he was wearing nothing but a bikini in the thumbnail
nottheonion,not_removed,insert joke he looks like a redditor
nottheonion,not_removed,hope she went into the recently deleted folder too
nottheonion,not_removed,soooo its not cool to make your own pee vids
nottheonion,not_removed,that expression in the thumbnail
nottheonion,not_removed,hes probably pissed
nottheonion,not_removed,he got to much duck sauce sucking on sworrdss now boy hey look its dat boi
nottheonion,not_removed,i hate that i live in arkansas shouldnt have taken living in america for granted ill get back one day dang it one day
nottheonion,not_removed,looks like he mains mei
nottheonion,not_removed,i completely thought his skin was all blotchy and that he had weird triangle boob tattoos
nottheonion,not_removed,well lets be honest who hasnt been there lol
nottheonion,not_removed,he was just doing a squat cobbler tis all
nottheonion,not_removed,as someone who does weird sex things and is also absent minded enough to probably leave weird sex stuff out for people in my house to find i believe him
nottheonion,not_removed,oooooh thats a shirt ive passed over this article about six times now and always thought he had some skin disorder and weird tattoos
nottheonion,not_removed,i actually started a job where he worked a few years ago i was not there long at all and he was one of the main reasons he was creepy as hell and told me the first day he met me that he liked to go to the local mall and jack it in the parking lot
nottheonion,not_removed,fucking creep
nottheonion,not_removed,you do you
nottheonion,not_removed,well she fucked up deleting the video if it also included him peeing he would be off scott free
nottheonion,not_removed,neckbeards
nottheonion,not_removed,looking at him i say both are possible
nottheonion,not_removed,rjustneckbeardthings
nottheonion,not_removed,how would you say arkansan then
nottheonion,not_removed,as much as i pee im pissin away gold
nottheonion,not_removed,i must know whats on his shirt
nottheonion,not_removed,doesnt have to be a good excuse just has to hold up in court not sure this is either
nottheonion,not_removed,holy shit lol this guy is from my town
nottheonion,not_removed,they gunna use that neckbeard
nottheonion,not_removed,i have just one question how do you pronounce arkansan
nottheonion,not_removed,if youre gonna make something really stupid up at least dont embarrass yourself in the process come up with something like you planted the camera there to make sure that if anybody ever breaks into her home you have the burglar on tape i mean any lie really is better than saying you wanted to tape yourself peeing and putting it up on some weird ass website ya dummy
nottheonion,not_removed,i know arkansas is pronounced like arkansaw but how are you supposed to pronounce arkansan arkansan arkansawan
nottheonion,not_removed,damn jonesbro
nottheonion,not_removed,oops my bad
nottheonion,not_removed,at first take his shirt makes it look like he was in a scalding hot water accident
nottheonion,not_removed,they didnt have to show his picture thats cruel
nottheonion,not_removed,oh thats my friend shari she just came over to use the shower
nottheonion,not_removed,couldnt tell if that was a shirt or what was going on
nottheonion,not_removed,he has a fiancé
nottheonion,not_removed,only clicked to see if he was wearing a shirt in the mugshot still not sure
nottheonion,not_removed,did anyone else just realize hes wearing a shirt i thought he was shirtless and had tattoos
nottheonion,not_removed,is it just me or is this the same guy from
nottheonion,not_removed,i have got to see that shirt
nottheonion,not_removed,guys i found it edit think its a different guy
nottheonion,not_removed,who the hell videotapes themselves urinating
nottheonion,not_removed,arkansas the new florida
nottheonion,not_removed,to film himself urinating wat
nottheonion,not_removed,im so done with this state so glad that im going home tomorrow to hell with this state and its stupid people and stupid archaeology
nottheonion,not_removed,how the fuck would you pronounce arkansan
nottheonion,not_removed,ok he is creepy but why would this woman go to his place and take a shower
nottheonion,not_removed,honestly thought this was a guy i knew if it would have been him though his excuse would have been true
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean its plausible i get off on a pov peeing video from time to time
nottheonion,not_removed,i went to nettleton high school with this guy had had a strength and conditioning class with him he ended up popping his knee outta place in it and had to go to the er he was a quiet dude in high school really distant he was picked on a lot
nottheonion,not_removed,where his fiancee also lived this dick has a fiancee or should i say had
nottheonion,not_removed,so he went from being a standard watching women creep to a super pervert watching myself pee creep he didnt think this one through did he
nottheonion,not_removed,this isnt oniony enough please remove there is no better place to take a long piss than in the womens showers they know me at the ymca
nottheonion,not_removed,whatthefuck
nottheonion,not_removed,shouldnt have done it but every guy has thought about it
nottheonion,not_removed,i actually feel sorry for him
nottheonion,not_removed,httpmimgurcomxzwyuuo
nottheonion,not_removed,technically its arkansawyer
nottheonion,not_removed,so a newspaper based in arkansas starts a story with arkansan accused of i thought maybe it was another state dissin folks from arkansas hell no arkansass proud of her people
nottheonion,not_removed,how do you even pronounce arkansan is it arkanson that doesnt sound right
nottheonion,not_removed,he looks like the amazing atheist in that thumbnail
nottheonion,not_removed,haha film himself urinating what a shitty excuse
nottheonion,not_removed,he looks like the amazing atheist
nottheonion,not_removed,riiiiiiightand why exactly did you set up a camera in your bathroom why are you doing this with other people let alone a woman who had just asked to use your shower no less in your house honestly the thought processes of people these days
nottheonion,not_removed,it doesnt matter either way he should get justice served to him as soon as possible
nottheonion,not_removed,i hate to break it to you fatboy slim but nobody believes you do you honestly expect someone to believe that there is anybody on the planet who will pay you for a video of you peeing or that you forgot the camera was there and recording when she went in to shower no not one seven billion people on earth and not one single person is that stupid or hard up however it is perfectly believable that you rushed into the bathroom to set up your phone to film your guest showering that sort of shit happens all the time freak i bet you stand under stairs to shoot upskirt videos too
nottheonion,not_removed,please dont be muslim please dont be muslim phew
nottheonion,not_removed,sooo random woman ask random house owner if she can take a shower at his house guy asks his fiance she says yes then the strange woman finds that ipad in the bath aaafter undressing and after showering and then calls police on that guy and sues him sounds kinda fishy to me i think that strange woman on that day had many shower sessions or the day before just to find someone she can sue for money and apparently an apple user is rich for her while the houses before were probably much more professional in hiding cameras than this poor guy wanna making easy money with peepee videos
nottheonion,not_removed,what a catch quick ladies before someone snatches him up lol
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought it was okay to record people in the bathroom now isnt that was they was bitching about all spring
nottheonion,not_removed,i believe him he looks like a feminist with no sex drive
nottheonion,not_removed,lets take a moment to really look at this note the sad vacant stare the loss the loneliness in those eyes these are the eyes of a man who has spent countless hours days even watching innumerable women from afar silently rehearsing moment after moment of what he would say if he actually grew confident enough to speak to one of them in his head we could watch the replays of a thousand identical fantasies with a thousand different women who he believes secretly desire him and yet is completely unaware of their hungering need for him every smile is meant for him every strand of windswept hair is by his mere silent command oh yes this is a man who is beyond diluted if we could submit an image to be immortalized beside the word pathetic in the dictionary i have no doubt this would win if not a top contender
nottheonion,not_removed,as a male with no such proclivities i cant even begin to understand why some guys do these things the average woman is going to be fugly without clothes why record that you can just type pron into google edit it stays fuck you
nottheonion,not_removed,i go to college in jonesboro great college horrible city
nottheonion,not_removed,what about videos of other people peeing
nottheonion,not_removed,from jonesboro can confirm that and meth
nottheonion,not_removed,from jonesboro left before i killed myself its a fucking awful town
nottheonion,not_removed,open and shut case johnson
nottheonion,not_removed,in jonesboro as we speak grew up in paragould you could go to a movie or hang out at walmart jonesboro at least has a mall and laser tag lol
nottheonion,not_removed,his face says urinepornreditor in allcaps bold typeface
nottheonion,not_removed,my first thought was this guys a redditor
nottheonion,not_removed,how the hell does this guy have a fiancee
nottheonion,not_removed,plot twist its you isnt it
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe she was visiting overnight or maybe her water was shut off
nottheonion,not_removed,its the newest fad after pokemon go only less weird
nottheonion,not_removed,but only after i use it first
nottheonion,not_removed,i can relate to the both of these acts she would rather have her privacy kept than sue the guy and he was at least a little bit honest
nottheonion,not_removed,they live in my hometown of jonesboro arkansas
nottheonion,not_removed,hey its only a couple iq points
nottheonion,not_removed,he could had easily used that in his favor if he thought the whole thing through before being questioned in fact i can see this being dropped with out evidence
nottheonion,not_removed,what does that have to do with flint
nottheonion,not_removed,i though he was shirtless at first and just had badly disfigured nipples
nottheonion,not_removed,its a wolf shirt pretty okay as far as wolf shirts go though
nottheonion,not_removed,if he really was smart he would have uploaded hundreds of vids of himself peeing to xhamster beforehand so at least he had plausible deniability what i dont get about guys who upload vids of themselves jacking off to porn sites is how they think they will get any views why anyone who clicks on them accidentally would stay for more than an instant the secret is to get high quality desirable porn especially amateur stuff and randomly intersperse second clips of you jerking off or pissing throughout if the porn is hot enough theyre going to just have to deal with it also unless youre so rockbottom that you dont care if people recognize you its pretty important to make sure your surroundings are as nondescript as possible a friend of mine once went out with a very handsome lawyer she thought was the one but had a panic attack when she went in his apartment and recognized the computer desk and wallpaper from the literally dozens of videos that were posted on xhamster of a guy jacking off onto pictures of her printed off her instagram that he lighted on fire after he came he grabbed her arm when he realized that she knew but she screamed her head off and her neighbor kicked open the door she wanted to get attempted rape charges but there wasnt enough proof but he was charged with harassment got his picture in the paper which ruined his career and has a foot restraining order
nottheonion,not_removed,but one story makes him a criminal and the other makes him not though i dont really believe him there are weird guys who would do this but i doubt theyd be stupid enough to get noticed doing it in a womens shower
nottheonion,not_removed,jesus i thought those were tats
nottheonion,not_removed,why didnt he just say i took a shit earlier and had the ipad setup to watch youtube videos sorry i left it in here end of story
nottheonion,not_removed,i have flux on so it just looks like a ham themed shirt
nottheonion,not_removed,from the thumbnail i thought it was a fat guy in a dress
nottheonion,not_removed,not every fat person with a beard is a gentlesir there are different kinds of creeps out there i get an idiot scumbag who doesnt think more than one step ahead vibe from this guy
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like a viable legal defense to me
nottheonion,not_removed,or he is the howtobasic guy
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah this is one of those situations where he just keeps digging himself deeper and deeper its probably best to just admit that he did it then face the consequences adding more things to a already creepy incident is just going to backfire
nottheonion,not_removed,a creepy pile of what now
nottheonion,not_removed,i get the feeling its some kind of mra furry brony trump shit
nottheonion,not_removed,it was the pro
nottheonion,not_removed,that was my thought when i saw the headline this could be another case but theres a good chance its the same one
nottheonion,not_removed,link
nottheonion,not_removed,i am pretty sure i read it too
nottheonion,not_removed,not sure how many of them claim they were just trying to film themselves but setting up spycams in bathrooms to film women peeing is creepily common ive known of two different people it happened to
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,what was the relationship between these two like
nottheonion,not_removed,im sure ive read this story here roffmychest or rtwoxchromosomes maybe
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,james comey
nottheonion,not_removed,describe his personality
nottheonion,not_removed,waddup fam me too and the thunder rolls
nottheonion,not_removed,fellow jonesboro resident checking in
nottheonion,not_removed,reddit demands a yearbook pic
nottheonion,not_removed,hey hes my cousin what a dumbass lol
nottheonion,not_removed,same here i was gonna say those appear to be very recent tattoos haha
nottheonion,not_removed,first one
nottheonion,not_removed,you say the last two syllables exactly like kansan as in people from kansas just put an unstressed ar in front
nottheonion,not_removed,doesnt matter arkansawyer isnt supposedly the correct term a source
nottheonion,not_removed,arkansawyer is also acceptable
nottheonion,not_removed,nice one
nottheonion,not_removed,right after this voyeurism just wont do it for him anymore so hell upgrade to squat cobbling
nottheonion,not_removed,arkansas
nottheonion,not_removed,whats the problem he did actually do it and hes willing to admit to that and accept the punishment he sounds like a decent guy who just made a mistake
nottheonion,not_removed,its more like saying you ran the red light because you shit yourself if youre gonna lie make it embarrassing so its more believable
nottheonion,not_removed,you believe that before letting a girl shower in his bathroom he wanted to real quick film a fetish video of himself which happened to be on an ipad that he happened to accidentally leave filming after quickly filming himself peeing for this fetish video this ipad video which happened to be positioned to see the shower he knew she was going to use you really believe hes not just trying to avoid more sexual harassment charges you think his thought when she asked to shower was shit i wanted to film myself peeing first better make sure i go do that before she showers for this video im not uploading any time soon indicated by the fact that he then left it filming in the bathroom after he finished peeing to go let her shower likeno way he was literally just caught doing something really predatorial and tried to lie about it badly with a really half assed lie and you believe it instead of believing that hes just a fucking predator edit also your analogy is wrong its more like running someone over then saying you were driving sleeping as a defense you did something horrifying to someone else and then pretended it was shameful neglect
nottheonion,not_removed,so as a native how do you pronounce arkansan
nottheonion,not_removed,thats what i thought too i clicked to see if i could get a better idea of this weird sunburntattoo that seemed untouched by sun also wondering why theyd take a shirtless mug shot nope just a oddly burnt flesh color t shirt
nottheonion,not_removed,that is probably because hes a fat loser
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont think thats the first mistake hes made in his life
nottheonion,not_removed,probably didnt want to lie it can be scary if youve never been arrested or been in serious trouble the guy mightve just felt guilty about it or something was he actually convicted or just charged mightve just gotten a fine and sent away since the video was deleted or maybe he has an icloud account which might mean the video wasnt deleted who knows
nottheonion,not_removed,was thinking exactly the same thing
nottheonion,not_removed,do you think they would spend the resource to do that also you cant get a warrant for his phone on hearsay especially if that someone cannot take the oath of affirmation without any tangible evidence i think he would have gotten off
nottheonion,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtcwpihjiexa
nottheonion,not_removed,what was the performance
nottheonion,not_removed,hes wearing a shirt
nottheonion,not_removed,me too
nottheonion,not_removed,im here to fix the cable
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,you dont understand art
nottheonion,not_removed,rgaywatersports nsfw
nottheonion,not_removed,youve never recorded yourself pissing weirdo faggot strangeo
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds plausible enough
nottheonion,not_removed,wait archaeology
nottheonion,not_removed,i know youre getting downvoted to hell for saying arkansas is a pile of shit but as someone who is leaving in december i wholeheartedly agree with you
nottheonion,not_removed,rcanzen is how we pronounce it here in ar emphasis on the can
nottheonion,not_removed,its pretty common among friends here god i need a shower can i use yours real quick i wont make a mess definitely something ive asked before at a friends house maybe his fiancée is a good friend of hers so she felt fine about it who knows
nottheonion,not_removed,you er saying its er weird to er film yourself pissing so you know you can send it to your mum on facebook
nottheonion,not_removed,how about we not record naked people
nottheonion,not_removed,arkansawyerintheshower
nottheonion,not_removed,youre correct its arkansan pronounced arcanson httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiadjectivalsanddemonymsforusstates
nottheonion,not_removed,nah this is pretty minor as these things go so hell get cited and released on bond if its his first offense time getting caught hell probably get probation a fine and community service
nottheonion,not_removed,i couldnt help but picture a smug year old writing this comment
nottheonion,not_removed,hey upleasedintbemuslim
nottheonion,not_removed,no the guy doesnt ask his fiance it just mentions that she lives there not that he asked her anything the guy told the girl that she could shower but he needed to use the bathroom first he went in and set up his ipad to record her showering she didnt notice the ipad til after she got out of the shower and when she confronted him about it he admitted that he was recording her his last ditch effort is to make up a story about him recording himself peeing and then forgetting that the ipad was recording
nottheonion,not_removed,upleasedontbemuslim
nottheonion,not_removed,is everybody trying to be subredditsimulator now
nottheonion,not_removed,that was way too specific to not be projection man
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah its almost like he wanted to see her naked or something i cant fathom it either
nottheonion,not_removed,my dad graduated from college in jonesboro great college horrible father
nottheonion,not_removed,howl yeah
nottheonion,not_removed,you actually like asu im sosurprised
nottheonion,not_removed,this place is probably the least shitty part of our state to be fair its just so fucking boring
nottheonion,not_removed,who are you
nottheonion,not_removed,what college is there
nottheonion,not_removed,most of arkansas is horrible fellow arkansan
nottheonion,not_removed,the streaming is high quality
nottheonion,not_removed,how could you make a video about pissin
nottheonion,not_removed,welcome to arkansas come for the meth stay because you traded your car for the meth
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought they shut down galaxy
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a bold typeface you imagined
nottheonion,not_removed,hello
nottheonion,not_removed,he stands as a symbol of all of us
nottheonion,not_removed,my first thought was buying cakes or pies whatever in better call saul
nottheonion,not_removed,he seems more like someone from
nottheonion,not_removed,glad i wasnt the only one
nottheonion,not_removed,i bet he doesnt anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,the first rule of the universe everyone can get a fiancéeexcept you
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah its him and totally not me
nottheonion,not_removed,ive only air bnbd when the property owner was gone ive never crossed bathroom paths with someone im air bnbing from
nottheonion,not_removed,and here ive been wasting all this time putting cameras in the neighbors bathrooms when i could have just waited for them to come to me
nottheonion,not_removed,if i got out of the shower and found video from some dudes ipad had been recording me id just act normal take the ipad with me and go straight to the podiddley with it
nottheonion,not_removed,same pretty standard stuff
nottheonion,not_removed,from the thumbnail i thought it was a strapless bra on a sunburned guy
nottheonion,not_removed,and a really veiny chest
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought it was tattoos
nottheonion,not_removed,me too i was like what is wrong with his skin
nottheonion,not_removed,i kept thinking they were tattoos and that he had weird splotchy skin
nottheonion,not_removed,omg i thought something was wrong with me when i realized it was just a shirt im so glad someone else thought it looked like an illfitting skinsuit of one of his victims or you know that his nips are weird
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought it was a tattoo and a really bad sunburn
nottheonion,not_removed,were you already familiar with that shirt or did you find that pic using the tiny bit available in the image of the dude from the linked article if its the latter color me impressed
nottheonion,not_removed,kind of a dope shirt
nottheonion,not_removed,id actually wear that
nottheonion,not_removed,kindof reminds me of those shirts we would sell in elementary school to save endangered animals and shit and if you sold of them you could get a cassette tape player
nottheonion,not_removed,wait what
nottheonion,not_removed,i wonder how long it would take a lawyer to read a foot restraining order
nottheonion,not_removed,that never happened
nottheonion,not_removed,link to article
nottheonion,not_removed,i have no idea what to say in response to that so heres httpsyoutubetvcpqsetmgi
nottheonion,not_removed,it kind of sounds like the guy in your story didnt actually do anything illegal maybe grabbing her arm if that could be consider assault or false imprisonment but its not illegal to film yourself printing a picture from the internet jerking off on it and setting it on fire then post the video on the internet
nottheonion,not_removed,cool story except literally none of this is real go back to rtifu or rtwoxchromosomes
nottheonion,not_removed,xhamster doesnt allow pee hed have better luck at pornhub or eroprofile or motherless
nottheonion,not_removed,yet she watched literally dozens of videos posted on xhamster that showed some anonymous guy jacking off onto pictures of her sound to me like she was asking for it
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah i cant see this guy making some kind of idiotic mistake while creating his masterpiece
nottheonion,not_removed,it was his shower in his house he was letting a friend use it
nottheonion,not_removed,while i agree with the first part of your statement i have to ask does your house have separate mens and womens showers
nottheonion,not_removed,i set it down when i had to wipe
nottheonion,not_removed,that was plan b if the i was recording my own piss for pornographic purposes argument fails which it shouldnt its ironclad then plan b was to dress up as peter griffin pretending to be a woman then make a run for the border
nottheonion,not_removed,went to high school with dude can confirm that he was total neckbeard he would wear the neckbeard uniform fedora fingerless gloves with a flame button up shirt guy fieriesque and an all over print anime shirt
nottheonion,not_removed,hes about to learn that hes not as clever as he thinks he is
nottheonion,not_removed,turns out that it wasnt an ipad at all it was actually the macbook
nottheonion,not_removed,but all the other details line up
nottheonion,not_removed,it did and i remember that op said she uses an iphone and did not know how to use his phone
nottheonion,not_removed,zelda
nottheonion,not_removed,good to know some shit in that subreddit is real
nottheonion,not_removed,its under ginger showers
nottheonion,not_removed,threads there dont typically include identifying details
nottheonion,not_removed,standup nice guy with wonderful taste in shirts
nottheonion,not_removed,spent a lot of time filming girls urinating
nottheonion,not_removed,dumbass lol
nottheonion,not_removed,you know that attitude only serves to fuel confirmation bias right and the only thing that results is weird people catching hell for being weird despite not actually doing anything youre not going to guess who does messed up shit by how they look or whether or not you could totally tell that they would do something weird the world would be a much better place if you could but thats just not how it works
nottheonion,not_removed,i get where this question is coming from but is that really the standard by which we will judge this guy
nottheonion,not_removed,haha yes made that talent show
nottheonion,not_removed,astate student here cant wait to get the f out of jonesboro love the college hate the city
nottheonion,not_removed,yes went to nettleton
nottheonion,not_removed,this guy gets it
nottheonion,not_removed,imma have to disagree with the decent here no decent human being films people in the shower without their consent
nottheonion,not_removed,now i picture one of those movie scenes where the driver tells the cop he shit himself then the scene jumpcuts to his full police escort to the next public bathroom
nottheonion,not_removed,you just say kansan as in a kansas resident like a pirate but yeah dont live here its like a discount alabama with all of the racism and paranoia intact
nottheonion,not_removed,arecanzen emphasis on the can but not too much emphasis
nottheonion,not_removed,arkansan is pronounced r k n z n
nottheonion,not_removed,the cops let him keep his shirt off for the photo because they couldnt get enough of those badass fresh tats haha
nottheonion,not_removed,hey im glad most criminals are morons who will self incriminate just pointing out it was the wrong thing to do for him even if he would still be convicted lack of evidence can effect plea deals offered or even sentencing
nottheonion,not_removed,he did a dance at some point it was pretty much a yearly meme to see him in the school talent show
nottheonion,not_removed,yea i spent minutes looking at it
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks for that nsfw tag
nottheonion,not_removed,httpsimgurcomgalleryhlfei
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe he was just trying to check his form
nottheonion,not_removed,im here doing a archaeological survey
nottheonion,not_removed,depends on the area tbh
nottheonion,not_removed,i left years ago god speed
nottheonion,not_removed,interesting a new yorker says thanks for the info
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty sure thats odd unless youre staying with them or the water is out you wouldnt even have a change of clothing and the only reason youd need a shower is from sweating and putting sweaty clothes back on would probably feel even more disgusting or at least make it not worth the effort
nottheonion,not_removed,yes i am
nottheonion,not_removed,well ideally yeah
nottheonion,not_removed,idk man here if you can prove it its a serious offense and if its a repeate i think its like years in prison these laws vary from state to state though
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds quite a soft way to deal with him i am just thinking about women who got videos of them taking shower all over the internet now
nottheonion,not_removed,orit could be just maybe that he reminds me of an old friend who was exactly like that
nottheonion,not_removed,some of it is beautiful up north the southern part is fucking terrible source am here also
nottheonion,not_removed,i used to be in sales and arkansas was part of my territory my first trip there i couldnt believe how vast the differences were throughout the state but more than that i was surprised how empty it was between major population areas just vast swaths of nothingness favorite area was the northwest beautiful hill country fayetteville was really cool loved the ua campus it reminded me of another ua tuscaloosa al just on a hill edit by nothingness i meant more rural than i expected im from alabama and im used to rural but there seemed to be miles of forest or rice fields sometimes that seemed to never end and no houses for miles and miles alabama has rural parts arkansas is mostly rural as fuck
nottheonion,not_removed,only the northwest is worth living in the rest is trash
nottheonion,not_removed,can confirm lived in fort smith it was terrible fayetteville is nice but very small
nottheonion,not_removed,come to northwest arkansas plenty to do and see up here
nottheonion,not_removed,your username made me laugh
nottheonion,not_removed,they renovated the old bowling center its called hijinx now it has obstacle courses foam pits laser tag an arcade and bowling of course lol it looks like a strip club at night though
nottheonion,not_removed,no all caps would not recommend
nottheonion,not_removed,hes a top tier squat cobbler thats for sure
nottheonion,not_removed,eh hes got a pretty typical reddit neckbeard though id expect him to look grosser if he was from but maybe im giving you guys too much credit
nottheonion,not_removed,there is overlap in the reddit and userbase so this neckbeard might be both p
nottheonion,not_removed,happy second cake day usweatybutthole
nottheonion,not_removed,nownow i feel like if she is aware of his career as a pee pornstar then she must be pretty open minded and believe it was an honest mistake
nottheonion,not_removed,actually i feel like whatever person would want to marry him is also really fucked up
nottheonion,not_removed,i live in an apartment building that was a hostel decades ago with units about half are airbnb and most of those are just rooms no bathroom there are four public bathrooms having strangers in the hallways going to the bathroom is extremely common
nottheonion,not_removed,i only air bnb at places with ipads in the bathrooms
nottheonion,not_removed,i need to shower can i use yours
nottheonion,not_removed,i meanthe police will still see it perhaps she didnt even want that
nottheonion,not_removed,i would just take the ipad if they complained id report it
nottheonion,not_removed,and turn yourself in for theft
nottheonion,not_removed,uh id be lying if i said it hasnt happened previously just google jonesboro man camera in bathroom and take a look at the first several links
nottheonion,not_removed,just barfed all over myself thanks its everywhere
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought they were pasties
nottheonion,not_removed,thats normal for people like him its called gingervitis
nottheonion,not_removed,i own that shirt and just recognized it lol
nottheonion,not_removed,you heard him
nottheonion,not_removed,well clearly she had a fetish for jacking off to xhamster videos of a guy jacking off onto pictures of her printed off her instagram and when a lucky coincidence brought them together she got cold feet
nottheonion,not_removed,if he really was smart he would have uploaded hundreds of vids of himself peeing to xhamster beforehand so at least he had plausible deniability what i dont get about guys who upload vids of themselves jacking off to porn sites is how they think they will get any views why anyone who clicks on them accidentally would stay for more than an instant the secret is to get high quality desirable porn especially amateur stuff and randomly intersperse second clips of you jerking off or pissing throughout if the porn is hot enough theyre going to just have to deal with it also unless youre so rockbottom that you dont care if people recognize you its pretty important to make sure your surroundings are as nondescript as possible a friend of mine once went out with a very handsome lawyer she thought was the one but had a panic attack when she went in his apartment and recognized the computer desk and wallpaper from the literally dozens of videos that were posted on xhamster of a guy jacking off onto pictures of her printed off her instagram that he lighted on fire after he came he grabbed her arm when he realized that she knew but she screamed her head off and her neighbor kicked open the door she wanted to get attempted rape charges but there wasnt enough proof but he was charged with harassment got his picture in the paper which ruined his career and has a foot restraining order thats what
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like falmolilu is a crazy schizophrenic
nottheonion,not_removed,longer than a politician interviewing pages
nottheonion,not_removed,keep in mind the story is reddit bullshit and not real in any way
nottheonion,not_removed,assuming its a real story im not sure how much to read into the fact that this is the users only post — maybe its a burner to protect their friend but even then i would have expected responses and clarifications it could count as indecent exposure to send somebody unsolicited nude videos if he repeatedly sent her the videos when she asked him to stop thats harassment if he took her photo without her permission theres an argument for stalking and if the photo was taken on private property theres likeness rights as for grabbing her arm theres situations where that could be abuse although the user claims he was charged with harassment not abuse mind you that all relies on filling in the gaps with your imagination you could go the other way if he was printing out a photo she posted herself wasnt using her name and she happened to find the videos herself that paints a very different picture devil see details there would still be a copyright issue in using the photo in his videos though
nottheonion,not_removed,grabbing somones arm against their will is definetly assault also you can jerk off to what every you want and post it online but if its always a picture of the same person and you send them videos then its harassment
nottheonion,not_removed,well putting a bunch of videos with your picture being cummed all over on porn sites would definitely be harassment and a restraining order not to mention grabbing her arm when she was probably trying to leave when youve been creeping all over this girl would definitely seem suspicious and if the neighbor had time to come kick the door in he didnt let her go right away from a moral standpoint he should have been charged with more but its something thats so out there and weird that they dont know what to charge him with for the offense and they didnt have enough evidence to prove beyond a doubt that he intended to rape her even if thats what he was going to do definitely should have gotten sexual harassment
nottheonion,not_removed,people like you are the reason why trump is the gop nominee
nottheonion,not_removed,or yknow the story could be bullshit we need links for research
nottheonion,not_removed,my guess is that if the story is true were missing the part where the guy is sending the videos to her which could definitely constitute harassment
nottheonion,not_removed,she was asking for what this creep to rape her
nottheonion,not_removed,why didnt you say masterpiss why
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,its like a living caricature
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah sure you can use my shower just ignore the guy holding the boom mike in there
nottheonion,not_removed,dude he is obviously more of a sitdown type of guy come on
nottheonion,not_removed,every time i scroll past this picture i think the shirt is actually his skin and it creeps me out even more
nottheonion,not_removed,voted most likely to pee in porn
nottheonion,not_removed,eloquently stated
nottheonion,not_removed,way to expound on your previous comment
nottheonion,not_removed,i knew you were creepy
nottheonion,not_removed,astate employee here and a resident of jonesboro i dont blame you you originally from here what is it you hate about it
nottheonion,not_removed,this i was about to say he isnt decent but at least hes honest but then i realize filming people shower without their consent isnt honest either the best thing i could think for his defense that at least he felt guilty enough about it to confess to it when he was confronted which isnt much really
nottheonion,not_removed,aw poor guy thats rough
nottheonion,not_removed,my brain broke watching those
nottheonion,not_removed,ah i see
nottheonion,not_removed,and its really weird too it is nearly a capital offense to say arkansas in arkansaw and we have the very old rarely used arkansawyer arkansawyer that uses the correct pronunciation but sounds too hillbilly so we are left with a demonym that is based in the unacceptable place name pronunciationarkansan arkansan strange little state this
nottheonion,not_removed,hey buddy fuck you for asking reasonable questions
nottheonion,not_removed,well then i better tell my mate to stop doing that then he must be a pervert my mate that is
nottheonion,not_removed,how would you deal with a firsttime offender who would normally just be facing probation a fine and community service because thats a perfectlyappropriate sentence
nottheonion,not_removed,im from little rock go to uark moving back to fayetteville in a few weeks cant wait
nottheonion,not_removed,as someone moving to nw arkansas in a couple years this makes me happy
nottheonion,not_removed,move back to fayetteville in a few weeks for school
nottheonion,not_removed,ouch worst part by far always dread that stretch on road trips to lousianna or florida
nottheonion,not_removed,im a neckbeard
nottheonion,not_removed,he doesnt have any type of neckbeard just a beard whats a pretty typical reddit neckbeard in your world
nottheonion,not_removed,as far as most of my home state is concerned this is just a bump in the road
nottheonion,not_removed,oh she was definitely in on it
nottheonion,not_removed,sure but make pouty faces into the north corner of the bathroom whilst fondling yourself
nottheonion,not_removed,not only will they see it but you risk them downloading it themselves police arent unicorns they can be creeps too
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a good point
nottheonion,not_removed,in that same vein i believe a gynecologist from jonesboro was arrested not to long ago for something similar edit it was actually in paragould ar right outside of jonesboro
nottheonion,not_removed,woah
nottheonion,not_removed,can i film that
nottheonion,not_removed,that would be amazing if the actual dude from that article showed up in this thread can you imagine the downvotes
nottheonion,not_removed,congratulations we have the piss man
nottheonion,not_removed,ah okay i was going to be really impressed neat shirt though
nottheonion,not_removed,dont you hate when that happens
nottheonion,not_removed,arent we just mr helpful
nottheonion,not_removed,well yes theres that potentially
nottheonion,not_removed,its probably made up youve got me on the indecent exposure youve got me on copyright if she took the pics he was yanking it to the story never says he sent her anything or that she asked him to stop anything though
nottheonion,not_removed,most places in the us anyway that would actually be battery offensive touching
nottheonion,not_removed,id say were in a gray area in this specific instance of arm grabbing what if i grabbed my friends arm as were crossing the street to stop him from stepping out in front of a bus is that assault technically yes but will a judge put me in jail for it i doubt it in the guys story he never says the dude sent her the videos also for it to be harassment the girl had to have requested that the guy stop doing it and the person in the pictures printed out is irrelevant if someone sends you anything and you ask them to stop and they continue its harassment
nottheonion,not_removed,no its the necessary byproduct of a nation of laws we cannot say something is morally reprehensible and therefore must be illegal otherwise who is to stop anyone from declaring anything obviously illegal therefore if it doesnt actually break the law as written then it cant be treated as an illegal act there are many things the person could have been doing that we simply havent heard about that would necessitate such a response but they werent in the story
nottheonion,not_removed,i believe it was a joke
nottheonion,not_removed,poetic really
nottheonion,not_removed,by what they actually do having the demeanor of a murderer should not be used as evidence of murder
nottheonion,not_removed,im about an hour and minutes away from jonesboro near little rock it just seems that jonesboro is nothing but banks churches and fast food nothing special about it little rock is minutes away from my hometown so ive always been accustomed to that legit business skyscraper type settingfeeling in little rock if that makes sense i pretty much got a full ride to astate hence the reason why i went but i am there to get my degree and get the heck out of dodge haha
nottheonion,not_removed,not too strange its that way due to being named after a native tribe by french explorers same idea behind pronouncing quebecois theres also ton of native influence here ouachita solgohacia caddo and the toltec mounds to name a few places and theres petit jean right in the dead center of the state ive literally never heard anyone say arkansawyer
nottheonion,not_removed,ole tom arkansawyer and his buddy huck finnessee
nottheonion,not_removed,haha ok
nottheonion,not_removed,i live a few miles outside fayetteville definitely not a bad gig
nottheonion,not_removed,word of advice even if you dont have kids look at the public schools if the schools arent good the town will probably suck too not sure if this applies to everywhere but it has been my experience living here
nottheonion,not_removed,you mean duck face
nottheonion,not_removed,unicorns can be creeps too
nottheonion,not_removed,if only there was a police force made up of mythical horned equestrians though im sure they wouldnt be tempted by lurid video
nottheonion,not_removed,i totally agree ive met enough of them to know they arent above being human
nottheonion,not_removed,the guy gets to see it all day everyday yet still videos it
nottheonion,not_removed,shit thats my hometown
nottheonion,not_removed,me too thanks
nottheonion,not_removed,well i likewise find it difficult to read texts with paragraphs thank space someone fixed the text for us
nottheonion,not_removed,due to cyber bullying cyberharassment has become a pretty common addition to harassment laws each state has differing definitions of what constitutes harassment but the whole they have to tell you to stop is mostly bullshit search your state harassment definition and look for a government sanctioned law archive majority of states have them now
nottheonion,not_removed,mmmh i disagree what if i sent you a dead animal head do i have to ask you to stop for it to be harrasment definetly not and if you grabbed my arm ado crossed the street yes thats assault whether you will get a da to press charges is another issue
nottheonion,not_removed,reddit will elect trump
nottheonion,not_removed,im in conway for school uca baby and loving it im from colorado and had no choice but to move here when i was young so i really dont like it here at all but conway is one of the better cities ive been in in ar that and hot springs
nottheonion,not_removed,dont blame you at all wish i could move away
nottheonion,not_removed,youll have to excuse him hes memetose intolerant
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks for the advice im moving to fayetteville or springdale any worries there
nottheonion,not_removed,if everywhere you go theres racist white trash maybe its you
nottheonion,not_removed,who you callin fuck face fuck face
nottheonion,not_removed,they do have dildos on their heads
nottheonion,not_removed,swans can be gay
nottheonion,not_removed,i dunno man unicorns are according to myth only attracted to virgins gotta be something freaky going on there
nottheonion,not_removed,sorry to hear that
nottheonion,not_removed,i disagree why do the requirements for harassment change because the object being sent is a horse head as long as a horse head is not otherwise illegal to send then you still need to request the sender stop before it can become harassment sounds like were in agreement on the second point
nottheonion,not_removed,ive lived in both conway and hot springs i miss both so much conway was more fun to live in for me but their both great
nottheonion,not_removed,have you been to fayetteville
nottheonion,not_removed,fayetteville is by far the better town but springdale isnt bad by any means depending on where in the town obviously springdale has the better mexican food though
nottheonion,not_removed,everyone is a fuck facefuck face broh
nottheonion,not_removed,conway is great because im close to all the people i know and can spontaneously go places and hang out basically whenever i want ive been living in maumelle for years with my parents and it sucks because its such a crappy place theres absolutely nothing to do and nobody to hang out with for me
nottheonion,not_removed,no actually but i want to visit soon im actually going up to rogers this week for a concert so ill be around that area i might check it out
nottheonion,not_removed,well im more likely moving to fayetteville but i had no idea about the mexican food in springdale ive spent some time in fayetteville and absolutely love it there it reminds me of home and the ozarks are beautiful
nottheonion,not_removed,ok just so long as its all clear thanks for the knowledge
nottheonion,not_removed,so ive heard i guess it being close to little rock is a plus though but you also have constant traffic on the highway
nottheonion,not_removed,definitely a beautiful area and theres some great hiking nearby ive grown to love fayetteville hope you do too
nottheonion,not_removed,the usa will take ivan drago nickoli volkov and mil in bitcoin
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,bitch ass contractor wandered into the wrong hood play time is over get your ass back to the suburbs motherfucker

nottheonion,not_removed,i sure hope he has a nephew who doesnt like him
nottheonion,not_removed,does he also have aspirations for conquering austria
nottheonion,not_removed,he seems to have the historical awareness of an earthworm
nottheonion,not_removed,i get that hes crazy and wants to kill a bunch of people but why even go after the addicts arent they the victims shouldnt he be going after the dealerssmugglersgrowerscookers
nottheonion,not_removed,people are calling this guy the filipino donald trump trump is nowhere near as dangerous or terrifying as this guy
nottheonion,not_removed,deleted
nottheonion,not_removed,well i applaud him for originality i never thought id see a leader actually compare themselves to hitlerhe really subverted expectations there
nottheonion,not_removed,somebody wake up reagan weve got a mission
nottheonion,not_removed,holy fuck will somebody assassinate this man please
nottheonion,not_removed,you know what would solve this unholy gross deplorable problem mass murder he should compare himself to a cunt
nottheonion,not_removed,canada is taking a lot of migrants and refugees from the philippinesi myself have new philippine pepole in my school
nottheonion,not_removed,how could fuckin philipino elect this dumb ass
nottheonion,not_removed,west media duterte likens himself to hitler west reaction see i told you this guy is the worst he likens himself to hitler west this guy is the second coming of satan real context duterte likens himself to hitler for criminals
nottheonion,not_removed,itt people who dont understand sarcasmtoo lazy to fact check
nottheonion,not_removed,its so weird all inphilippine people are against him and talk shits about him but almost philippine people support him all media exaggerate the number of people hes gonna kill and downplay the fact those are criminals and drug dealers
nottheonion,not_removed,and this is where i draw the line killing drug dealers fine theyre a scourge but drug addicts deserve treatment not a bullet
nottheonion,not_removed,in reddit or in internet in genera we have a joke about people correcting grammars and spelling and call them gramar nazi and its ok or in nba threads calling james harden as litterally hitler but when president duterte used the term hitler the west media go gaga just to portray him as the next hitler or satan incarnation of himself as a filipino i know that the president exaggerates himself quite often but when he likens himself to hitler he is addressing as the hitler of criminals same usage as to what the internet use nazi or hitler yeah he is hitler but what he meant is he will be the hitler of the criminals i mean how cant the west and its media misunderstood that
nottheonion,not_removed,oh im sure he has more than a nephew
nottheonion,not_removed,and before you know it hes invading poland already
nottheonion,not_removed,hitler never conquered austria it was consentually annexed
nottheonion,not_removed,conquering austria implying it wasnt like most of them cheered him as a son of their country
nottheonion,not_removed,not really he knows what hes doing the west wont interfere and honestly asian countries were not very aware of western wwii happenings its not at all ingrained in their culture nobody will do anything about this its on everyone that voted him in
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a very recent and western concept russia and asian nations dont see addicts as anything but leeches
nottheonion,not_removed,i think the main drug problem in the philippines is meth meth tweakers are victims first but then they become perpetrators of lots of crimes it is pretty easy to hate them if youve been around them it is a strange phenomenon though every dictator needs to blame the nations problems on an enemy dictators need war but in this case they are making war on regular peoples children and cousins
nottheonion,not_removed,well because theyre an identifiable group that people are somewhat predisposed to vilify already with little power or chance of being able to defend themselves and little chance of inspiring widespread sympathy so they can basically serve as an ideal scapegoat for all of societies problems so that then the new regime can be urgently united and consolidated by acting against the perceived threat regardless of whether these people have actually done anything so that paramilitary groups or roaming thugs under the control of the leader are considered legitimised and can then act not just against drug addicts but against dissidents of any kind you know thats how this works right
nottheonion,not_removed,yet
nottheonion,not_removed,trying pretty sure hes miles beyond that point
nottheonion,not_removed,macarthur
nottheonion,not_removed,that wont help the people voted him in because of his radical ideas someone would just replace him ironically the same is happening with the dealers when they are killed they are instantly replaced by someone who wants to make money its a viscous cycle
nottheonion,not_removed,i would fucking love that what i would love more is if he had a sondaughternephewniece who takes drugs and got caught
nottheonion,not_removed,omg yes please
nottheonion,not_removed,only of the voting population voted for the guy sadly he won through a campaign of hate
nottheonion,not_removed,coz we know our country better than you guys do we dont overreact to his statements coz we know the context of it and we understand his statements and the contexts around it example on this statement he is referring to being the hitler of the criminals and were pretty sure its an exageration he is just planting fear on the criminals and its working look at you youre scared to your balls i know its pretty hard to understand for low iq countries such as the yours we know who this guy is for decades we know what his capable of the media is trying to portray that his rise started from the election wrong it was the people who clamor for him to run for presidency he decided to retire in politics and people wanted him to run for president west portrayal of him is totally different to what he is in our country in summary we are not as dumb as the west look you cant even spell filipino right i mean do you even know were the philippines is located in the map or do you even know why the country is spelled with ph and filipinos with f
nottheonion,not_removed,implying youre going to have death camps is pretty shitty bro
nottheonion,not_removed,real context duterte likens himself to hitler for criminals is this supposed to be better because its not
nottheonion,not_removed,under rated post
nottheonion,not_removed,those are criminals and drug dealers you mean most of them are suspected drug pushers alleged drug dealers drug addicts or worse just collateral damage not to mention the extrajudicial killings
nottheonion,not_removed,the criminals being anyone he wants eventually which is exactly what hitler actually did
nottheonion,not_removed,httpmimgurcomgalleryjdsjnsr
nottheonion,not_removed,consensually
nottheonion,not_removed,sort of consensually kind of like crimea a decent sized majority supported annexation but the way it came about was still very shady
nottheonion,not_removed,if he knows what hes doing how come his spokespersons would try to make up excuses for things he says every now and then
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a widespread concept amongst the general public of most places to be honest you still get criminal convictions for possession of illegal drugs after all
nottheonion,not_removed,every populist dictator created an internal enemy to slowly remove rights from his own people for the common good and then created an external enemy us the commies to blame them for whatever he cant blame on his own policies
nottheonion,not_removed,most of these people need help not to be killed any civilised country tries to help them become productive members of society
nottheonion,not_removed,first he wants to build a border wall then he wants to kill millions its a slippery slope
nottheonion,not_removed,we have so much to look forward too imma go get some popcorn and head back to the bunker
nottheonion,not_removed,httppoliticscomphdutertessonpaolonamedasdavaossmugglingking
nottheonion,not_removed,he won not thru his campaign he won coz people know him decades before the election real adult filipino knows this millenials dont as they focus more on dota and what not
nottheonion,not_removed,bro you are spelling because as coz
nottheonion,not_removed,thaaaats why the spellcheck wasnt fixing it
nottheonion,not_removed,except it was a whole internationally recognized country rather than a small separatist nation that formed nearly entirely for the purpose of being annexed
nottheonion,not_removed,the same reason trumps do it inflame misdirection downplay repeat no publicity is bad publicity
nottheonion,not_removed,trump absolutely seems like the kind of guy who would have no problem throwing away the lives of a few hundred thousand american troops in order to satisfy his own ego
nottheonion,not_removed,you know whats going to happen right shits going to go down ill get to the bunker lock it up tight and then realize i bought decaf fffffffuuuuuuuuuu
nottheonion,not_removed,i blame the jews
nottheonion,not_removed,in countries where drugs are regulated many do become better learn trades and move on to live happier lives calling it spreading a disease is laughable people dont get into drugs because theyre infected they do it because they need an escape from a society that has marginalised them alcoholism is a similar example should we start killing all the drunks they get in cars and kill themselves and others they get violent and hit their spouses or other people they develop in some cases illnesses that cost the families a terrible debt we can pretend people who do drugs are bad but that is not true misguided lost helpless troubled yes a disease no
nottheonion,not_removed,not really though like at all
nottheonion,not_removed,whats up with your strawman arguments ive stated twice i dont agree they should be killed as far as disease intravenous drug users have an exceptionally high level of disease transmission i wasnt calling drug addicts themselves a disease but you know that youd just prefer to debate points which havent been posited either that or you really are as thick as you sound
nottheonion,not_removed,yes really and by the way with iran when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures that our people that they shouldnt be allowed to make they will be shot out of the water
nottheonion,not_removed,it certainly seemed like you did in any case shabu the principal drug consumed in the areas being most afflicted by this situation is smoked which means that there is no chance for the type of transmission youre talking about and once again although iv drug users can indeed transmit some diseases through sharing needles if they have them in the first place the reason rehab centers work is also because they provide their patients with clean needles which are incredibly cheap and prevent the transmission of disease by rehab centers for substance abuse have a fairly high success rate
nottheonion,not_removed,how is that at all related iran cant do shit
nottheonion,not_removed,trump absolutely seems like the kind of guy who would have no problem throwing away the lives of a few hundred thousand american troops in order to satisfy his own ego the point he was making was related to trumps ego seems related to me
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont see the issue with this theyre raising money to help and raffling off the most popular rifle in the united states to gain attraction
nottheonion,not_removed,why is this funny it could raise up to grand and it isnt what the shooter used
nottheonion,not_removed,this and variations of it have been posted like times on this sub now maybe its oniony but its not uncommon the philosophy here is that if those folks had guns theyd be able to fight back its not down out of callousness its just a different mindset
nottheonion,not_removed,fucking hilarious if some muslim looking dude won
nottheonion,not_removed,effin gun nuts absolutely certain the only way to put out the fire is to through enough kerosene on it
nottheonion,not_removed,not oniony
nottheonion,not_removed,nice thought but bad idea
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,except in this case you cant have a firearm in a place that gets more than of its revenue from alcohol which presumably the nightclub does im not disputing your comment just adding to it
nottheonion,not_removed,a gay muslim
nottheonion,not_removed,no idea why you are being downvoted you summarised the situation perfectly
nottheonion,not_removed,how i dont quite understand what youre trying to say
nottheonion,not_removed,is that just a florida law or is that nation wide
nottheonion,not_removed,hes suggesting that they are contributing to the problem that they are raising money for by distributing more weapons its particularly ironic or not i guess that this is the same type of gun used in the assault edit apparently not dont know how to strikethrough on mobile
nottheonion,not_removed,it depends on state but a lot have the rule or variations of it
nottheonion,not_removed,you know what im not sure i assumed it would be everywhere since its pretty sensible guns and drinking bad i just got my license to carry in texas and that was part of the curriculum
nottheonion,not_removed,the gun used was a sig sauer mcx edit fucked up the letters
nottheonion,not_removed,thank you for the explanation i wasnt quite sure what he was getting at but you made that clear
nottheonion,not_removed,i think is just because people assume that others outside their circle of interest know things that are common sense in that circle just as a scientist might assume the avarage citizen knows basic physics
nottheonion,not_removed,it was a sig sauer mcx the xcr is made by robinson armament and was not the make and model used
nottheonion,not_removed,i always get a reply on a gun comment
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks buddy edited
nottheonion,not_removed,because you know a five year old girl is gonna go rambo on her classmates with a stick that barely resembles a gun hell find me one stick formed completely by nature that looks like an or a and i dont want no crazy how nature do dat on a branch carved to look like the above firearms

nottheonion,not_removed,the holes are just the right size to keep the bad thoughts out but let the good thoughts in
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean pastafarians dont really take it seriously its the epitome of a joke religion
nottheonion,not_removed,well not the literal spaghetti monster afaik but many do take seriously what it stands for actively opposing the ridiculous parts of religion religious intrusion into public policy displays also highlighting hypocrisy when govts favor some religions over others when all religions are ultimately just based on personal belief
nottheonion,not_removed,lol amazon is advertising a hatchet on the same page
nottheonion,not_removed,she was really set on giving him an axe wound
nottheonion,not_removed,howtf is this not a sex crime i mean good jesus if the shoe was on the other footfucking christ
nottheonion,not_removed,feral viking id hit it
nottheonion,not_removed,is she hot any diseases i know plenty of guys who are in for a penny
nottheonion,not_removed,also an ad for venus razors maybe if shes been smoother he wouldve said yes
nottheonion,not_removed,just the way society is ive seen women in clubs literally walk around grabbing crotches and everyone just laughs it off flip the genders and theyd get the shit beat out of them and thrown in jail its nearly impossible to get charged with a sex crime as a woman most women dont even think they can sexually assault someone i once saw some girl try to kiss some guy and he pushed her away and she called him gay and he said something about assault and she literally said i cant assault you im a woman you can even see it in this thread people making jokes about it and stuff imagine an article where a man tried to attack a woman with an axe over sex the entire tone would be different you can also see it in domestic violence articles for example ive seen stories where women tried to cut their boyfriends dicks off and half the comments are puns and jokes
nottheonion,not_removed,double standards
nottheonion,not_removed,welcome to modern gender equality think there will be any outrage like there was with brock turner ironically if he did agree to have sex with her feminists would call him the rapist because she was drunk
nottheonion,not_removed,bullshit headline it was allegedly men on her property with atleast one rifle
nottheonion,not_removed,thought it was a trickortreater based on headline i dont blame her at all thats just messed up
nottheonion,not_removed,can someone explain to me how this is even on this sub theres nothing oniony about this
nottheonion,not_removed,warning shot i would have shot at him article says he pointed his gun at her i think that escalates past a warning shot maybe im wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,wow this sounds like she had every right to shoot this asshole he was on her private property and at her door with a facial concealment and a gun telling her to let him in plus bad two others in her yard and when she went out he tried to load his gun and aim it at her then he wouldnt drop the gun when she told him to i would have shot to kill
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont see how this is in nottheonion do the moderators even read the story anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,trespassing pointing a rifle i would have made that clown holy and sent him to jesus
nottheonion,not_removed,so basically a robberyhome invasion attempt possibly inspired by all these idiots dressing as clowns and shitty reporting trying to capitalize on said inspiration because apparently the true headline as frightening as it is might not be as popular wow
nottheonion,not_removed,warning shots arent legal generally speaking shooting to maim is also not legal if deadly force is justified you shoot them if they have a gun they arent dropping you shoot them twice and i like the map they provide to her house
nottheonion,not_removed,why is this in rnottheonion first off the title completely misrepresents the actual article secondly even the clickbaity title doesnt represent the point of rnottheonion because it doesnt even sound like something the onion would publish this sub needs to get its act together
nottheonion,not_removed,lol they put a google maps link to the victims address i can streetview and play by play the article
nottheonion,not_removed,woman fires warning shot at armed robbers invading her home the mask is almost totally irrelevant
nottheonion,not_removed,dayton woman fires warning shot at armed men that were pointing a rifle at her and trying to load it nothing oniony about this at all
nottheonion,not_removed,why the fuck did they link a google location pin to their address im honestly curious as to why the people would be happy about them making their address literally being clicks away to anyone who wanted it the person who wrote this really needs to think about titles and content
nottheonion,not_removed,this reminds me of something that happened a few days ago here there was a man in my neighbourhood who dressed up like a clown and was terrorizing women on the street one night the police were patrolling around my building never did find out if they caught the guy
nottheonion,not_removed,with all the shit going down with people dressing up like clowns and terrorizing people plus the fact that virtually no one likes clowns and while i wouldnt nornally subscribe to this notion youre pretty much asking to get shot looking like one
nottheonion,not_removed,why is this on not the onion when this is something probably all of us would have done
nottheonion,not_removed,this woman is bad ass if someone came on my property with a clown mask and tried getting in id do the same thing
nottheonion,not_removed,this is why owning guns for protection is good criminals and the mal intended will always have some way of getting them
nottheonion,not_removed,she should have shot them dead she is lucky she was not killed
nottheonion,not_removed,dont act dumb get on your knees and oh shit you have a gun nevermind get back to the van the heist is over
nottheonion,not_removed,im pretty liberal but i think this gave me a amendment boner glad she had protection ha ha boner protection
nottheonion,not_removed,when she turned around there was a male at the back door with an unknown long rifle according to a dayton police report the man was telling the woman to open the back door that was locked at the time id say the shot was justified
nottheonion,not_removed,redditors never fire a warning shot if you have to fire your weapon your life is in danger and you should be firing to stop the threat
nottheonion,not_removed,heres a woman who knows how hard it is to get dead clown off your driveway
nottheonion,not_removed,turns out the musket was a poor choice for home invasions
nottheonion,not_removed,the most press daytons gotten since the wright brothers
nottheonion,not_removed,we shouldnt ignore the fact that they should be dead for the bullshit theyre trying to pull bringing a rifle to someones back door demanding entry with two people in the front yard to cut off any sort of retreatwtf is that fuck them
nottheonion,not_removed,dont do meth around halloween youll have some bizarre hallucinations and fire warning shots into your garage
nottheonion,not_removed,it was made to sound like warning shots were fired at some random guy walking down the street with a clown mask on
nottheonion,not_removed,is no one else perturbed that they not only put the ladies address in the article but included a link to fucking google maps as well
nottheonion,not_removed,texan here why would anyone ever fire a warning shot everybody gets one before they get seconds every time
nottheonion,not_removed,never fire warning shots if its time to shoot its time to shoot to stop a threat shoot center of mass
nottheonion,not_removed,why waste a warning shot
nottheonion,not_removed,after reading the article in her position i would have been aiming for the man and not my garage jesus christ
nottheonion,not_removed,why did she fire into her garage
nottheonion,not_removed,work about half a mile from where this happened can confirm this area is shit
nottheonion,not_removed,holy shit mad props for the woman she handled it like a champ and didnt shoot him right away
nottheonion,not_removed,warning shot is more than i wouldve given in her situation misleading title
nottheonion,not_removed,if you go as a clown this year you are a fucking idiot
nottheonion,not_removed,sadly the gun simply said bang
nottheonion,not_removed,why exactly was black revolver handgun in quotes
nottheonion,not_removed,the title is extremely misleading
nottheonion,not_removed,why the fuck did she start with a warning shot
nottheonion,not_removed,with all of the stuff going on in the headlines this title can seem to be kinda misleading
nottheonion,not_removed,says shes a fucking liar
nottheonion,not_removed,more like shitty news stations playing up clown attacks when they have done nothing at all but scare people which makes it worse because more idiots want to doit because the news keeps playing it up people are stupid to even get riledup over it and people doing it are stupid to do it where people have guns stupid plus scared is gonna end up with a dead year old doing a prank because people think the stupid kids are out to steal and murder their children but the news people will get out with no blame for stirring the pot on a non story because they dont have a hurricane or snow storm to talk about
nottheonion,not_removed,begun the clown wars have
nottheonion,not_removed,clown lives matter
nottheonion,not_removed,no warning shots should have killed the guy standing at her door with a rifle
nottheonion,not_removed,i was gonna be a clown for halloween but i live in the south so the odds of me getting shot are about im just gonna be dr strange instead i guess
nottheonion,not_removed,warning shots gets your ass in jail or sued say it with me i feared for my life i feared for my life i feared for my life
nottheonion,not_removed,when being attacked by a mob of clowns go for the juggler
nottheonion,not_removed,alright maybe its just how i am reading this but does it seem like theyre being judgmental pricks for her firing a warning shot in defense of herself against an armed individual not that i dont find fault in the warning shot no one is getting a warning shot from me if they try to break into my place then point a gun in my direction
nottheonion,not_removed,this is just a run of the mill home invasion that would be unnewsworthy without the clown mask
nottheonion,not_removed,headline is bullshit it wouldnt have been a warning shot from me if someones pointing a gun at me and is loading it im going to assume theyre planning to shoot me
nottheonion,not_removed,not far from where i went to high school glad i got out of there and moved to the nicer part of town
nottheonion,not_removed,ohio has castle law she had the right to protect herself and family with deadly force in this specific scenario
nottheonion,not_removed,could have fired that warning shot at them should have actually
nottheonion,not_removed,is this even real i feel like the reporters are doubting everything she says with the quotations this is bizarre
nottheonion,not_removed,guy wearing clown mask they forgot the minuet detail that hes holding a rifle there are of them and all on her property
nottheonion,not_removed,never fire warning shots the only way you should ever shoot is into the badguy
nottheonion,not_removed,am i the only one who thinks this whole clown thing is just an elaborate viral campaign to drum up hype for the it remake
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess its a good thing that emmett kelly didnt live to see this
nottheonion,not_removed,good for her
nottheonion,not_removed,just as an important note dont fire warning shots if the situation has escalated to the point where you feel you will only be safe if you discharge your firearm you shoot to kill you never know where a warning shot might go or what it might ricochet off of and it might potentially harmful someone you never intended to harm
nottheonion,not_removed,hey something happened where i live
nottheonion,not_removed,the clown wars have begun
nottheonion,not_removed,real life horror movie shit
nottheonion,not_removed,she should have shot him
nottheonion,not_removed,screw the warning shot idea on my property pointing a gun at me kiss your hind end good bye
nottheonion,not_removed,i said across her nose not up it
nottheonion,not_removed,wrong move mam you should have just shot the fucker drt its completely his fault he came to a gunfight with an unloaded gun
nottheonion,not_removed,so i live miles away from a town called dayton scared the shit out of me thank goodness its not the same one
nottheonion,not_removed,thats when she grabbed her black revolver handgun according to the police report why would you describe a guns color instead of its caliber i have mad respect for this womans attitude not only did she hold it together as men were outside her house trying to get in but she had the balls to step out front and make those clowns into her bitches they wont be coming back to bother her the last thing a criminal wants to face is a person who has a gun and knows how to use it theyll go somewhere else and terrorize some defenseless liberals
nottheonion,not_removed,those dudes could have all been wearing mr rogers masks the issue here wasnt the masks the issue was these were three dudes possibly attempting a home invasion
nottheonion,not_removed,in virginia its one shot one kill as long as theyre in your home not sure about property
nottheonion,not_removed,i would not be firing a warning shot if some one had a gun on my property with intent to use those fuckers would be dead
nottheonion,not_removed,rfloridaman
nottheonion,not_removed,uh she was being robbed
nottheonion,not_removed,i wouldnt have let them to off so easy if you show up at my house with a clown mask and a gun its you or me
nottheonion,not_removed,good for her she is covering up for poor marksmanship well
nottheonion,not_removed,terrorism and attemtped murder is a prank now this world has gone to madness
nottheonion,not_removed,that story was written by a year old
nottheonion,not_removed,because the clown mask is a reoccurrence of activity back in the its a crime that occurred with some guy running around in a clown mask hacking at women and children there are people from london who are coming over to the united states are stationed in certain places and are causing a mess while pretending to be innocent while the masses just sit back and watch like trained zombies i am telling you you dont know how many times reddit has been used in disgusting ways known to mankind its an awful little place and the whole point is a bunch of angry mygonist creeps to keep having control while attempting to call themselves kicking women and men out these crappy rituals some stupid eat people crap i mean what the fuck is going on here the more morbid something looks it doesnt make me want to buy it it actually makes me want to go around to the other side and not buy it some of us work in positions where we have to deal with this type of thing irl and it is not pleasurable to see it done no i dont want this as an example this shit is demonic evil and disgusting anyone who enjoys this something is more than wrong with your head your possessed with something and you need some jesus in your life and these fetishesa guy wanting to eat someone else the fuck is going onsome people cooking their babies platenra like its good food and its all garbage seriously we got some very sick people in here who like hiding behind the and amendment so they can commit crimes in their homes now without anyone knowing then they creep out in the people commit a few crimes then run back to the homebase omg this world is insane and the nutties are being thrown on the internet why do i want to be surrounded by people with psycho problems on the internet i had to turn off the the television yet at the same time i have to watch the news no i will not be watching mainstream television anymore i am tired of the older generations nagging about it women can be vicious as nasty as hell too these are scorpion women and deserve to have their butts kicked hard in the buttocks then they sit and taunt you to hit them on the other hand you obviously have guys that come from very terrible terrible circumstances and what does society do kick dirt in their faces thats what then the little nasty cia branch no one fucking likes that branch that branch sucks balls and is full of jackasses and assholes they want to make it their little cool darpa and ganko club i mean what the hell do we have year olds with guns running the cia
nottheonion,not_removed,screw warning shots im not messing around with clowns
nottheonion,not_removed,im not from the us but would she have been justified in just shooting the guy like did she have to fire a warning shot or could she have just slugged him
nottheonion,not_removed,this story should be less about the clown mask and more about the rifle the guy was holding while demanding entry
nottheonion,not_removed,bullets are their only weakness
nottheonion,not_removed,ayyy dayton on frontpage and it isnt for heroine lets go
nottheonion,not_removed,surprised it started in dayton of all places
nottheonion,not_removed,my hometown dayton making the front page go ohio
nottheonion,not_removed,dayton woman fires warning shot at potential home invaders what a fucking clickbait
nottheonion,not_removed,never fire a warning shot your first shot should be at center mass a warning shot gives the aggressor time to endanger you further
nottheonion,not_removed,this story stinks like the millbury mass story
nottheonion,not_removed,god damn it dayton why do you have to be the news like this
nottheonion,not_removed,how did the clown thing became a thing again
nottheonion,not_removed,my warning shot would of been the only shot right between the eyes
nottheonion,not_removed,economy must be bad the payday gang are trying to knock over homes now come on bain get some real jobs lined up and get us some real drills for fucks sake
nottheonion,not_removed,bad title op fix it misleading
nottheonion,not_removed,headline bs aside it dawned on me today that killers clowns are the most irational fear out there they wear giant baggy colorful cloths and shoes both probably make a tone of noise when in motion and slow them down they have only been seen only on wide open college campuses i doubt they could catch anyone
nottheonion,not_removed,if she had called the cops and sheltered in place we could see if it was real a week from now when someone calls about an odor from the house rip garage
nottheonion,not_removed,misleading title
nottheonion,not_removed,look at the piece of shit article at the related section near the bottom some year old cop trying to fight two year old kids who had clown masks on what is with all of this clown shit
nottheonion,not_removed,what happened to the guy in the i think clownsuit who was trespassing in a house and got shot by guy i think the shooter was the owner of the house and even warned the trespasser before shooting this was uploaded on reddit few weeks ago
nottheonion,not_removed,why bother with the warning shot this man didnt deserve a warning shot
nottheonion,not_removed,guys i live in springfield ohio and watch wdtn news my safety is fucked if this is true will someone plz save me
nottheonion,not_removed,at this point i dont understand why anyone would want to dress up as a clown
nottheonion,not_removed,if the title is misleading then why do you assholes keep upvoting it
nottheonion,not_removed,all of this is seemed believable to me until he started loading the rifle who shows up to a place with a gun not loaded but brings the ammo to load it there after starting the altercation did he just put it off until the last minute was a just in case type thing did he think loading it in front of someone would be more intimidating like when someone pulls back the hammer in movies
nottheonion,not_removed,who is florida women for
nottheonion,not_removed,wow that is terrifying
nottheonion,not_removed,who the fuck tries to go up to some womans home brings a rifle then when confronted at that point is when you decide its a good idea to load it whole story reeks
nottheonion,not_removed,im glad the media has whipped the public into hysteria about this
nottheonion,not_removed,all black revolver handguns matter
nottheonion,not_removed,always remember redditors using a firearm is a use of deadly force not shooting to kill will land you in legal trouble only use guns if you think you are in mortal danger and if your are in mortal danger you should be shooting to kill anyway legally the court will assume you werent in mortal danger if you were firing warning shots just be honest and say you missed your first shots if your that bad of a marksmen nobody will blame you
nottheonion,not_removed,begun the clown wars have
nottheonion,not_removed,why didnt she shoot him and call the cops that way there wouldve been a chance that guy wouldve ratted the other out and theyd all be in jail
nottheonion,not_removed,im all or banning weapons all together but this is imo one of the only things a handgun could and should be used for
nottheonion,not_removed,what im wondering is why he decided to load the rifle when he did
nottheonion,not_removed,you looked at the bullshit headline and thought this would be a great post for rnottheonion if youd read the article youd know theres nothing oniony about this and this woman had an awful experience and had every right to fire a warning shot
nottheonion,not_removed,did she get arrested for discharging a firearm i remember reading an article about a woman who fired a warning shot at her abusive boyfriend and she got like years in prison for it
nottheonion,not_removed,i actually live in this area and there have been multiple clown sightings like this that ended up shutting down schools and what not and theyve l turned out to be false and made up it makes it hard to trust any of these coming out now
nottheonion,not_removed,let us all take a moment and realize how much a badass this women is she runs from the man with a rifle grabs her own gun and runs outside
nottheonion,not_removed,warning shots are bad form if you pull out a gun bullets should be going into people
nottheonion,not_removed,how does something like this happen in the first place how fucked up do you have to be to take a rifle and a clown mask to scare people if this is the level were at right now i doubt we will make it another years assuming the guy was trying to scare her which is according to the news some kind of fucked up trend
nottheonion,not_removed,right next to the mad river whatd they expect
nottheonion,not_removed,of course its bullshit nobody fires warning shots nobody is going outside their home putting themselves in danger when she knows already that the guy previously at the back door was armed its an attention grabber
nottheonion,not_removed,i have little faith for the future of humanity
nottheonion,not_removed,i think that it should be legal to shoot clowns im not sure how quickly they reproduce so maybe keep it to a bag limit of per season but we obviously need to reduce their numbers
nottheonion,not_removed,i would have put him down
nottheonion,not_removed,she should of shot him if he had a gun and then we could all know if it real if someone was at my back door with a gun trying to get in they would be shot on sight
nottheonion,not_removed,if the man with the rifle was intending to use it why didnt he have the rifle loaded before hand
nottheonion,not_removed,clowns are allergic to bullets
nottheonion,not_removed,wait whats the oniony part of this douchebags in clown masks have been being creepy all over the place this year these ones had guns and were giving her threatening commands so she fired a warning shot when they didnt put down the gun they had
nottheonion,not_removed,arent these supposed to be marked with misleading title
nottheonion,not_removed,they knew she wasnt kidding around
nottheonion,not_removed,sw ohio dont fuck around
nottheonion,not_removed,really thought this was gonna be about dayton texas
nottheonion,not_removed,from daytonsurrounding area can confirm we do shit like this usually the white folk though
nottheonion,not_removed,proud to call dayton my home town this is pretty normal deal with a lot of heroin addicts they do crazy shit
nottheonion,not_removed,both of them declared assholes sent to asylum for toddler minded people
nottheonion,not_removed,well considering some of these evil clown pranksters have caused damage to people and property i think its perfectly ok that she fire a warning shot to scare them off or keep them at bay halloween or not you cant trust anyone behind a mask least of all if its a grown man
nottheonion,not_removed,can we just call them juggalos clowns used to be nice
nottheonion,not_removed,oh man my hometown in all likelihood this whole story is completely fabricated my townsfolk have this obsession with overhyping this bull about clowns see it all the time with people posting scare tactic fear mongering crap in facebook i know theyre just looking for an excuse to act like they are hard asses in the face of this nonexistential threat not to mention all the news media in this area are also just foaming at the mouths for opportunities to report on this pretty much every news outlet from newspapers to new stations has fully embraced the extremely shitty practice of clickbait articles and shorts just for ratings its pathetic this article and story arent worth two seconds of your time sorry on behalf of all the decent people from and still in dayton oh
nottheonion,not_removed,did somebody say my name
nottheonion,not_removed,dayton reporting in perfect story to put us on the front page
nottheonion,not_removed,good for her
nottheonion,not_removed,i should write a click bait song
nottheonion,not_removed,guess ill have to find a better way to get my neighbor to cut his grassthanks all
nottheonion,not_removed,why does everyone think internet comments are so full of lies and then someone spins a convoluted unlikely tale like this and nobody even doubts it for a second if this was an internet comment wed be saying she probably got trigger happy around some teenagers and told the cops some bullshit so she wouldnt go to jail
nottheonion,not_removed,why the fuck is there a google map of where she lives
nottheonion,not_removed,clown lives matter
nottheonion,not_removed,i expect complete silence from antigun people regarding this event
nottheonion,not_removed,so a guy comes onto a ladys property with a gun wearing a freaky mask and its funny now that she tries to defend herself
nottheonion,not_removed,after reading this why the hell did she fire a warning shot she should have just unloaded on him also what kind of moron comes to robrapemurderor whatever and doesnt have their gun loaded
nottheonion,not_removed,this sounds more like a robbery about to happen with one of the men hiding his face with a clown mask not sure why the op tried to tie this into the clown craze rather than what it actually was shame on you op
nottheonion,not_removed,holy shit youre right read this article people shit is crazy edit i also just realised that theres no evidence this even happened apart from this ladys word
nottheonion,not_removed,seriously should be woman fires warning shot at man at her back door holding a long gun
nottheonion,not_removed,can we get the title tagged with something like false or clickbait
nottheonion,not_removed,yea this title is total crap woman fires warning shot at intruder trying to shoot her im not a gun nut but this is definitely textbook case of why proponents advise having a gun
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah i was expecting some teenager making a youtube video turns out it was some last house on the left shit
nottheonion,not_removed,it should read women shot at man pointing a gun at her
nottheonion,not_removed,and that gun probably saved her life but no gun rights are ruining america s
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah what the fuck wrong sub
nottheonion,not_removed,its a reddit headline no surprise
nottheonion,not_removed,if that is true then she shouldnt of fired a warning shot
nottheonion,not_removed,i would have unloaded onto those idiots she was very calm im really impressed
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty much this i would t have bothered with a warning shot i wouldve drilled them
nottheonion,not_removed,im surprised she fired a warning shot instead of just shooting the guy loading the rifle
nottheonion,not_removed,for the lazy the suspect with the clown mask ran into the yard thats when the woman exited her house and saw the suspect with the mask point the rifle at her and try to load his weapon
nottheonion,not_removed,who trick or treats days before halloween
nottheonion,not_removed,i reckon it was and she made up some bullshit to cover her panicked shot who the fuck would take a gun to do a home invasion and keep the bullets in their pocket
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought it was going to be that she overreacted to someone on the street wearing a costume but this was an attempted home invasion good on the woman for defending herself
nottheonion,not_removed,im just glad she was armed
nottheonion,not_removed,this was a home invasion not some sort of wacky slownewsday headline
nottheonion,not_removed,easythis sub blows now
nottheonion,not_removed,probably because of the headline which is false she fired a warning shot at her garage however it would be absurd and onioney to fire a warning shot at the suspect especially if only for wearing a clown mask
nottheonion,not_removed,because clowns current
nottheonion,not_removed,yea this is news nothing comical nothing comical nothing ironic nothing puzzling it belongs in rnews honestly for this to be on my front page with over votes is embarrassing this isnt mindblowingly ridiculous this is a allegedly potential home invasion with the possibility of a homicide
nottheonion,not_removed,there would have been a dead clown in my yard
nottheonion,not_removed,plot twist she just had terrible aim and didnt want to admit it
nottheonion,not_removed,where im from when i say i fired a warning shot it usually means i missed but want to sound like i meant to miss on purpose its like the time i had to lay my bike down into a controlled crash i did that on purpose because im a man
nottheonion,not_removed,in many states firing a warning shot is an automatic felony plus guns are life and death instruments by the time an aggressor is pointing a weapon at their target the time for warnings has long passed glad no one is dead here as an aside have all of these clowns worn gloves any reports on their race and or build are they athletic overweight white
nottheonion,not_removed,warning shots lead to investigations and stories with two sides never fire a warning shot
nottheonion,not_removed,its a warning shot if you miss
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree although a warning shot should never really be a consideration either shoot someone or dont
nottheonion,not_removed,she batmans doesnt wanna kill someone even though its justified very cool
nottheonion,not_removed,kudos to her i would have resorted to the golden rule in her scenario
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know the laws but in some states you can arrested for fire a warning shot
nottheonion,not_removed,the article said he was attempting to load his weapon not that he aimed it at her i keep a mossberg and i would have killed him right then in that situation with no warning of any kind however i would also not have opened my door in the first place i would have called and waited inside with the mossberg three men in a chokepoint is a shambles edit my error you were correct he aimed then attempted to load worth a load of double ought buck either way
nottheonion,not_removed,well legally speaking warning shots are a bad idea youre better off shooting to kill
nottheonion,not_removed,all shots are warning shots as long as you miss
nottheonion,not_removed,read that first time as shoot his asshole which i dont think would kill you but getting the lead out might be pretty easy
nottheonion,not_removed,apparently shes a better person than most of us here i dont get why people criticise her i mean i dont think id have any scruples killing someone pointing a gun at me but that doesnt change that she chose to spare a human life which is an intrinsically good thing
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean its technically not an onion article
nottheonion,not_removed,and as a side note research suggests you dont try to have a conversation you give short loud concise directions stop get down get down get down or drop it drop it drop it the adrenaline dump in both parties as part of fight or flight gives you tunnel hearing as well as tunnel vision
nottheonion,not_removed,i understand this and i understand the logic behind it however when youre confronted with this kind of situation with all the adrenaline and everything i would rather be charged with illegally discharging my firearm into my garage than charged with accidentally killing somebody when i missjudged the situation this reminds me of the story of the teenage girl who decided to surprise her dad with a prank she was supposed to be sleeping at a friends house but she decided to hide in the closet and was going to surprise him and scare him by jumping out of the closet he shot it with a shotgun and killed her
nottheonion,not_removed,depending on your state
nottheonion,not_removed,why is this its seems counter intuitive to make deadly force the only legal recourse edit deadly
nottheonion,not_removed,you can probably find him on youtube scaring people
nottheonion,not_removed,people are so fucking stupid all it takes is fucking with the wrong person one time and youre dead
nottheonion,not_removed,liberalism doesnt equal being anti gun
nottheonion,not_removed,my first shot is to center mass its warning that if you continue ill shoot you again
nottheonion,not_removed,smart man
nottheonion,not_removed,i think it started that way and then weirdos took it to another level
nottheonion,not_removed,exactly warning shots and shooting to wound can both get you jail time too if you dont have cause to shoot to stop you dont fire
nottheonion,not_removed,did it say it was a prank
nottheonion,not_removed,having actually read the article shed probably be in the clear under ohio law to just shoot him three masked and armed men demanding entry to your home pretty much defines selfdefense in most of the usa
nottheonion,not_removed,note i havent read the article only if someone is charging you with some sort of weapon with the intent to hurtkill tough judgement call sometimes will you be justified in killing them if they surrender right then and there or if they start running away shooting with the intent to murder isnt a great idea if they are running away and shooting back defend yourself and cap the fuckers i remember hearing a story of a few teens breaking into a house the owner even when they started fleeing kept shooting to kill got all of em and got a hefty jail sentence for murder warning shots not always the greatest idea if you aim into the air or near the person you are trying to scare off that stray bullet could hurtkill someone else
nottheonion,not_removed,httpimgurcomaxarxe
nottheonion,not_removed,ive wondered too possibly a bb gun but that wouldnt have stopped him from loading it before hand either way he was trying to intimidate her and theres no way to tell in the dark
nottheonion,not_removed,actually she is a dumbass from a legal standpoint the moment you persue someone your ass is grass because they are no longer a threat but yea took some balls on her part adrenaline is a motherfucker when it starts pumping
nottheonion,not_removed,im sure the clowns are welcome to go tell the police their version of events says they wont
nottheonion,not_removed,you know it like catch a predator but for clowns
nottheonion,not_removed,because a person being threatened by a firearm like this woman was absolutely has the right to defend herself and the anti gun people dont take issue with firearms being used in self defense
nottheonion,not_removed,law abiding gun owner has a weapon stashed in her living room and responsibly uses it to defend her property unless shes on the terrorist watch list then of antigun see no problem here nor do they want to change laws that would prevent this
nottheonion,not_removed,how about we have some standards so that people like the guy at the door either cant obtain a gun or have an identification system so that if they use it in a crime it can be tracked you fucking idiot
nottheonion,not_removed,if neither of them had guns would it have been more less or the same amount of dangerous
nottheonion,not_removed,agree the headline is bs the article is frightening and reads more like the plot to a terror movie
nottheonion,not_removed,great just what we need in life more psychopaths with affinity for creepy clown masks
nottheonion,not_removed,gorramit nancy shot her gun in the front yard again i told her it was illegal i did now imma call the cops on her ass maam we heard reports of shots fired from this address can you tell us what happened thinking fast clowns clowns with guns in my front yard genius nancy genius
nottheonion,not_removed,yup whole thing reeks of horse shit
nottheonion,not_removed,classic moral panic
nottheonion,not_removed,there seems to be some bizarre agenda against clowns lately especially since the first story that started this all wasnt even fucking accurate
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont believe her why would they have a rifle with them and the bullets separate
nottheonion,not_removed,yea itll only take like seconds
nottheonion,not_removed,everyone is turning into a drug head or a crackie their being released from the hildabeast swamps jeez and their running around doing all the dirty work while these asshats sit back and watch the free entertainment its digusting you even have old hags attempting to get young men so they can use them for their money then toss them to the side afterwards it doesnt make me want to go inside it makes me want to stay inside where its safe
nottheonion,not_removed,i tried to read the article i gave up because its impossible to expand the full text on mobile without being redirected to an ad
nottheonion,not_removed,hell the warning shot wasnt even at them she fired it into her garage
nottheonion,not_removed,thats shit lol
nottheonion,not_removed,it might also be the fact that news media is becoming less and less about the truth of a situation and more about what causes the most emotional reaction and thus generates more interest editwording
nottheonion,not_removed,or you know just remove it because its not even oniony
nottheonion,not_removed,how about just removing the post all a post like this is doing is sending clicks to a blatant clickbait article
nottheonion,not_removed,it should also be tagged not even oniony
nottheonion,not_removed,proponents also advise against warning shots
nottheonion,not_removed,gotta respect someone who doesnt want to murder even though its justified and has the means
nottheonion,not_removed,she may have shot at him and missed then retroactively called it a warning shot making that shot with a handgun under stress is rather difficult
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah if youre a gun owner and youre even going to consider firing a warning shot just give your gun away guns are not for intimidation theyre for self defense you should have already determined that your life is in imminent danger requiring deadly force as a response before you even consider drawing your weapon if you have time for a warning shot youve already accessed the situation incorrectly
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a felony discharge in florida too and most states you are only supposed to fire at the target and because you have to
nottheonion,not_removed,she accidentally fires gun in garage makes up clown story to cover it up
nottheonion,not_removed,there was a male at the back door with an unknown long rifle according to a dayton police report she said the man was wearing a clown mask a longsleeved black shirt black gloves and black jeans the man was telling the woman to open the back door that was locked at the time the victim ran into the living room where she was able to see two other men in her front yard thats when she grabbed her black revolver handgun according to the police report the suspect with the clown mask ran into the yard thats when the woman exited her house and saw the suspect with the mask point the rifle at her and try to load his weapon
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah if a guy is on my property and pointing a gun at me that guy is getting shot
nottheonion,not_removed,for those on mobile tired of batting away sketchy ads as well thanks
nottheonion,not_removed,links that get removed because theyre not oniony links that get to stay up because they are this fucking post
nottheonion,not_removed,bozo lay dead was shot in the head for my sent that kid to heaven
nottheonion,not_removed,there would have been three dead clowns in my yard ftfy
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty much all generic clown outfits are basically by design made to conceal just about everything gloves are pretty standard comically baggy clothes etc most clown outfits ive seen in well lit birthdaycarnivalcircus settings up fairly close and in good lighting one could expect a lb variability and uncertainty on height
nottheonion,not_removed,not to mention they are reckless hard to know where that bullet will go unless she fired it into the ground which could still ricochet
nottheonion,not_removed,warning shots give them a chance to return fire too
nottheonion,not_removed,yep every bullet should have an intended target
nottheonion,not_removed,fire a warning shot into his face
nottheonion,not_removed,but uncle joe said to
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know batman is kind of fucked up he may not kill but he cripples a lot which may be worse
nottheonion,not_removed,she just wants to fight with them until they get all tuckered out and go to sleep
nottheonion,not_removed,i gotta think him trespassing and pointing his weapon at her would be enough id certainly think an officer would have shot him for that
nottheonion,not_removed,i see it like this if she kills the guy she has very upset guys on her property that are already predisposed to doing bad things if she scares them away there is likely to be less personal repercussions
nottheonion,not_removed,i didnt like that it was my instinct but being a shorter lanky guy working at a homeless shelter i was always amazed at the instant response id get from the most full throated hey i could muster when things got out of control large men in the middle of adrenaline fueled fighting would stop cold and make eye contact with me next was like you said short loud commands you over here and you over there now were hard wired to pay attention to loud noises and people who act like they know better in a crisis i guess cause the ones that dont know better die before they can give others bad advice evolution ftw
nottheonion,not_removed,a solution would be to shoot in a safe direction near the target say into the dirt by their feet and simply claim you missed even if you fire a warning shot never admit to it say you were shooting to kill
nottheonion,not_removed,agreed also you dont have time to think about whats legal or not in these situations you do what you think is the correct thing to do to save your life and or others she obviously did not want to cause harm to any one and also did not want to lose her own life so she took the risk of a warning shot whether it was the wrong or right thing to do thats what she thought was correct at the time
nottheonion,not_removed,if the situation is bad enough that you have to use a firearm at all then its bad enough to end that persons life otherwise you dont need that level of force if you use unnecessary force then you are now the aggressor because you have escalated the situation by discharging a firearm without a fear of death or grave bodily harm edit downvoting me doesnt change the legal precedence edit the other way to say it is if youre not willing to neutralize the threat then the threat isnt high enough to fire your weapon
nottheonion,not_removed,guns are not warning devices if warning shots were preferred wed have people shooting a lot more than they are now with predictable consequences people would feel encouraged to escalate situations
nottheonion,not_removed,because discharging a firearm is the application of lethal force no matter what its targeting if youre in a situation such that you dont think you need to kill someone to save your life you shouldnt be discharging your firearm in the first place the other reason is that warning shots are still bullets and will keep flying until they impact something and shooting the floor is even worse because bullets can easily ricochet in unintended ways a good rule of thumb with a gun is not to aim or fire it unless youre okay with destroying your target everything in front of your target and everything behind your target
nottheonion,not_removed,you should not fire your weapon unless you believe your life is in immediate danger if your life is in immediate danger then you would not be firing warning shots
nottheonion,not_removed,because if you were able to fire a warning shot you didnt think your life was in imminent danger otherwise you would have simply shot the threat directly and thus lethal force wasnt justified basically a gun is only allowed to be used when a threat needs to die right fucking now does it need to die now obviously not because you were able to fire a warning shot thus you werent allowed to use your gun from a legal standpoint your gun is only drawn after youve already made the decision to kill the target
nottheonion,not_removed,oh i agree im actually quite progun even though i often vote democrat i just like to joke since the stereotypical liberal is seen as advocating for total gun bans and confiscations
nottheonion,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikimarissaalexandercase was husband not boyfriend
nottheonion,not_removed,i think the issue is that many antigun people would want laws in place preventing her from having the gun in the first place its not that they think she was unjustified its that they would have prevented her from having the ability to defend herself in the first place
nottheonion,not_removed,dont bring logic into this gun nuts dont use logic either you want everyone to have a gun or no one to have one
nottheonion,not_removed,right because if you are willing to rob and kill law abiding citizens you totally wont be willing to steal a fucking gun do you understand how foolish it is to think any law can wholly prevent premeditated crimes
nottheonion,not_removed,going after them after they have potentially killed someone yeah right and as if it isnt possible to illegally buy guns or steal them
nottheonion,not_removed,probably would have been more dangerous since its men on one female at that point
nottheonion,not_removed,im fairly sure that people who arent afraid to shoot others will happily get a gun illegally i know where people go to get most things in my town as far as narcotics are concerned im sure i could get a gun if i wanted to not that theres any reason to need a gun in england
nottheonion,not_removed,more they were afraid of her gun not of her without a gun its people preying on a single woman and thats assuming they dont have their own gun illegally
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like some people got inspired from the strangers
nottheonion,not_removed,you called it a terror movie ha
nottheonion,not_removed,if youre wearing a clown mask at night and youre not doing a gig you dont deserve a warning shot
nottheonion,not_removed,found the juggaloo
nottheonion,not_removed,if it was a rifle it could have been a bolt action rounds in the magazine but not in the chamber she may have seen him trying to load it by pulling the bolt back and pushing it forward that motion and sound is extremely obvious
nottheonion,not_removed,just like sex
nottheonion,not_removed,dayton ohio wdtn – dayton police responded to a report of a shots fired call thursday it happened just after pm in the block of hart street in dayton the victim told police that she was preparing dinner in the kitchen when she saw a reflection in the lenses of her glasses when she turned around there was a male at the back door with an unknown long rifle according to a dayton police report she said the man was wearing a clown mask a longsleeved black shirt black gloves and black jeans the man was telling the woman to open the back door that was locked at the time the victim ran into the living room where she was able to see two other men in her front yard thats when she grabbed her black revolver handgun according to the police report the suspect with the clown mask ran into the yard thats when the woman exited her house and saw the suspect with the mask point the rifle at her and try to load his weapon she reportedly told the suspect to drop his weapon and he did not thats when she fired a warning shot into the garage the suspects ran into an unknown direction
nottheonion,not_removed,the real question is why didnt the guy load his rifle before trying to commit armed robbery
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah thats crazy she honestly probably could have shot him and been in no legal trouble since he was supposedly pointing a gun at her and trying to load it good that they ran off scared instead of staying to fight and shooting back at her
nottheonion,not_removed,well you cant change titles on reddit so that answers the first part
nottheonion,not_removed,this subreddit doesnt allow you to change the title of the actual article while the title is misleading it is still the title given to it by the authorwebsite
nottheonion,not_removed,the rules of the subreddit are that title has to be verbatim its the writer that is being an asshat and to ops credit they did nothing to obfuscate the meaning of the article its there for us to read its not their fault that no one reads the article on reddit edit also that looks like a local station so the writers were right to report it in this fashion although they should have included the term intruder on the other hand its just this womans word so they may not want to call this man what he may not be but locals should be aware that a man in a clown mask may be trying to break into single womens homes
nottheonion,not_removed,or dont spend time on this sub if you are just looking for news
nottheonion,not_removed,the title has to be the exact title as the article so you cant change the title
nottheonion,not_removed,thats how i feel i dont think people on here have ever read the onion before last post i submitted here was something like peace activist say calling for peace not stopping violence that shit was gold but it got removed because it wasnt onion material
nottheonion,not_removed,its not a click bait article its a click bait title what happened is definitely worth reading about men in clown masks with at least rifle attempted to enter this womans home full knowing she was inside shits cray
nottheonion,not_removed,thats not the point the title doesnt describe the content shooting at unarmed people vs armed people that you feel threatened by are completely different situations
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont really want to argue hypotheticals here of what she should and shouldnt have done i dont advocate guns but i agree that this is a textbook case of it is good that this woman owned a gun although the more i think about it the more i wonder why she didnt report the attempted breakin herself if these guys are wandering around the more i wonder the more i think about what a perfect story this would be if it was made up and covering for whatever reason there was shooting but i have no idea and no evidence to the contrary
nottheonion,not_removed,doesnt want to murder i wouldnt consider that murder i would call it self defense
nottheonion,not_removed,in a lot of places if you fire a warning shot then youre not in enough danger to be actually using the gun to defend yourself and you can be charged
nottheonion,not_removed,nope she fire a gun that bullet is going somewhere people get killed by stray bullets everyday if you feel the need to discharge a round you better be willing to kill
nottheonion,not_removed,well yea to an extent the article says that she fired into her garage for the warning shot but it still seems reckless to be shooting at anything except the armed psychopathic clowns in her front yard i would much rather be reading about some stupid fuck in a clown costume being killed while acting like an asshole than about some poor woman getting murdered because she decided to give them the chance to back off
nottheonion,not_removed,dont do that in most states like florida you can be charged for warning shots
nottheonion,not_removed,the doctrine of least force necessary to subdue the threat disagrees with you going for the killshot where a warning or other nonlethal response would do is at least where i live illegal
nottheonion,not_removed,no warning shot for me
nottheonion,not_removed,yup or you find an article that is totally oniony then try to submit it only to find that site banned from submissions by the sub like usa today for example
nottheonion,not_removed,moms spaghetti
nottheonion,not_removed,i believe it is illegal in some states to fire warning shots it is incredibly reckless
nottheonion,not_removed,article says she shot at into her garage door edit added into
nottheonion,not_removed,not to mention they are reckless hard to know where that bullet will go unless she fired it into the ground which could still ricochet well yes but that applies even more if you fire at a person if you either miss or the bullet overpenetrates you have a bullet flying around at the optimal altitude to kill another human so while warning shots pose some risk theyre magnitudes safer than actually firing at a person especially if you shoot in the ground and even firing in the air is surprisingly safe though i wouldnt suggest it
nottheonion,not_removed,right giving people permanent debilitating injuries isnt all that much better than killing them same reason i couldnt get through the netflix daredevil easily he justified throwing someone from a roof and putting them into a coma with at least i didnt kill him
nottheonion,not_removed,in college i took a self defense class they had us yell a lot of curse words to get used to it women in my generation im were taught to never swear so it was really liberating it scares off potential attackers when hes cussing you out and youre not paralyzed with fear ive only had to use this twice and both times they took off pretty quick
nottheonion,not_removed,absolutely this
nottheonion,not_removed,this is exactly what they told me in my ohio concealed carry class you can respond with lethal force if there a threat of lethal force or possibility of serious bodily injury warning shots are reckless and illegal in most cases
nottheonion,not_removed,its also really dangerous if youre shooting a warning shot you probably dont have the time to evaluate exactly where that bullet is going which means it can go anywhere
nottheonion,not_removed,anyone who downvotes you is a fool a firearm for protection is not a tool for intimidation its a tool to stop an immediate life threatening threat that is all
nottheonion,not_removed,my question is this if your about to be attacked by someone who you pretty much know can kick your ass and you have your gun to protect yourself with would it legal then to shoot
nottheonion,not_removed,is this true for brandishing a firearm in self defense as well without actually firing it
nottheonion,not_removed,interesting i see the logic but i dont know if your average person would know that to me it seems like a warning shot is a chance to end it without any loss of life i would probably give one but then i become the aggressor and can be charged i hope people like this lady arent prosecuted for trying to save lives edit arent
nottheonion,not_removed,having to sit there and calculate what the person who shouldnt be on my property is going to do is pretty bullshit if someone trespasses coming at me saying theyre going to beat me up i have no idea if they will or wont if theyll just beat me a little a lot kill me etc you shouldnt have to figure out in that small and tiny moment what their intentions are and what they are capable of thats not your fucking job the only thing that matters is protecting yourself i shouldnt have to tiptoe around when im potentially in danger id pull a gun out if i had one to make them fuck off and that should be legal if they keep coming you should be able to hinder them nonfatally shoot them so you dont kill a person even if they have no weapons but they keep coming after you then they deserve to die they forfeited their life trying to harm you
nottheonion,not_removed,so just because some would prefer death means that we should discount all chance of saving lives yes and i agree with that you have to accept that firing a gun always has the chance to kill someone if you look i talk with someone about how i would fix it legally and also explains the reasons behind the changes but in essence i say that a warning shot has the same weight as a shot to kill it is only an option available to someone that you dont have to take
nottheonion,not_removed,indeed same as the yeehaw bubba gun nut however voting democrat this season is not going to end well for gun rights😧
nottheonion,not_removed,i think the issue is that many antigun people would want laws in place preventing her from having the gun in the first place citation needed
nottheonion,not_removed,but be realistic you can only take the gun from the lady thats why gun nutslaw following citizens who take responsibility for their protection hate your logic no law is going to stop guys that are robbing a fucking house from having a gun just make armed robbery illegal
nottheonion,not_removed,one gun per person is not enough some people can and should be legally obligated to use two guns at once
nottheonion,not_removed,a day after i decided to purchase a handgun i bought an unused ruger in minutes with cash in arizona for about if you can do that in the uk consider me impressed
nottheonion,not_removed,also a fan of the strangers i know i like bad movies i was unaware of how bad others thought this one was though
nottheonion,not_removed,more like hush if you havent seen it its pretty good
nottheonion,not_removed,no one has been inspired by the strangers unless it was to utterly give up on horror movies
nottheonion,not_removed,fair enough but the original story about a clown trying to lure kids into the woods was bullshit that the kids made up then suddenly it started happening in other places and now places are banning clown costumes entirely as if if someone wanted to hurt or murder someone hearing sorry no clowns would prevent them from a killing someone and b dressing up like a clown i dont know why i care its not like i was planning to dress up like a clown massive stupidity just annoys me also i was planning on dressing like a clown and murdering kids and now i cant
nottheonion,not_removed,what are you some kind of tantra master
nottheonion,not_removed,thisand why would you try pointing it before you loaded
nottheonion,not_removed,ironically shooting to kill is actually more legally defensible for the most part there might be regional variations blah blah than a warning shot shooting to kill demonstrates you legitimately feared for your life ie your last resort warning shots demonstrate that you werent in immediate danger because you wouldve shot to kill
nottheonion,not_removed,if i fired intending to kill and missed id probably just tell the cops that i fired a warning shot
nottheonion,not_removed,the technology doesnt exist yet
nottheonion,not_removed,like seriously where on earth do people think they are
nottheonion,not_removed,its not a click bait article its a click bait title while only titles can be clickbait the fifth paragraph cant possibly be what got anyone to click this title is merely shitty and misleading weve had terms for headlines like that for centuries shitty and misleading clickbait on the other hand refers to headlines that intentionally hide the lede so that the reader is enticed to click to find out said lede clickbait hides ledes this headline created a false lede or we can just use clickbait to mean i dont like this as seems to be customary
nottheonion,not_removed,but it a home invasion doesnt sound much like an onion article
nottheonion,not_removed,the more i wonder the more i think about what a perfect story this would be if it was made up and covering for whatever reason there was shooting yep probably this the story details are highly questionable to say the least
nottheonion,not_removed,you still have to live with self defense for the rest of your life
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah warning shots occasionally kill bystanders
nottheonion,not_removed,its stupid to fire a warning shot anyway
nottheonion,not_removed,however where i live its illegal to fire a warning shot if you fire a warning shot that shows that you know youre not in enough danger to justifiably fire your gun and you can be charged
nottheonion,not_removed,i clearly stated that before you even get your gun out you should have determined it is the only option that would keep you alive your cherry picking my statement
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know where youre from but in the us which is where the article happened warning shots are a really bad idea someone comes up to you intended to do harm and so you draw your weapon at this point the only legal justification for drawing your weapon is if you are in fear for your life and the only way to stop them is to draw the gun if you arent then its an assault with a deadly weapon charge right there if you fire a warning shot the prosecutor or the attorney for the guy whos attacking you if its a civil case can then argue in court that you werent really in fear for your life and that the guy wasnt really a threat to you because you clearly did not need to shoot him if you had needed to shoot him you would have shot him but by virtue of the fact that you had the safety and time to choose to fire elsewhere youve just proven that you were not in immediate danger this is also why you should never talk to police after using a firearm for selfdefense until youve talked to your lawyer because even the simplest emotional statement like i didnt want to kill him which is definitely a reasonable response to make after realizing you fucking killed someone can land you in some serious hot water if the local prosecutor is particularly heavyhanded because that can then be used against you in court
nottheonion,not_removed,yes she should have shot the person with the rifle instead to legally protect herself
nottheonion,not_removed,says into garage
nottheonion,not_removed,the key to either scenario though is knowing what the muzzle of your firearm is covering typically speaking warning shots are fired at random often without thinking covering a subject with your weapon and shouting verbal commands and firing when there is a clear threat is much less reckless not even close because the foundation of responsible firearm use are the basic safety rules of which one is knowing your target and whats beyond assuming a shooter knows that the correct course is no warning shot no reputable firearms instructor advocates warning shots
nottheonion,not_removed,granted its horrible but i dont believe that disabled people cant live meaningful lives despite their predicament
nottheonion,not_removed,ianal but you generally need a reasonable belief that your life is in immediate danger details and gray areas vary by state some require you to do more to attempt escape than others especially depending on whether you are in your own home see trayvon martin and george zimmerman for a recent controversial example
nottheonion,not_removed,cya disclaimer im not a lawyer do your own research if you can prove that grave bodily harm was imminent then yes there is precedence supporting a much smaller and weaker victim being aggressively approached with verbal intent to harm so if the ass kicker has shown clear intent to do grave bodily harm and is clearly capable of it then yes the advice i would give is to always attempt to deescalate the situation before you draw your weapon that can be saying no i dont want trouble while creating distance between you and the attacker some states even require you to attempt to retreat before using force however if they continue their aggression and get close enough to throw a knife im throwing lead
nottheonion,not_removed,if someone is attacking you there is no way to know what their intentions are people die from punches to the face head injuries and bleeding from fights and stabbing bottom line is if you feel like your life is in danger you have every right to stop the threat edit not a lawyer but have taken the hour ccw twice what i learned is that the law is almost grey area deciding to carry is deciding to take on huge responsibility and accept major consequences if you use is completely justified or not
nottheonion,not_removed,percent thats pretty much why concealed carry is allowed
nottheonion,not_removed,if they could kill you with brute force and they look like theyre going to do just that then they are the deadly weapon and you are cleared to shoot
nottheonion,not_removed,in most places you need a reasonable belief that youre in danger of death or serious injury and you may need to attempt to retreat if youre being attacked by an mma fighter that would probably qualify being jumped by six guys saying theyre going to beat you to death same deal your best bet in a confrontation where you feel seriously threatened is to try to retreat then if that doesnt work to draw your weapon and retreat if theyre still pursuing you at that point it wouldnt be a stretch to argue they intended to kill you
nottheonion,not_removed,in some statesbut only if this person is forcing their way onto your property and you have a reasonable belief they will commit another crime once inside and you have warned them loudly several times that youll shoot
nottheonion,not_removed,brandishing isnt a crime in most places itd likely be assault if you drew and threatened someone without good cause you should never draw a firearm unless you feel you need to shoot someone that is only if youre faced with the imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury it may work as a lastditch effort to deescalate a dangerous situation but guns usually just make violent situations more violent and youd better be both ready to shoot and justified in doing so
nottheonion,not_removed,im not a lawyer and i dont anal either but it depends on the situation if another parent insults you at your kids softball game and you lift up your shirt to show them your gun youve just made a threat if assuming the last sentence didnt happen that parent picks up a bat and starts walking towards you aggressively and you draw on them then they drop it and you dont shoot them you did the right thing the point isnt that you have to shoot if you draw the point is that if youre forced to shoot its because you are in danger in this case drawing the gun is warning enough if youre taking your eye off of the threat to shoot into the air or ground where it could still ricochet you werent in danger and cant justify having fired if you dont take your eye off them and just blindly fire then you are endangering everybody around you
nottheonion,not_removed,youve gotten really good answers here the rule is simple never draw your weapon unless you fully intend to fire it at your attacker if the mere act of drawing your weapon scares them off everyone gets to have a good day
nottheonion,not_removed,do you own a gun its ok if you dont and dont know this whats scary is gunowners who never bothered to learn appropriate usage
nottheonion,not_removed,anyone who buys a gun they ever think might be used for self defense has a duty to know their local useofforce laws
nottheonion,not_removed,what sort of citation are you asking for if some examples of laws that people have attempted to pass will do then im happy to get that
nottheonion,not_removed,whilst jumping through the air
nottheonion,not_removed,people should be legally required to own a nuke
nottheonion,not_removed,he didnt say one per person but yeah one isnt enough so much variation between a rifle shotgun and pistol to pick only one
nottheonion,not_removed,i actually thought this movie was terrifying had no idea people thought it was bad but i get creeped out being home alone as it is
nottheonion,not_removed,movies like this one scare me the most because they are possible theres no crazy monsters or zombies just psychopaths with weapons and people trapped like rats in a cage
nottheonion,not_removed,are you sure people consider it bad the worst ive heard said about it was meh personally i think its the best horror movie in the last twenty years besides the babadook i can count on one hand the horror movies that scare me and thats one of them ninja edit never mind there are people in this thread saying it was garbage thats really surprising
nottheonion,not_removed,i both respectively and vehemently disagree the protagonist was awful she could have ended it at least halfway through the movie
nottheonion,not_removed,i actually really enjoyed it to each their own i guess
nottheonion,not_removed,wow could not disagree more felt it was the best horror movie in the past decade
nottheonion,not_removed,still better than most modern horror
nottheonion,not_removed,there have been cases of children attempting to be stolen and people being attacked by clowns here in north carolina up by the woods i guess the hysteria trend in media about these killer clowns has made actual psychopaths go out dressed as clowns to go hurt people
nottheonion,not_removed,i wish i heard some of those guys can last a minute or more
nottheonion,not_removed,thisand bringing a rifle to a home invasion
nottheonion,not_removed,i tried to kill him judge i really did my aim was off thats all im not buying a word of it that was clearly a warning shot i have no choice but to put you away for life
nottheonion,not_removed,its also better for you in the long run if you have to shoot someone kill them so they dont sue later but practically if you need to use a gun you need to kill wounding doesnt happen irl every gunshot is a potential fatality youre not going to hit him in the shoulder to warnspare him and hope hes just peachy and wiser as a result
nottheonion,not_removed,exactly this although shooting to end the threat is preferred for juryprosecutor reasons avoiding the word kill qualifying disclaimer every situation is different trainers and lawyers will tend to give varying advice this topic is contentious as hell and always spawns a shitshow of a comment thread but in the typical feet shots seconds ive been advised to dump as much of your magazine into their center of mass as you can stopping immediately when they go down or they turn to flee if you keep shooting while theyre running or after theyve fallen youll be painted as a vigilante executioner bullets left in your magazine warning shots or shots purposefully put away from center of mass can be used to demonstrate that you werent properly fearing for you life and it was a bad shoot what will probably happen is that all your planning will go out the window hopefully your muscle memory from the training you better be doing on the regular preserves your mechanics and youll panic empty your weapon into the threats prepare to be dragged and crucified by the media and tried in the court of public opinion im whiteif the worst comes to worst and i ever have to defend myself i hope to hell my assailant is white the advice on what to do immediately after a shooting varies so much that i wont even go there just make sure you have a lawyer and that he arrives not to long after the police and ambulance all in all its a crap shoot and varies by community and politics it comes down to tried by or carried by
nottheonion,not_removed,and the fact she left the safety of her locked house to go outside to fire the warning shot means she was not fearing for her life
nottheonion,not_removed,its definitely more defensible in florida with the castle doctrine and stand your ground
nottheonion,not_removed,do not do this warning shots are illegal in a lot of places trying to shoot to kill isnt
nottheonion,not_removed,just dont talk to cops at all lawyer up you got rights
nottheonion,not_removed,i wouldnt unless you want to get charged with a felony
nottheonion,not_removed,actually there are many ways around it but most people dont know will surprise you how simple it is
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,hey i know i just raped you and murdered your whole family but im going to run away now so you cant touch me unless you want to go to jail 🙃 ps im coming back for you when you least expect it you shouldnt be able to do shit like this then when the person defending themselves finally gets the upper hand and the aggressor knows theyre going to lose so they bolt and then you cant do anything logic
nottheonion,not_removed,from indiana i dont have to retreat lucky me
nottheonion,not_removed,what are you talking about did you read the story the suspect with the clown mask ran into the yard thats when the woman exited her house and saw the suspect with the mask point the rifle at her and try to load his weapon it would be self defense since he is pointing a firearm at her she wasnt out of danger till after the warning shot scared them off stop pulling bullshit law statutes out of your ass show me what law in ohio proves your points and ill wait cause they dont exist furthermore her firing a warning shot instead of shooting to kill confirms in the eyes of the law that she was not in imminent danger because if she was she would have had no time to think i should fire a warning shot and then wait to see what happens and opens her up to gun charges including negligenceandor unlawful discharge of a weapon in a residential area if she would of hit the clown without killing him she would of opened herself up to that lawsuit as well theres no such thing as warning shots or justifiable maiming in the eyes of the law you either legally defend yourself with a lethal use of force or you are financially liable for maiming someone in my state it is even illegal to flash a weapon at someone it is only legal to unholster when something needs to die now
nottheonion,not_removed,or you live in texas and they dont give a fuck of you kill an intruder how it should be
nottheonion,not_removed,just so everyone is clear in the us no such thing as a warning shot you just are considered just a bad aim and probably an attempted murderer
nottheonion,not_removed,can confirm if you can retreat its not self defense worked in prison
nottheonion,not_removed,unload the entire gun into the clown got it loading up and heading out now i am kidding
nottheonion,not_removed,in regards to the whole clown running away from her and into the yard part would she still not have been able to claim self defense since the clown aimed the rifle at her and was loading it so if she had shot the clown it would have been justified
nottheonion,not_removed,once the clown ran into the yard she was out of danger but wasnt she technically cornered people in the front in the backyard
nottheonion,not_removed,firing a warning shot cant confirm that someone is not imminent danger if a group of knifewielding fellow surround you you are certain in imminent danger but if theyre at far enough range and you have a big magazine may a warning shot not be preferable here in sweden our policemen regularly use warning shots so its cant really be negligent although of course it may be negligent legally furthermore if someone shoots to kill after having fired a warning shot that is after the warning shot so even a danger that was not imminent wen the warning shot was fired may be imminent then
nottheonion,not_removed,as opposed to being dead for the rest of your life because you didnt defend yourself
nottheonion,not_removed,when its justified like this i dont think that would be a problem this seems like a very him or me situation
nottheonion,not_removed,ehh it wouldnt weigh on my conscience too much if that person was trying to harm me
nottheonion,not_removed,this is the correct answer a lot of absolute bs in this thread right now warning shots can land you in hot shit when it comes to both criminal or civil law and you are expressly warned by firearm instructors to not give warning or limb shots every shot is a potential kill shotincluding bystanders if youre firing a weapon at all you damn well better be sure its because your life is in imminent threat and youre justified to shoot the target if there is lesser force able to subdue the threat then you shouldnt be shooting at them in the first place a firearm is deadly force period
nottheonion,not_removed,whoops sorry about that
nottheonion,not_removed,being in a coma isnt a meaningful life though
nottheonion,not_removed,i was talking more about painsuffering inflicted by batmandaredevil characters they claim moral high ground while ruining life for a given baddie while a disabled person is still able to live a meaningful life it is very difficult to adjust to having to go without a bodily function they had before
nottheonion,not_removed,ianal im sorry but im not completely familiar with some of these acronyms
nottheonion,not_removed,ive had people spit at me or shove me while carrying my handgun i just smile and apologize or keep walking deescalation is a necessary part of carrying a weapon unless youre a cop it seems like
nottheonion,not_removed,in no duty to retreat states they dont even have to be on your property
nottheonion,not_removed,ive spent a lot of time on a variety of firearms forums and many if the i had to draw my ccw stories tend to end with the bad guy running away but there is a difference between someone on the street attacking you and someone breaking into your home to attack you my thought is if they dont turn and run when they see you draw the gun then you have no choice but to start shooting at that point youve shown your hand and if they keep advancing then you can only assume they intend to seriously harm or kill you i would never recommend anyone brandish their firearm as a way to stop a threat but dont shoot if the bad guy decides youre not worth dieing for
nottheonion,not_removed,by the law yes but she didnt want to kill a person if it came to it i bet she would but she like many people tried to avoid it up until the last taking a life is a heavy thing and something you can never take back or fix also typo on the last bit arent not are
nottheonion,not_removed,my family does but i dont plus it is just a over under for sporting clays
nottheonion,not_removed,doing somersaults
nottheonion,not_removed,thats what got me the most with that movie just the line because you were home still kind of gives me chills
nottheonion,not_removed,its actually based on a true story
nottheonion,not_removed,ask rmovies about the strangers im sure youll get a lot of negative responses personally i think its fantastic one of my favorite movies one of the most legitimately terrifying to me
nottheonion,not_removed,the horror movie genre has some of the most hard to please fans you can find i enjoyed it
nottheonion,not_removed,try the movie hush if youre looking for a solid home invasion horror movie
nottheonion,not_removed,i have never met anyone who thought the strangers was anything but really scary and a great horror movie id be really impressed if someone could watch that alone in the dark late at night and then walk to bed in the dark without getting scared id be scared to death
nottheonion,not_removed,i liked it too
nottheonion,not_removed,right after the initial bullshit story the point is if people want to hurt people clown costumes being banned wont make them stop
nottheonion,not_removed,i fired three warning shots to the head after the first shot suspect complied with my instructions to lay down
nottheonion,not_removed,their family can and will sue you
nottheonion,not_removed,the whole point is that you are in danger so if you remove the danger by wounding then go finish him with an execution style headshot i could see you being prosecuted for that
nottheonion,not_removed,my pistol holds rounds but ill empty it if you say so
nottheonion,not_removed,its illegal in florida to fire warning shots
nottheonion,not_removed,lots of states have those doctrines warning shots arent allowed anywhere
nottheonion,not_removed,how in the fuck does that make any sense at all you cant threaten to kill someone but you can actually kill them
nottheonion,not_removed,username umwell i like to think krieg would know
nottheonion,not_removed,id be willing to bet that people being prosecuted for that kind of self defense is not common
nottheonion,not_removed,just because someone some does something horrible to you doesnt mean you have the right to shoot them in the back as they run the point is to be the better person not to get revenge if you want revenge just say that but lets not pretend like the law should promote shooting people in the back i understand some states justify shooting people who are fleeing but unless yours or someone elses life is actually in danger its ridiculous to think you personally should have a right to shoot them down
nottheonion,not_removed,police in texas wait the guy came onto your property and you fired a shot at him whyd you only fire one you had shots left in your pistol geez lady get yo shit together
nottheonion,not_removed,always thought that was stupid rule i have to change all my shit because some prick wont leave me alone
nottheonion,not_removed,not true in most states in the us
nottheonion,not_removed,well if youre dead the whole living with it for the rest of your life thing is kind of short lived
nottheonion,not_removed,idk about her countrystate but most places require you to use the minimum force necessary to subdue the threat where i live going for the killshot or intentionally firing mutliple rounds where one would do would certainly be murder
nottheonion,not_removed,and you would make a great candidate for the army in that case the analogy which a onetime murdering of someone vs being in war for years is far from perfect but some guys come back from war and are relatively fine wihle others have their life and mental state in shambles for years and decades you wont lose any sleep but many others would and it should be a consideration
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont believe you i have read so many testimonials from red blooded strong tough guys normally in combat situations who say that when they killed a man it changed them for the worse for the rest of their lives nightmares and not being able to forget the targets face ever etc
nottheonion,not_removed,have you ever killed someone even if they were trying to kill you
nottheonion,not_removed,if you have a gun the only warning should be them seeing you with it if i were a burglar and i saw the homeowner with a gun i am automatically going to assume they can use it and will use it to make me dead i guess there may be a situation where saying hey clown with a gun i also have a gun and will shoot you if said clown does not run or is pointing their gun at you then you have to shoot a clown which is a shame because they are rarely in season and tend to taste funny
nottheonion,not_removed,in both cases over penetration is a thing and can hit something beyond the garage or if its the door a ricochet can happen hitting the soft body of the man with a gun is safer for her and everyone who wasnt pointing a gun at her
nottheonion,not_removed,its substantially easier to come out of a coma than a grave guns allow us to make irrevocable decisions faster than we can comprehend i like seeing restraint even when its not necessarily logical and its more difficult
nottheonion,not_removed,i am not a lawyer its a funny but useful contraction
nottheonion,not_removed,because texas
nottheonion,not_removed,the point is that nobody wants to have to kill someone thats why the gun is the absolute last last last resort option you only pull the gun in order to kill and to save your life if it came to it i bet she would but she like many people it did come to it if she used the gun
nottheonion,not_removed,sport shooting is a blast if you feel like youve stepped into another world you have self defense gun use is much more than firing accurately and keeping the muzzle downrange if you ever decide youd like a self defense gun i strongly encourage you to research the legal and moral implications in the gravest extreme is my gun bible
nottheonion,not_removed,good movie i didnt like where when he finally got the shotgun the movie didnt end i mean come on you have a gun now start blasting some holes in shit other than your friend and youre golden who messes with a guy hoisting a shotty
nottheonion,not_removed,i liked it follows
nottheonion,not_removed,i find this comment interesting im not crazy about the genre and part of the reason why is because while some horror films stand out the majority of them ive seen arent usually of the highest quality so are horror fans really hard to please or are they properly selective
nottheonion,not_removed,challenge accepted
nottheonion,not_removed,to be fair i think part of what makes movies scary is the situation youre in while watching it almost all scary movies would make someone paranoid if they watched it in the situation you described dont get me wrong the strangers is one of few movies to really scare me and make me feel uncomfortable being home alone at night but watch it in the middle of the day with a group of friends over and youll spend the whole time pointing out funny bits and making jokes still loved this movie though
nottheonion,not_removed,i only watched it late at night in the dark with noise canceling headphones its not worth watching any other way
nottheonion,not_removed,its a court order it says you cant eat shit anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,ah a best of the worst scenario
nottheonion,not_removed,the second and third shots were necessary because he was no longer responding to my verbal instructions
nottheonion,not_removed,lmao you know full well this generally applies to typical ccwdefensive handguns and not some of the more daka that some of us choose to defend our residences with advice typically isnt given for pistols running rpk mags
nottheonion,not_removed,more rounds than a standard assault rifle magazine the fuck man you are carrying a mini machine gun
nottheonion,not_removed,not saying i agree with this but i think the idea is if you arent willing to shoot to killyou dont need to shoot at all in order to prevent people from firing guns frivolously or from firing warning shots that miss and actually kill someone they decided to make it law that you only should shoot if youre intending to killdisable someone to protect yourself that means guns should only be fired in situation is serious enough that if you hit and kill them its justified
nottheonion,not_removed,because a warning shot is still a potentially a killing shot but now you have no idea what its going to hit basically reckless endangerment type of deal
nottheonion,not_removed,more like threatening to kill vs self defense
nottheonion,not_removed,where does your warning shot land you are responsible for every bullet the second it leaves the barrel blindly firing one off into the air or a random direction is idiotic
nottheonion,not_removed,warning shots are using a method of deadly force without having met the bar for use of deadly force
nottheonion,not_removed,because youre already admitting they didnt need to be shot yet and oh lots of things like firing rounds can ricochet and hit unintended bystanders in their homes or on the street even just firing into the air that bullet comes down somewhere the standard accepted top rule of firearms is to even point it unless you intend to kill and know your target
nottheonion,not_removed,chance of hitting a bystander increases a lot
nottheonion,not_removed,do not take legal advice from reddit
nottheonion,not_removed,if you are at the point where you need to fire the weapon its because your life depends on it if you are firing warning shots you obviously werent at that point
nottheonion,not_removed,nope krieg would just punch himself in the face five times in a row

nottheonion,not_removed,id be willing to bet that people running away from guns and getting shot in the back is pretty damn common
nottheonion,not_removed,its not about being the better person youre already the better person just by not breaking into peoples homes the reason to shoot them is theyve already proven they want something from you and are willing to break in to get it theres no proof they wont come back when you arent as prepared and possibly escalate things when they do the alternative would be to have police protection until they are captured good luck with that
nottheonion,not_removed,they ran out and were reloading
nottheonion,not_removed,i definitely dont disagree with you outright revenge is a stupid reason someone fleeing a non violent crime is also a stupid reason an armed person fleeing a violent crime is a moral grey are imo that person could jack someones car down the street and shoot them the cops could corner them and have an armed standoff they could get away scott free and rob someone else at gun point later personally if i have a masked armed robber at gunpoint in my yard and they take off they better drop their firearm first im not going to let that mess become someone elses problem thats a personal choice however and not a gun owners responsibility and thats with the benefit of hindsight and not in the heat of the moment when no one knows exactly how they will respond
nottheonion,not_removed,its not even about being the better person its just about discouraging people from being vigilantestaking the law into their own hands im from the uk and im pretty shocked at this entire thread really the ohio laws sound entirely reasonable to me apart from the bit about warning shots unless i know for absolute sure that someone is going to come back and kill me what gives me the right to hunt them down even if theyve just shot one of my family are americans usually allowed to go around shooting people that they think might be criminals no because that would be insane
nottheonion,not_removed,yea ive been over several laws with my sister since she got her first gun main thing was to never shoot someone in the back or someone that is retreating as a defender we dont have to retreat which is nice as a concealed carrier
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess thats when you drag them inside before they bleed too much and make it obvious they fell backwards
nottheonion,not_removed,so wait til they are all the way in the house
nottheonion,not_removed,its one of the things we get right i think but we also get a lot of things wrong too like shutting down the majority of womens clinics and now i have to wait three months for gynecology appointments for my endometriosis
nottheonion,not_removed,whats wrong with dallas
nottheonion,not_removed,we have this cool thing where our government doesnt spend money if it doesnt have money
nottheonion,not_removed,so many things right like firefighting
nottheonion,not_removed,what if you wake up dead
nottheonion,not_removed,while thats true as in where i am here at least its proportional to threat if someone is standing at my door and gets angry and pushes me and i shoot him in the chest with a legal weapon thats not proportionally reasonable she had men on her frontlawn one of which loading a weapon and have already tried to gain access her shooting them in that particular situation seems proportionally rather fair its very fortunate she didnt need to kill anyone but i dont feel it would have been unjustified if shed hit id probably argue if youre reasonable you have to either argue she can pull the gun or cant not whether she can shoot it or not isnt the whole thing about guns is that you dont ever pull it unless youre willing to kill especially when someone else has one its an escalating factor edit disclaimer i have no idea about her legal rights or local laws just a point of view is all
nottheonion,not_removed,no it wouldnt every state in the union allows for one to defend their life and the extra bullet or two might be the thing that keeps it from being an issue when your life is threatened you shoot to stop the threat if the threat is facing you you shoot until they cant move and call the cops in a panic you dont shoot someone who is running away you dont shoot in the chest and one in the head like a pro and you dont go up to the body and unload the gun after they are down all of those things make it seem like you intended to purposely kill the intruder instead of defending yourself that said if you start shooting you better finish itcrooks know how to game the system much better than those of us with something to lose
nottheonion,not_removed,you fire until the threat is eliminated if they still are in death throws you can can justifiably keep shooting because theyre still moving and youre not a medical professional that can pronounce the suspect as dead also her pursuing outside of her house could count against her if she stood in her doorway and fired at them she isnt required to retreat into her house because she is in her home but when you are outside of your home youre obligated to retreat to safety and if thats not an option then fire at them ohio is weird am resident just got my conceal carry this past year and you have to read case law on top of the class on your own time just so you know your rights and what is acceptable to say goes back to miranda rights everything you say can be used against you in a court of law doesnt matter if youre the victim or not i feared for my life is basically your best phrase no more no less
nottheonion,not_removed,where do you live minimum force necessary with a gun is pretty hard to enforce ive never heard of a law that encourages shooting nonlethal shots with a firearm as thats generally considered near impossible and not taught by any selfdefense instructors to my knowledge
nottheonion,not_removed,but in combat its teams with no personal or rational reason to kill the other youre taking orders its like seeing a stranger at the mall and having to kill them because you were told to youd have nightmares yes they were given orders to kill you but its no the same as seeing someone who presents a danger to you based on their personal decision they decided to kill you not a third party killing them isnt as guiltcausing as war unless you meet that person and then you have to kill them by orders and not your own decision war is killing in coldblood that messes up people not self defense like this lady did i would have killed because they werent innocent a lot of innocent people are at war and in combat when someone decides to terrorize you theyre not innocent a lot innocent people are stupidly dressing up as clowns but if they die thats their fault because they should have had the common sense to know that doing so puts you in danger by making others feel like theyre in danger
nottheonion,not_removed,bases on post history that guy doesnt believe that the moon landing happened i would be skeptical of anything he says
nottheonion,not_removed,war is different from homicidal crime its a clash of ideologies not a display of malice
nottheonion,not_removed,also florida
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah although it is a good day when i hit higher than p in more serious matters that book sounds like what i am talking about it is a very serious thing to kill someone even the thought of it scares me however i am also seriously considering getting a self defense weapon when it is legal ie not in college and underage id feel like id undoubtedly use it if it came to it but i would try everything first to avoid killing because a life is a valuable thing and not to be taken unless it is dire circumstances
nottheonion,not_removed,i like chocolate
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt that the one thats basically a really long std psa
nottheonion,not_removed,howd it go
nottheonion,not_removed,and the remaining one hundred thirtyfour shots
nottheonion,not_removed,do not shoot to disable either it hurts your self defense claim as if you are in control and felt safe enough to take out a kneecap instead of just emptying a clip in their general direction you werent actually fearful that your life was in danger it sucks but never pull a weapon unless you are willing to use it and if you shoot shoot to kill
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought it was if you have time for a warning shot you werent in immediate danger so you didnt need to fire you gun in the first place but if you are shooting to kill you must have had to do it with no other choice so it was down to you or them
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont believe this is from buzzfeed because it doesnt mention anything about the patriarchy
nottheonion,not_removed,dont have to run away but instead just point the gun towards the person and if he doesnt leave immediately with his weapon down or dropped you can shoot if he draws the weapon shoot if he gets closer shoot
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree with you other people would give your assailant the benefit of the doubt when theyve already proven they dont deserve it
nottheonion,not_removed,i see it as reinforcing long term self defense you have the ability to eliminate that danger from yours and others future that probably seems pretty noble to some people
nottheonion,not_removed,conceeled cary uglockjam checks out
nottheonion,not_removed,why would they shut them down if there was demand for them
nottheonion,not_removed,sorry
nottheonion,not_removed,cowboys fans everywhere
nottheonion,not_removed,dallas and austin justice system tries to viffily the gun shooter san antonio el paso and houston on the other hand
nottheonion,not_removed,thats cool you also have massive amounts of gang activity the most latin american gang contingency outside of latin america as well as an economy completely propped up on illegal immigrants working for slave wages but yeah balanced budget good job
nottheonion,not_removed,jamal from street watched a killer video tape last week and this morning he woke up dead
nottheonion,not_removed,you get a mediocre web series that gets cancelled after one season
nottheonion,not_removed,you cant wake up dead because you can go to bed and not be dead and you can die and not be in the bed
nottheonion,not_removed,makes sense if you shoot with the intention of merely injuring thats a clear sign that your use of the gun was not justified because its obvious that you did not believe that the use of lethal force was absolutely necessary
nottheonion,not_removed,theres also another important factor stuff going on around you say whether youre subjected to a prolonged artillery barrage when ptsd was first initially identified as being a mental handicap having nothing to do with cowardice it was dubbed shell shock for this very reason
nottheonion,not_removed,i like tuttles
nottheonion,not_removed,my names jeffy and i like apples
nottheonion,not_removed,im more of a sweettarts guy myself but i do like some white chocolate from time to time
nottheonion,not_removed,kind of it is legitimately a good horror movie
nottheonion,not_removed,the belt only holds bullets your honor
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought shooting to disable or disarm was just a hollywood myth anyway sitting on a chair outside who was if i recall correctly threatening to kill himself but ive always understood that sort of shot to be a rarity edit added link to video
nottheonion,not_removed,instead of just emptying a clip in their general direction that is reckless you are supposed to know your target and what is beyond it not just dump rounds hoping to hit them
nottheonion,not_removed,if you are in control and felt safe enough to take out a kneecap instead of just emptying a clip in their general direction you werent actually fearful that your life was in danger that does not sound like a reasonable claim to make in court it sounds completely ridiculous not everyone panics so much that they cant think when theyre in a dangerous situation so how is that significant evidence
nottheonion,not_removed,but instead just point the gun towards the person and get a brandishing charge you cant use a gun as threat you can only use it to kill in self defense self defense laws are kind of fucked up in my state i could go to prison for shooting an armed intruder in my home if i had any other means of escape
nottheonion,not_removed,because if we left it to the states a lot of places would be fuckedeven with the federal government many states still make absolutely terrible decisions and laws that hurt them look at at the bathroom laws in the south or the south in general where asinine laws have caused millions in lost business and poverty states right right to fuck themselves over for backwards practices and poor economic policies
nottheonion,not_removed,it looked like he was holding a gun officer i feared for my life he was a strange man in my house i saw another at the front door i didnt have anywhere to run
nottheonion,not_removed,a quick summary this happened only a few years ago with a bill designed to shut down nearly all womens clinics to prevent abortions in texas the bill require all womens clinics to have the same surgical facilities as hospitals nearly none of them met those requirements as they were simply clinics which primarily did pap smears and similar tests and low tier treatments many low income women went to them as well so because nearly all of these clinics didnt meet these standards they were shut down in some areas of remote texas this left women needing to drive hours to another clinic for treatment for pregnancy regardless of whether or not it was planned pregnancy related deaths have sky rocketed since though admittedly they have been climbing since the law was declared unconstitutional this past summer but i havent heard of any clinics reopening since we went from clinics down to
nottheonion,not_removed,politics
nottheonion,not_removed,as an update this past summer the bill was deemed unconstitutional by the supreme court to my knowledge though none of the closed down clinics have reopened as of yet
nottheonion,not_removed,eh there are worse fans out there
nottheonion,not_removed,the border is massive there are parts of texas where you can just walk into mexico and vise versa the border is too big to police effectively unless you build a literal wall i dont agree with this but its what it would take meanwhile every election cycle dems promise to do something about immigration but when it comes time seems like everyone is cool with slave labor the problem is that no one can decide how to deal with the problem and its exacerbated by people like you who like to play the blame game instead of promote discourse good job
nottheonion,not_removed,we have a massive latin american population and a very long border with mexico thats gonna come with some drug wars and a larger amount of latin american gangs
nottheonion,not_removed,sucked the aorta out of his neck blood everywhere like a romero flick
nottheonion,not_removed,ahh a succubus

nottheonion,not_removed,its one of those poisonous doublespeak words that the rightwingers are so fond of in other words if you only believe that marriage should be man and woman and all other forms are sin and youre too outspoken about it to shut up about it while at work behind the counter get the fuck out thats not your job your job is to misspell names and insist on using the words from the board like venti any more than making loud excuses for why you voted for trump at work or excusing why entering a womens room and grabbing beauty pageant contenders is aok at work or in public while wearing a work uniform after all we know the true and traditional marriage is serial marriage with divorces of women but not for women to do that with men only that is acceptable and right

nottheonion,not_removed,who is
nottheonion,not_removed,depending on the tone of your post it could be viewed as getting fucked by white people or should it be
nottheonion,not_removed,someday ill find a use for mine a printer thats fueled by plastic bags would be pretty sweet
nottheonion,not_removed,no
nottheonion,not_removed,richer white people id imagine
nottheonion,not_removed,nah i just like to say it kind of like some people saying thanks obama
nottheonion,not_removed,they banned plastic bags a while back where im at so now i have a giant collection of paper bags under the sink
nottheonion,not_removed,holy fuck thats actually such a good idea one bag melted down could probably make a surprising amount of ink
nottheonion,not_removed,would it work though with bags made out of quickly decomposable material weve had plastic shopping bags for a while now that decompose in short few months
nottheonion,not_removed,rich white people are such assholes
nottheonion,not_removed,in ca that translates in a waste of per we figured its easier to get reusable and keep a few in all cars or just order delivery on a regular basis
nottheonion,not_removed,somebody pointed out there might be a decomposition problem because of the way the bags are made now still though this could be a great kickstarter idea with a bit more fleshing out of the idea
nottheonion,not_removed,i would think if it were concentrated into a solid form it wouldnt decompose the same way would it im no scientist though
nottheonion,not_removed,awww poor baby somebody said something you didnt like so youre gonna get all uppity about it i love it when insults directly pertain to the person slinging them delicious delicious irony

nottheonion,not_removed,its my opinion blood is thicker than water commonwealth should stick together and that includes ireland
nottheonion,not_removed,im a little more on the brexit side myself but if he was from the nonuk ireland this is pretty ridiculous though perhaps he means the massive influx of refugees at least thats the only way i can rationalize this
nottheonion,not_removed,you are trolling right
nottheonion,not_removed,its not ridiculous irish people are given rights in the uk because ireland was a part of the uk and the empire like all commonwealth citizens irish people have the right to vote in the uk to my mind its reasonable
nottheonion,not_removed,just going to say brexit has nothing to do with refugees refugees are protected for want of a better word by international law all countries whether in or out of the eu must take responsibility for refugees if you have other reasons for brexit go ahead but i want you to be informed on this topic as you mentioned it
nottheonion,not_removed,the jewel in the crown
nottheonion,not_removed,sorry no i am halfcanadian so it biases me towards the commonwealth
nottheonion,not_removed,oh i know brexit and refugees are apples and oranges though a common argument i have seen for brexit is that immigration would be more controlled and streamlined as well as many other things
nottheonion,not_removed,also the fact that they get the vote and are generally treated as uk citizens
nottheonion,not_removed,ireland isnt in the commonwealth theyre famously very decided on that
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,no but the irish are granted special status in the uk as a former member ie all the benefits granted to citizens of commonwealth nations
nottheonion,not_removed,the equality and human rights commission has pledged to investigate the matter dont worry everybody they got this under control the ehrc never dissapoints
nottheonion,not_removed,reminds me of a landlord here in the
nottheonion,not_removed,incorrect clickbait headline his claim has nothing to do with locemaking time guzman — who escaped twice from highsecurity mexican prisons — told the doctor that guards were inflicting psychological torture on him according to a report released on wednesday he reported that lights in his cell were being kept on hours a day and that guards wake him up every four hours to appear on camera for roll calls he didnt even make the lovemaking time comment his wife did
nottheonion,not_removed,i feel bad for him that the actions he chose landed him in a state of incarceration that hes not happy with
nottheonion,not_removed,if hes doing poorly under such conditions he must be shitting himself about the possibility of being being extradited and landing up in adx florence
nottheonion,not_removed,the more i look at him the more he looks like the mexican version of jack black
nottheonion,not_removed,this guy gets lovemaking time
nottheonion,not_removed,lovemaking time thats a thing reading the headline i thought they meant masturbation but he actually gets to fuck his wife in jail
nottheonion,not_removed,youre telling me they dont want an
nottheonion,not_removed,i hope his cellmate is the affluenza kid
nottheonion,not_removed,she also said authorities have gone too far by cutting guzmans weekly lovemaking time with her from four hours to two thats more than i got from my cohabiting wife
nottheonion,not_removed,someone should tell him about masturbation
nottheonion,not_removed,after watching narcos i realised that these guys are more afraid of going to jail than death
nottheonion,not_removed,meanwhile in mexico
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,dig a tunnel and make him pay for it
nottheonion,not_removed,all that nervous energy could be put to good uselike digging a few miles of escape tunnel
nottheonion,not_removed,i had no idea they found him again why is it that i heard about the escape but not the capture
nottheonion,not_removed,this can be argued a million ways from all different angles and points of view but at the end of the day he earned every bad thing that comes his way dont want to be in prison dont do things that will get you thrown in prison dont want to be monitored every hours in prison dont do things in prison that will get you monitored every hours in prison he made his choices all him nobody else he is the shot caller unfortunately being at the top of the criminal heap doesnt mean you are smart it just means you are more ruthless than the others
nottheonion,not_removed,that piece of human garbage deserves to be euthanized responsible for hundreds if not thousands of deaths
nottheonion,not_removed,did they take his left hand
nottheonion,not_removed,no bopo por el chapo
nottheonion,not_removed,he can go fuck himself
nottheonion,not_removed,seconds into the video at the bottom of the linked story is a bottle of kirkland signature vitamin c pills in el chapos la piedrosa safe house who knew el chapo was a costco member
nottheonion,not_removed,he should join reddit
nottheonion,not_removed,just fapo el chapo
nottheonion,not_removed,they should just let the guards take turns sodomizing him so he has nothing to complain about
nottheonion,not_removed,anyone watch the video at the bottom apparently i use the same kirkland brand vitamin c that el chapo uses crazy
nottheonion,not_removed,dude its prison wtf do u want also he is was the head of one of the most ruthless mexican cartels ever known what did he think it would be like for him in there give me a break
nottheonion,not_removed,all he needs to do is get good at a sport get sentenced in america and the judge will let him off the hook since he wont do well in prison oh wait hes a mexican hes probably screwed then s
nottheonion,not_removed,someone get this guy laid so we can have avocados again
nottheonion,not_removed,those guards have huge baws
nottheonion,not_removed,the mercury makes the onion whodathunkit
nottheonion,not_removed,according to the sun stopped reading after that
nottheonion,not_removed,el loco
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like hes getting desperate about not being extradited
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,the movie adaptation of this will be val kilmers big return to hollywood
nottheonion,not_removed,reminds me of that norwegian terrorist anders breivik who claimed his rights were violated because he was given a instead of a
nottheonion,not_removed,his wife is fucking hot i would be pissed as well
nottheonion,not_removed,hahahahahahaha
nottheonion,not_removed,i think they should get some men and women on death row to have an orgy with his wife film it then give it to chapi and tell him to masturbate often fucking criminal
nottheonion,not_removed,moderators have set this subreddit to private why do i get this
nottheonion,not_removed,good i hope he suffers in prison
nottheonion,not_removed,the only lovemaking he should get is being raped with a night stick
nottheonion,not_removed,cant he just ya know get donut rammed in prison
nottheonion,not_removed,compare him to hillary bush or blair he should be sainted
nottheonion,not_removed,guards wake him up every four hours he should try raising a baby
nottheonion,not_removed,lights in his cell were being kept on hours a day and that guards wake him up every four hours to appear on camera for roll calls that seems very reasonable
nottheonion,not_removed,every four hours isnt so bad according to fm us army field manual a human only needs hours of nonconsecutive sleep in a hour period
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe they should just decapitate him with a chainsaw hes probably more comfortable with that than having to appear somewhere every hours
nottheonion,not_removed,he needs love and cocaine
nottheonion,not_removed,my favourite time of all time in the day is locemaking time
nottheonion,not_removed,i wonder how much money the american government made by acquiring assets related to guzman over the years and then i wonder who his replacement is
nottheonion,not_removed,he should have thought about the lights being on hours when he decided to escape prison twice
nottheonion,not_removed,worked in mental health hospital lights on cannot hide under the covers checked on every hour he needs to nut up
nottheonion,not_removed,im a free man and i havent had a conjugal visit in six months michael boulton
nottheonion,not_removed,sad we cant say the same for breivik
nottheonion,not_removed,i am i dont think selling a product that some people dont like justifies any kind of incarceration
nottheonion,not_removed,american prison
nottheonion,not_removed,aka hell on earth
nottheonion,not_removed,plus no conjugal visits in federal prisons let alone federal supermax
nottheonion,not_removed,nacho libre
nottheonion,not_removed,so jack black
nottheonion,not_removed,yes it is true it is me nacho nachoooooooooooooooooo who
nottheonion,not_removed,is it him afterall he was on the lamb for years and have you seen them together in the same place at the same time thats his cover
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty sure hes a sociopath
nottheonion,not_removed,i wonder if hes still maintaining those inner thigh paintbrushes
nottheonion,not_removed,conjugal visits has been in lots of tv showsmovies i would think it is based on some form of reality not sure exactly how it works though
nottheonion,not_removed,king of the trap

nottheonion,not_removed,write a script and pitch it to hollywood
nottheonion,not_removed,that would be fantastic
nottheonion,not_removed,hehe thats awesome no comment will top that actually
nottheonion,not_removed,evil me is enjoying thisa lot
nottheonion,not_removed,im just more surprised that these guys actually exist like everything about pablo escobar seems like a made up story then there is another guy who is basically just like him wtf
nottheonion,not_removed,you dont get to the top by being dumb
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah but he is not special and if it wasnt him it would be somebody else this is what happens when you have a large demand and an unregulated market making him suffer will not solve the problem of drug cartels hell not even capturing him helps even a little they captured and killed pablo escobar and the drug problems remains the same one
nottheonion,not_removed,ovee his life prob tens of thousands
nottheonion,not_removed,yay an eye for an eye showing off that high degree of maturity and civilization like nothing else
nottheonion,not_removed,i read this in the voice of opera man im old
nottheonion,not_removed,didnt reddit stop with the whole supporting rape thing
nottheonion,not_removed,he wants to they just wont allow him enough lovemaking time
nottheonion,not_removed,bet hes raised kids then made them go kill a few other kids
nottheonion,not_removed,rchildfree
nottheonion,not_removed,thats exactly how it feels actually 👶🏻
nottheonion,not_removed,am i raising a baby without my knowledge people often said get lot of sleep before have a baby often on days that not working i wake up after hours and cant sleep again
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt torture funny you must be american
nottheonion,not_removed,on one hand its definitely unreasonable on a logical level on the other hand after that many escapes
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean thats the kind of thing we did as a part of our torture program lol
nottheonion,not_removed,classified as torture elsewhere
nottheonion,not_removed,of course is bad to wake him up every hours of course but maybe if he stops escaping every time he is not on camera
nottheonion,not_removed,well the army isnt exactly known for the most humane treatment of recruits if they thought that you only needed hours they would write it in there just so you cant complain
nottheonion,not_removed,honestly id be more comfortable with that than being woken up every hours
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe they should just decapitate him with a chainsaw httpsenwikipediaorgwikiscaphism would be too good for him
nottheonion,not_removed,yay an eye for an eye no way that could go wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,i had to scroll way too far to find someone who quoted him on that
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like a good way to make someone mentally ill
nottheonion,not_removed,still getting laid more than a redditor which redditor
nottheonion,not_removed,thinly veiled self contempt
nottheonion,not_removed,ouch true but ouch
nottheonion,not_removed,speak for yourself
nottheonion,not_removed,i know we all hate breivik and in honesty it would make me quite happy knowing he was rotting in a ditch somewhere but the way norway has treated him is a show of great strength as a community and real core belief in the values it holds you can tell a lot about a society that upholds its beliefs and principals even when confronted with the worst criminal in a countries history
nottheonion,not_removed,i heard they told him he could play skyrim and but then they handed him a to play it on those monsters
nottheonion,not_removed,you must be american but what did this an eye for an eye thing do for you you have one of the most flawed systems among western countries
nottheonion,not_removed,sarcasm not big where youre from
nottheonion,not_removed,drug lord what do you think this means do you think this means he owned a couple marijuana plants that he grew in his closet and sold in his neighborhood

nottheonion,not_removed,ya think
nottheonion,not_removed,were not all bad sociopaths
nottheonion,not_removed,interesting the only thing i remember seeing in movies is the spousegirlfriend talking with the guy through a window you know over a telephone or something
nottheonion,not_removed,well son when a man and a woman really love each other
nottheonion,not_removed,eyo chago chuma
nottheonion,not_removed,he was kicked out of iraq too
nottheonion,not_removed,literally every song ever is saying lyrics or repeating melodies or instruments and shit if there are no lyrics
nottheonion,not_removed,jack black and michael cera comedy duo
nottheonion,not_removed,shhh bby
nottheonion,not_removed,like i said you cant make this shit up
nottheonion,not_removed,huh el chapos recapture was huge news
nottheonion,not_removed,sure you can in a violence based rewards system the most ruthless and violent float to the top smarts has nothing to do with it eg he is in prison even after escaping multiple times and when he was in prison the first time or two he had basically all the amenities afforded to him of someone not in prison if he was smart he would have lead a normal life if he was smarter he would of served his time under cushy conditions and been released and if he was a real brainiac he wouldnt find himself in his current monitored situation facing extradition to the us
nottheonion,not_removed,he aint suffering he is whining his former prison stints werent punishments they were cushy slaponthewrist arrangements where he basically had the same amenities afforded to him and then some that people outside of prison do anyone who can get periods of hours of sleep as often as they want aint suffering if they were waking him up once every hours then yeah i could get on board with suffering but conjugal lovemaking visits and all the sleep food and housing on the taxpayers dime sorry like most bullies this guy is a nobrain whiny pussy when he cant get his way
nottheonion,not_removed,whoever decided that it is more mature to keep a proven mass murderer alive was wrong i dont agree with it at all and i do not think it is more civilized to keep dangerous people like him in a cell for their entire life he has caused immeasurable damage to his country and put countless bodies in the ground and still has reach even from within prison people like him can never go back to society and never be rehabilitated so why do we keep them in prison
nottheonion,not_removed,there will always be assholes
nottheonion,not_removed,i read somewhere that its making him go crazy
nottheonion,not_removed,locemaking time
nottheonion,not_removed,omg the flair with the vasectomy dates im dying
nottheonion,not_removed,is that the crazy cat lady sub
nottheonion,not_removed,one of the most pathetic subs ive seen on here
nottheonion,not_removed,why dont you just smoke a big fatty and go back to sleep
nottheonion,not_removed,no because one is forced to wake up while you arent
nottheonion,not_removed,after that many escapes you know in the german civil code escaping custody is not by itself a criminal offense its only the damage and harm it entails that are
nottheonion,not_removed,he should at least have red hot iron stabbed into his feet el chapo is one of the few people who really need to die in this world
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean every four hours is annoying but not the torture thing the torture thing is like every minutes sleeping for four hours waking up and then going back to bed for the other four is not unlike getting up to pee or something its no doubt frustrating but getting up once during the night is not going to drive you insane the way being unable to sleep for more than minutes at a time will likewise leaving the lights would get annoying but its not going to drive you out of your mind though i think providing him with one of those blindfold masks like old ladies in tv shows wear would be polite
nottheonion,not_removed,i for one would like some elaboration on torture programs
nottheonion,not_removed,no that is not you are just hoping that it would only be such things to feel better about the crimes your country committed because in reality the us torture programs include actual torture
nottheonion,not_removed,where also in this case its for a good reason that guy escaped twice already and he is killing thousands of people in fact i would classify him as prisoner of war and not as criminal
nottheonion,not_removed,if only the bastard deserves to be secretly given high high doses of benzos or alcohol for a few weeks straight then to be cut off cold turkey maybe he would convulse so violently he would break his leg or something
nottheonion,not_removed,well excuuuuuse me princess
nottheonion,not_removed,normally i would agree with you but the person in question has knowingly benefitted immensely from some of the most depraved evil acts ever committed against his fellow human beings i have no pity for him
nottheonion,not_removed,wonder if it means something in some language
nottheonion,not_removed,not doing it leads to self injury and suicide
nottheonion,not_removed,all of us combined lets be honest
nottheonion,not_removed,yes
nottheonion,not_removed,most of them all of them
nottheonion,not_removed,im british im all for rehabilitation but the luxuries provided to breivik are ridiculous cells a personal gym multiple games consoles a computer indefinite security all the free time he can dream of is simply too much to give to a mass murderer is completely unnecessary for his rehabilitation
nottheonion,not_removed,his guys killed my uncle he can get his dick cut off for all i care about him cant wait till they send him to the us
nottheonion,not_removed,are the people buying those drugs not also indirectly responsible
nottheonion,not_removed,only indirectly as im sure youre aware otherwise you would have only mentioned the direct murders the dea has directly killed thousands of people yet they get the complete opposite treatment if people take away your freedom by force and then take your life when you disobey they are justified to defend themselves
nottheonion,not_removed,he is in the same boat as the heads of companies who sell unhealthy food while he sells an unethical product the consumers are just as much to blame where there are buyers there will always be sellers
nottheonion,not_removed,i never understand why people say this no i think being a drug lord means he sold a shit ton of drugs why would i find it acceptable to sell something but only if its a couple is it only okay for a company to sell only a couple beers or cigarettes the kids on reddit love to say this shit so that they can be both against and for legalization at the same time without any dissonance so you stop using critical thinking once you arrive at the belief system you want to believe in i just told you that i dont think selling prohibited drugs justifies incarceration and you respond with well its a lot with so much confidence as though you had just defeated my argument entirely even though im sure even you realize how stupid it is if you actually think about it you just dont want to because as i said youve already chosen what beliefs you want to believe in
nottheonion,not_removed,underrated comment
nottheonion,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiconjugalvisitmexico its a real thing over most of the world
nottheonion,not_removed,it was a fairly prominent topic in the show oz in particular
nottheonion,not_removed,you know what he meant just trying to fight sheeeeeeeeeeeeeiiiittt
nottheonion,not_removed,you could be a cast director
nottheonion,not_removed,because of the other that arent like him you dont reinstitute the death penalty for a single individual it sets a dangerous precedent and calls into question your reasoning for not having the death penalty in the first place
nottheonion,not_removed,and there will always be nightsticks
nottheonion,not_removed,one of the craziest things ive read lets take for instance him having the judge that was presiding over his case murdered shot in the back of the head in the middle of the day while jogging can you explain to me what kind of good act can be more good than that evil there is no making up for that or the countless others hes had murdered your comment would make family members of those hes killed weep
nottheonion,not_removed,source with statistics please
nottheonion,not_removed,lol
nottheonion,not_removed,dont be an idiot hes a drug lord the drug lord
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree while i dont plan on having kids myself most of the posts in that sub read like the atheist euphoria post that everyone including atheists makes fun of
nottheonion,not_removed,hilarious comment
nottheonion,not_removed,not nearly as bad as rrarepuppers
nottheonion,not_removed,really you should checkout rnews nothing tops the amount of pathetic censorship than that place
nottheonion,not_removed,i for one appreciate that someone is doing something about the overpopulation that doesnt involve culling
nottheonion,not_removed,because last time i checked while very stress relieving its illegal to target and murder the obese
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean if youre gonna torture a man to death via inhumane treatment ie keeping him awake all night might as well put a bullet in his head and stop pretending incarceration is the more civil thing to do
nottheonion,not_removed,because it crosses over from punishment into torturerevenge territory
nottheonion,not_removed,if by if by unreasonable you mean completely logical you mean completely irrational then yes everytime one you people start a sentence like this im just going to jump on your confident egostroking shittrain for the ride d
nottheonion,not_removed,its not contrarian in the slightest perhaps people take issue with their government torturing people for fucks sake its a terrifying premise and your opinion about how bad a person he is means nothing
nottheonion,not_removed,i was about to upvote until i saw the trumpist name calling him a war lord while crawling up putins ass
nottheonion,not_removed,everyone deserves another second chance you freak
nottheonion,not_removed,you cant cage things up and then act surprised when they do not like it
nottheonion,not_removed,it can mess with your head that and being in prison will definitely make it worse
nottheonion,not_removed,in a hospital you are woken every hours for vitals its not torture especially when you can sleep as much as you want between the wakings shit i get up twice a night to pee its not torture
nottheonion,not_removed,cia run is running school of americas torture program yes please downvote me for saying once again there is antiintellectualism issue in the us
nottheonion,not_removed,um wrong on all accounts im not feeling guilty about something i had zero say in and we definitely used techniques like that as a part of the program we certainly used worse as well but sleep deprivation is a brutal brutal thing when it never ends
nottheonion,not_removed,you just need a legitimate war and not a slogan designed to militarise police and oppress your own people ghen and youre golden
nottheonion,not_removed,fuck off i said this yesterday for the first time in years lmao
nottheonion,not_removed,even if you were to initially only use it against him it would set a dangerous precedent
nottheonion,not_removed,it means the c is next to the v on the keyboard
nottheonion,not_removed,no being mentally ill leads to self injury and suicide
nottheonion,not_removed,eh we do better than
nottheonion,not_removed,me for sure
nottheonion,not_removed,on a positive note brothers and sisters my wifes new medicine is supposed to make her crave sex as one of side effects
nottheonion,not_removed,speak for yourself buddy
nottheonion,not_removed,kinda proves his point though
nottheonion,not_removed,sorry to hear that bud what i was saying is that the dude you were replying to was being sarcastic about feeling bad for him we all know hes earned everything he has coming to him
nottheonion,not_removed,its not the product he is talking about its the hits put on peoples lives
nottheonion,not_removed,he has shot people himself he is not only indirectly responsible for peoples deaths read about him
nottheonion,not_removed,you got it way wrong drug lord is pretty far beyond selling drugs whether its grams or tons this guy is personally responsible for the murders of quite a lot of people you misunderstood me to be talking about the amount of drugs he sells i dont give a shit about that hell ive sold drugs before but when you get your hands literally bloodied with murder and human trafficking its something else entirely
nottheonion,not_removed,what
nottheonion,not_removed,the law needs to take into consideration extraordinarily dangerous individuals like him theres no reason to have a blanket law about death penalties that has to apply to everyone war criminals and people in charge of genocide like el chapo should be trialed under special circumstances
nottheonion,not_removed,he probably watched narcos
nottheonion,not_removed,says negative thing about subreddit gets downvoted to agrees with negative comment gets upvoted to profit
nottheonion,not_removed,people like having groups they can talk in its pathetic how much effort and energy is wasted throwing ire and ignorant bs at groups you dont care about and have literally no effect on your life
nottheonion,not_removed,thank you for showing me this subreddit
nottheonion,not_removed,oh its worse actually
nottheonion,not_removed,latest post in td who wouldve thought
nottheonion,not_removed,im child free as well but i dont get that sub its like ratheism yeah i might share some of the same views but i dont want to be lumped in with the crazy and obsessive
nottheonion,not_removed,overpopulation wont be solved in western countries all a decreasing birthrate would do in europe and the us is further disadvantage the economy while not having a significant impact on the growth of the worlds population
nottheonion,not_removed,i sleep with the lights on all the time its not even close to torture also who cares if he has to wake up every four hours for a brief minute role call are you truly so spoiled that you think a bullet to the head is a better alternative then these mild inconviences also for the record ive been to jail my bunk was directly under the fluorescent lighting and i would sleep beneath it during daylight hours just fine and would you believe the gaurds walk by ever hour or so and gives you a shake to make sure youre still alive also mandatory role call every six hours which means getting out of bed oh my god the cruelty s
nottheonion,not_removed,dude when i was in the hospital they woke me up every hours to take my vitals it sucked but it wasnt torture
nottheonion,not_removed,having lights on at night and being woken up every hours dont seem like much of a torture some people sleep hours in total in a day and he has the choice of continuously taking naps since he has nothing better to do other than probably planning to escape or manage his cartel in prison most people can sleep easily with lights on if they are tired edit ive only slept hours today im going to sleep another few hours later el chapo has the choice to do so too
nottheonion,not_removed,if sleeping with bright lights on and having to wake up frequently is considered torture then i could say the military tortured me every day for months
nottheonion,not_removed,he deserves no mercy let him suffer
nottheonion,not_removed,thats not torture and there are ways to help they can give him a sleep mask etc also waking hours may seem unreasonable until you realize he can sleep all day if he wants theyre doing this because the dude seems to escape every prison hes ever been in
nottheonion,not_removed,i take issue with you calling that torture he might be woken every hours but so are people in hospitals to take vital signs is that torture he can sleep all day between the wakings if he wants also he can have a sleep mask or cover his face the reason the lights are on and these other measures are in place is because his escapes from prison
nottheonion,not_removed,you do realize that he has successfully escaped custody these are necessary precautions just using some basic logic you think its a good idea for the guards to just turn off the lights say good night and not bother him for hours i mean damn their main objective is to ensure he doesnt escape again his comfort doesnt factor into it
nottheonion,not_removed,like i said its not fun but its categorically different from the sleepdeprivation brainwashing thing being referenced above plenty of people are in a situation where they have to get up during the night either they have a small bladder or a noisy truck comes by every day or they theyre a fantasy adventurer who has to take a watch or whatever some doctors even suggest its more natural and healthy to divide you sleep in half like that whether you buy that or not its certainly not the same thing as being woken every minutes not at all
nottheonion,not_removed,never seeing darkness is torture
nottheonion,not_removed,not learning it cough school of the americas cough
nottheonion,not_removed,i had a dentist who was exnavy in brazil shed tell my brother and i about the torture resistance classes while drilling on our teeth and all made me less likely to complain
nottheonion,not_removed,good ole sere
nottheonion,not_removed,no other country is guilty of torture north korea and eritrea sure are if thats your standard
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean it might as well be not like canada or any of the south american countries can do anything to the us regardless of the decisions its leadershipmilitary makes glorified vassal states
nottheonion,not_removed,a legitimate war iirc people dead sounds very much like war
nottheonion,not_removed,id be okay with setting it as the precedent for anyone else similar to him look up the crime scene photos of cartel murders
nottheonion,not_removed,which is why you have to keep the room lit and check on them every hour
nottheonion,not_removed,thats just one single hacker though
nottheonion,not_removed,just throwing the bar on the ground then huh
nottheonion,not_removed,thats not saying much
nottheonion,not_removed,not since got that new pet goat
nottheonion,not_removed,wait are we including giving ourself a hand as getting laid in that case i get laid a lot otherwise no im lonely
nottheonion,not_removed,me too thanks
nottheonion,not_removed,august git gud
nottheonion,not_removed,this guy fucks
nottheonion,not_removed,dont lie on the internet
nottheonion,not_removed,no just usually reddit leaps to the defence of drug use
nottheonion,not_removed,his guilt for murder there isnt even any charges against him for murder much less a conviction he was arrested on drug charges thats my point
nottheonion,not_removed,are you seriously defending the dea a group of people who create the groups that hack others to death with machetes who shoot other people to death with guns who terrorize and kill innocent children who lock people in holding cells for days without food and water and no im not defending anyone who murdered someone with a machete thats why i mentioned drug sales and not murder nice attempt at that strawman there though
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah the dea is beyond the murders of quite a lot of people too in fact the police are also behind the same murders as he is because prohibition is the reason the black market exists in the first place yet they get to be the ones on the outside of the cell so yeah its quite unfortunate that he should be the one on the inside of the cell for no apparent reason
nottheonion,not_removed,even if one were to implement such a imo very dangerous law it wouldnt apply here as retroactive laws are outlawed in most parts of the world for a reason
nottheonion,not_removed,people like al capone and freeway rick ross too doesnt mean they helped
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean this isnt really him being a good guy just being a smart guy if the public wants to protect you your chances of survival in terms of not getting capturedkilled goes way up take escobar for example
nottheonion,not_removed,people dont want to know anything about the kingpin they adore also being an assassin he says they dont want to have anything to do with the painful side
nottheonion,not_removed,with statistics
nottheonion,not_removed,checkmate athiests
nottheonion,not_removed,doesnt matter still a bunch of censoring asses over there donald trump supporter does not refute rnews censors i guess logic doesnt get into the heads of you liberals these days they dont just censor me or donald trump they censor any rhetoric that doesnt fit their agenda its part of the shitty marxist pc culture that i thought you guys were so much against
nottheonion,not_removed,wrong we wont solve it alone but neither will anyone else
nottheonion,not_removed,agreed if i had my way i would also blast justin beeber and william hung at all hours of the day just for him
nottheonion,not_removed,sleep deprivation isnt torture thanks for the info i had it all wrong all i needed was the anecdotes of a con to set me straight
nottheonion,not_removed,but what if you had to get up and walk down the hall every hours for the rest of your life guaranteeing youll never be well rested again until you die
nottheonion,not_removed,im in favour of the bullet in the brain option in his case but sleep deprivation will eventually permanently fuck up your brain
nottheonion,not_removed,such bullshit i would love to see you woken by guards every hours without any darkness
nottheonion,not_removed,sleep deprivation is only considered torture by the geneva convention
nottheonion,not_removed,httpsvanwinklescomweaponizingwakefulnessusingsleepdeprivationbecomestorture httpsenwikipediaorgwikisleepdeprivation httpwwwsleepdexorgbrainwashinghtm how long do you personally sleep would you be willing to cut the time i suspect hours in half to see how well you deal with hours of sleep lets say just for a week there is a big difference between being forced to do it and doing it voluntarily i mean with sex the entire issue is consent right to the point where a certain percentage of americans is so convinced that everybody in prison deserves to be raped and if you did not want to get raped you should not have committed the crime hell dont people who raise a baby seem to deal with it rather well i mean voluntary sleep deprivation man i thought the last bush area republicans who supported this kind of enhganced interrogation had slowly died out but apparently i was wrong tldr if you are not willing to do it to your soldiers dont do it to your prisoners
nottheonion,not_removed,going one night with hours is hardly what this guy is going through dont get me wrong he deserves it but you comparing a bad nights sleep to people purposely doing this to you in a jail cell for days is ridiculous
nottheonion,not_removed,again you make my point for me if were not even gonna pretend as a society that were not thugs why the pretense
nottheonion,not_removed,forgive me i didnt realize harassing prisoners until they crack from mental stress was a standard part of our protection from their psychic assault powers
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah fuck basic human rights am i right moron
nottheonion,not_removed,thats not justice just becuase he tortured people it doesnt make it right to torture him we would eventually become just as bad if we dished out arbitrary punishments like that
nottheonion,not_removed,no administering lifesaving checks obviously isnt torture it may be torturous but it isnt torture being deprived of darkness is id like to see a source on him getting a face mask i highly doubt he gets even those basics
nottheonion,not_removed,infrared lights and cameras that detect that light are a thing if you didnt know
nottheonion,not_removed,necessary precautions what on earth are you talking about if this had anything to do with security theyd install a camera keeping the lights on isnt going to prevent him from escaping its just gonna make their electric bill higher and give them some satisfaction as they watch him squirm
nottheonion,not_removed,yep its called segmented sleep theres quite a bit of research done into it and studies suggest that this was the way most people slept before industrialization hour sleep wake up for two and go to bed for another the greeks used the waking hours for lovemaking and thinking many writers and poets to work heres a good article on it
nottheonion,not_removed,but having lights on does mess with your circadian rythm melatonin and serotonin that alone would be enough to mess with ones head
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah but theyre not in a prison
nottheonion,not_removed,thats an incredibly ignorant view
nottheonion,not_removed,you americans have a real difficulty understanding the concept of war having started around of them since the end of if body count is all you need for a war what about all your dead blacks or all those who die denied healthcare
nottheonion,not_removed,but how do you define similar to him the precedent would probably be defined looser and looser with each use
nottheonion,not_removed,ufluffymunchkin
nottheonion,not_removed,nobody lies on the internet
nottheonion,not_removed,for no apparent reason youre thick as mud man
nottheonion,not_removed,rick ross got fucked by the cia bastards
nottheonion,not_removed,checkmate druish princess
nottheonion,not_removed,so the same as td
nottheonion,not_removed,dont start a comment with wrong period thats not how discussion works
nottheonion,not_removed,every hours isnt sleep deprivation
nottheonion,not_removed,this man is a mass murderer i think leaving the lights on might not be such an awful thing
nottheonion,not_removed,your should read about polyphasic sleep its not torture nor anything close to that
nottheonion,not_removed,that isnt sleep deprivation youre an idiot
nottheonion,not_removed,im sure any of the thousands of people hes had murdered would have jumped at the chance
nottheonion,not_removed,cause of my meds i get up every two hours to pee this is not torture
nottheonion,not_removed,the bullet is kinda redundant then
nottheonion,not_removed,ehh dont kill a bunch of people sell tons of drugs and run a massive criminal organisation and you wont have to worry about it zero sympathy for the guy
nottheonion,not_removed,sure his situation is bad but he basically brought it upon himself by constantly trying to escape my argument is that his condition is not as bad as people make it out to be and is perfectly liveable a lot of the world live in a lot shittier condition than him but you seem to care more about the well being of some horrible drug lord who inadvertently killed thousands of people if youre so passionate about other peoples well being maybe you should become a charity worker and donate all your money to a charity otherwise cut your bullshit
nottheonion,not_removed,what are you acting like thats not possible i sleep with the lights on constantly also ive been to jail i was bunked directly under the flourescent light and slept just fine during the daylight hours guard comes by every hour gives you a shake till you respond then moves on every six hours mandatory role call which means everyone is out of bed and on their feet while they check to see youre still around was it mildy annoying sure was it torture not even close besides thats just the price you pay in a maximum security facility if you honestly believe it isnt possible or even challenging to sleep with the lights on and get woken up every four hours then theres probably a lot that you cant do protip theres not a lot to do in jail and you run out of things to entertain you pretty quickly theres no shortage of time to sleep and being woken up every four hours for a minute roll call isnt much of a hurdle
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a cruel punishment for a petty theif not a cartel leader and two time prison escapee btw ive spent a week in solitary in a county jail lights on it sucks but its not torture
nottheonion,not_removed,i sleep every night on a couch with the tv and lights on im woken up around when my roommate gets home every night its not fucking traumatic and its not hard to do my god you guys must go apeshit if your pillow isnt quite right
nottheonion,not_removed,literally anyone whos ever gone through bootcamp has done this for weeks on end its actually not that hard
nottheonion,not_removed,the geneva convention only covers prisoners of war
nottheonion,not_removed,being woken up once in the middle of a sleep or twice in a sleep hardly constitutes sleep deprivation
nottheonion,not_removed,hes only being waken up every hours it doesnt mean he can only sleep hours a day read the context properly
nottheonion,not_removed,this man is garbage the atrocities hes perpetrated on the people of mexico are numerous and horrific so i have little sympathy for your point of view the guy isnt a soldier hes not a prisoner of war hes a psychopathic scumbag that should have been shot out of hand also its bushera republicans not that i am one im actually really liberal but theres a point when sympathy has to stop would you have demanded they keep the lights off in hitlers cell or pol pots and yes this man is on the same level they were if given the chance he would murder millions
nottheonion,not_removed,except soldiers are sleep deprived as fuck in training cycles you get like hours of sleep a day
nottheonion,not_removed,do you know what el chapo and his thugs have done to people
nottheonion,not_removed,there is no pretense just because theyre not coming out and announcing that they are torturing him and give the public the scheduled viewing times doesnt mean theyre trying to hide it
nottheonion,not_removed,karmaits hard to feel bad
nottheonion,not_removed,you didnt realize that
nottheonion,not_removed,his rights arent being infringed the prison is taking nessecary precautions to keep a two time escapee locked up he deserves a lot worse
nottheonion,not_removed,its not arbitrary hes a two time escapee its a nessecary precaution to keep him in prison
nottheonion,not_removed,killing him isnt very moral either
nottheonion,not_removed,look at the other comments from dozens of users saying they spent time in jail and the lights dont turn off definitely not torture i personally sleep with the lights on its not torture i know we do fucked up shit to people in prisons but forcing roll calls every hours isnt one of those things
nottheonion,not_removed,yes because im sure their prison just has all kind of fun gadgets laying around for them to use in order to help with a prisoners comforts
nottheonion,not_removed,uuhh you realize he could disable a camera you think this is some newage brilliant idea when in reality prisons have tried only to have the cameras disabled especially in a cell where he could easily reach and disable but hey i like your forwardthinking
nottheonion,not_removed,actually thats all pseudoscientific bullshit and so is the idea that its how we used to sleep
nottheonion,not_removed,now expose yourself to the situation whereby you have to rely on that method to get any respite from the glaring unnatural light of a prison cell and see how easy it is
nottheonion,not_removed,how does that matter
nottheonion,not_removed,who are you talking to
nottheonion,not_removed,and i was pointing out that it shouldnt youre really invested in this arent you
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah strawman like a strawman fallacy look it up
nottheonion,not_removed,no im not that was a great explanation and a great comparison that you know you cant refute i know you want to cling to the beliefs and comforts that youre indoctrinated with we all do drugs are bad cops are good guys politicians are smart i get it so call me heartless or immoral or unamerican the one thing you dont get to call me is dumb for having actually thought about this objectively
nottheonion,not_removed,source with statistics please
nottheonion,not_removed,he brought it on himself when he decided to keep rolling everyone
nottheonion,not_removed,im just here to tell you that i think youre wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,oh right yeah its every hours
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah doing horrible things to horrible people sure makes us better than them
nottheonion,not_removed,yes it is without a doubt
nottheonion,not_removed,yes it is achievement of specific sleep stages are needed by the brain waking people up prevents them from achieving these states sorry but you only think im an idiot because youre ignorant of the facts
nottheonion,not_removed,idk ive experienced sleep deprivation used as torture before and its pretty miserable getting up to pee is different from getting up and have to deal with some bureaucratic bullshit
nottheonion,not_removed,if they were waking him up every hours to waterboard him then i would have an issue with it as it stands it is a very reasonable thing to do
nottheonion,not_removed,he did bad things therefore literally any violation of his human rights is justified
nottheonion,not_removed,no one is saying he doesnt deserve it hes saying that people doing it to you for a week is different than one night with hours of sleep
nottheonion,not_removed,but he basically brought it upon himself by constantly trying to escape thats some cartelish logic right there you brought this on yourself by selling on my territory
nottheonion,not_removed,i sleep with my lightstv on every night never have a problem my roomate gets home at and usually wakes me up again not that big of a deal how sheltered is somebodys life that they literally are arguing you cant sleep with lights on
nottheonion,not_removed,cartellivesmatter
nottheonion,not_removed,again no one is saying chapo doesnt deserve it the guy was just pointing out how stupid it is to compare one night with hours to days or weeks of it
nottheonion,not_removed,simple thing the only thing that we have is what distinguishes us from him hell i dont demand you understand my point of view in which an atf three letter agent per week of the war on drugs should be incarcerated in a mexican jail for the cooperation between the forces of drugs and the cartells that is morally indefensible i dont demand that you immediatelly follow my logic and treat others better then yourself i simply very poliutely suggest one thing how you are as a moral person does is not reflected in how you are to your friends but how you are to the lowest of your enemies and even more on those who rely on you if you can not stop yourself and afford them the luxury of humane treatment what better word for this then complete and utter moral bankruptcy as far as guilt what he is goes i would be carefull there as a wiser men then me who went through the horrors of and the somme offensive once said many that live deserve death and some that die deserve life can you give it to them then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement for even the very wise cannot see all ends
nottheonion,not_removed,since when does the training last for a lifetime
nottheonion,not_removed,so if the society does it to everyone were better off care to walk me through how exactly
nottheonion,not_removed,did you know what the us has done to people by criminalizing drugs coincidently controlling them they made the drugs cheapest ever and increased supply
nottheonion,not_removed,nice try rnc shill
nottheonion,not_removed,so its not about protecting us but its about revenge and now we swing right back to the beginning of the conversation where since our system is not trying to be more humane then we should just save money and swiss his head cheese for him cheap quick everyone gets their thirst slaked dont get me wrong hes a bastard and he needs to be destroyed but i believe that we need to destroy his profession legalize drugs and prostitution pay a decent wage to police forces and have internal affairs work from outside the precinct and really audit police and have good social safety nets so that people can have options besides crime just shooting him and his people isnt working hydra and all that
nottheonion,not_removed,i hope you realize that if karma exists youre amassing negative karma
nottheonion,not_removed,how does him being woken up constantly necessary are you aware that a camera can actually see a person when hes asleep what hes done before he was caught doesnt mean that he can be stripped of basic human rights that would make the state ass bad as he is im sure thats not what the state aims to do im sure youre not dumb enough to not understand that on an intellectual level its just that youre childishly letting your emotions get the better of your reason
nottheonion,not_removed,im referring to him saying that he deserves to be left in a room with the families of the victims and tortured in the comment i replied to not the current precautions which i believe to be fine
nottheonion,not_removed,it most certainly is torture the anecdotes of convicts doesnt trump the medical evidence
nottheonion,not_removed,oh im sure that they have already invested a lot of manpower into his imprisonment a security camera would be cheap and easy to implement mexico is not some kind of remote dirt poor country it borders the us
nottheonion,not_removed,if he reaches and disables a camera then we hire guys to watch said cameras and they inform the guards in the hall this is beyond simple how inept are you
nottheonion,not_removed,the comment you have posted isnt talking about two four hour blocks of sleep at night it is talking about naps evenly distributed across the day its literally right there in the comment if you had read it
nottheonion,not_removed,i cant say if youre right or wrong but dude he posted a bbc article and you came back with a sourceless reddit comment k
nottheonion,not_removed,vegetables
nottheonion,not_removed,no you didnt youre literally suggesting that they shouldnt put a murderer in prison youre thick as mud
nottheonion,not_removed,httpsanjivbcomsitearchivecrimerickyrossindexphp
nottheonion,not_removed,what do you mean
nottheonion,not_removed,seriously how does keeping the lights on and making him answer roll call every four hours qualify as being horrible
nottheonion,not_removed,no i think youre an idiot because you are one and your comments and responses reveal you as such a complete sleep cycle consisting of the stages you mentioned last roughly an hour and a half at which point you begin a new one i doubt you knew that though youre just bent on being as wrong as possible lights arent torture and neither is being woken up for brief moments of time and then being allowed to return to sleep
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah but its literally talking about getting up once in an hour sleep for roll call this sounds reasonable and having to get up one time during the night wont throw somebody into a frenzy
nottheonion,not_removed,being forced to wake up every four hours for a roll call isnt a human right if he was being tortured youd have an argument but as far as we can see hes being treated perfectly well considering the crimes he has committed
nottheonion,not_removed,didnt say it was justified just that i dont feel bad about it
nottheonion,not_removed,hell you get treated far far worse in a jap prison those people make death camp guards look downright humanitarian
nottheonion,not_removed,that is how it works on reddit
nottheonion,not_removed,its the same logic as you are now in prison because you have committed a crime everybody has to take the consequences of their actions i dont get your point wtf is cartelish logic anyway
nottheonion,not_removed,keeping someone in a room with the lights on screws with hormone production in this case im specifically talking about melatonin theres a number of conditions and mental illness that can be brought on by a lack of it how on earth did you not learn this in school or perhaps thats why you have a room mate
nottheonion,not_removed,the somme offensive was in wwi but i digress animals like this deserve no succor no respite from punishment they are simple beasts when you kill as many as hes killed for no other real reason other than he could normal human kindness no longer applies im not saying he should be waterboarded or beaten or turned over to his victims relatives or anything of that nature but then again not allowing him to sleep maybe two hours out of twentyfour and keeping him in solitary and allowing him two hours of sex a week is really no hardship especially in light of all the horror and misery he has caused and the fact he has escaped custody twice but people like him who have abandoned any lastshred of humanity are beyond redemption and should be afforded no sympathy if he were a drug dealer or even a guy who killed a couple of people i would agree that his treatment is way too excessive but hes beyond that he is evil incarnate and should be treated as such just as adolph hitler in should have been dragged out of the munich city limits after his trial and shot like the dog he was this garbage bag masquerading as a human being should be tried and his lifeless body dumped in the nearest landfill the next day in my opinion this man has by his actions denied he is human and should not be treated as such
nottheonion,not_removed,since when cant he go back to sleep immediately afterwards
nottheonion,not_removed,when did i say society should do anything to everyone
nottheonion,not_removed,im not talking about the drugs personally im against the idiocy of the drug war im talking about the vicious horrifying murders el chapo and his ilk are responsible for when you see enough liveleak footage or readhear about the inhumanity this man and his people have wrought its pretty hard to feel like hes even suffering enough much less suffering too much he is not a misunderstood man he is not just a number cruncher he isnt guilty of simple black market trading chapo and his men have murdered hundreds if not thousands of innocent people in gruesome ways there is no rehabilitation or fixing a person like this
nottheonion,not_removed,youre right leaving the lights on all night and waking a two time escapee up every hours is the literally equal to the things that el chapo did
nottheonion,not_removed,nope not at all im responsible for my actions not his
nottheonion,not_removed,do you think the camera covers every angle do you think that the camera cant be tampered with what if the guards did a check saw a sleeping man with his face covered or facing the wall in each of these cases he could have a hour head start minimum if he was allowed hours of uninterrupted sleep not to mention i dont think anyone has a basic right to hours of uninterrupted sleep he could sleep for hours a day assuming each wake up takes minutes this isnt some run of the mill small time drug dealer its el chapo that being said if they blared music in his cell hours a day and only allowed him to sleep for hours than that would be a violation of his rights you should know that even in county jails where people are serving time for misdemeanors they dont turn all of the lights out new guys and gals tend to have to sleep directly under a light that is active for hours a day i find it hard to get upset that one of the most notorious criminals of the day and two time escapee gets treated slightly worse than someone who got a dwi jail require at least some form of punitive element and this is about as light of a punishment as you could expect if his only crimes were the escapes and not the thousands of murders
nottheonion,not_removed,but is there a need to torture him keep him imprisoned without torturing him
nottheonion,not_removed,any other way you propose we simply perform a wellness check on prisoners efficiently because these practices get put in place after people escape and we need to change processes to stop it from happening again this isnt just to be mean i will again say that tons of people sleep with lights on and dont have a psychotic break
nottheonion,not_removed,first off i wasnt in anyway implying mexico was some shithole dirt poor country secondly you answered your own question if mexico is paying millions of dollars employing around the clock manpower why in the hell would they invest in additional unnecessary technology oh thats right because el chapo needs a good nights rest that makes complete sense
nottheonion,not_removed,how are these camera watchers seeing the camera in the dark
nottheonion,not_removed,think about how profoundly dumb this is and if you think im in inept just like every major prison complex in the world to see how just about everyone does not use this method to summarize your comment the prison officials should hire additional manpower buy additional equipment instead of just using the guards that are already on staff walk down his tier and look into his cell yea it makes complete sense the kicker your whole reasoning for doing this would is for el chapo to get a good night sleep while theyre at they should order a white noise machine serve him chamomile tea and put a memory foam mattress in his cell these things would also help and would probably be more costeffective than your solution
nottheonion,not_removed,its talking about segmented sleep split up into multiple phases its literally right there in the comment if you had read it
nottheonion,not_removed,sourceless reddit comment yeah because im sure some guy who writes for the bbc knows more about sleep than a neuroscientist whose specialisation is literally circadian rhythms
nottheonion,not_removed,not me im from england and my country has never done anything bad no sireeee
nottheonion,not_removed,in its history sure generations in the past but how does it matter
nottheonion,not_removed,we are talking about century not the dark ages mate oh what positives no im serious what positives do you see us has brought to the world in the last years
nottheonion,not_removed,ughhh this is why i told you to look it up strawman doesnt mean that it isnt what they do it doesnt mean a false statement
nottheonion,not_removed,hes not a murderer fuck head hes arrested for drug trafficking charges youre gonna have to do better than that youre up against someone smarter than you you might want to take your time and come up with an ethical or political point instead of simply hoping i dont notice that your justifying his arrest for something he wasnt even arrested for
nottheonion,not_removed,keeping someone in a room with the lights on screws with hormone production in this case im specifically talking about melatonin theres a number of conditions that can be brought on by a lack of it and im sure youll agree intentionally inflicting mental illness on someone is horrible if you need me to explain why waking someone up every hours is horrible thenwell lets just be glad youre not in a position of power
nottheonion,not_removed,nobody is stopping him from sleeping you dolt just a brief wake up and he can sleep again another four hours off and on for the entire day if he so chooses what about areas that are subjected to daylight for an entire half of the year youre just some pompous commenter on reddit who has read a little too much but didnt critically think about any of it in terms of how the natural world actually works my god the agony he must be in tell us more about the travesty and injustice of being able to sleep as many times as you want and having some lights on how about night shift workers who are inside during night with the lights on working and then come home to a bright sunny day youre being haughty for no reason like youre some crown prince of justice what other unspeakable torture methods happen in prison oh the inhumane food muffins and mandatory shower time and other personal considerations all of them are monstrous
nottheonion,not_removed,can you format your comment please i cant read a wall of text
nottheonion,not_removed,he tried
nottheonion,not_removed,goddammit you beat me to it
nottheonion,not_removed,has he admitted to makingacquiring a cake the story is pretty crazy a photo of a cake does not an apology cake make but if he did a for effort

nottheonion,not_removed,dude stole her tea that shits not cool man at least she wasnt shot shot though
nottheonion,not_removed,god this subs mods suck dick

nottheonion,not_removed,faux news
nottheonion,not_removed,might as well if youre antieu some of the same arguments apply joining north korea and unrecognized nations in un exile
nottheonion,not_removed,if its true good for them wish we would
nottheonion,not_removed,theres a doctor who episode that covered that
nottheonion,not_removed,faux news real noise
nottheonion,not_removed,thatll be fantastic for the global economy
nottheonion,not_removed,my right to live is being violated defendant ryan bundy wrote all of my first amendment rights are being violatedi am not allowed to see my brother and move aboutthis violates my freedom of assemblymy second amendment rights are being violated i never waived that right i guess he doesnt understand how jail works
nottheonion,not_removed,aww thats so terrible
nottheonion,not_removed,til there is not a lot of freedom in jail
nottheonion,not_removed,dude is seriously complaining that his second amendment rights are being violated while he is in jail awaiting trial apparently he did not waive those rights i say give him a gun with fake bullets and see what happens as soon as he goes off and tries to shoot someone he can be charged with attempted murder
nottheonion,not_removed,whats next single ply toilet paper instead of double ply soft
nottheonion,not_removed,i was searching the internet furiously for a headline from a legit source that referenced the best part of his complaint my rights are being violated he said my right to life is being violated all of my first amendment rights are being violated my right to freedom of religion is being violated my second amendment rights are being violated i never waived that right
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe its a good thing that someone with a unique platform is speaking out for prisoners rights even if for some reason he doesnt deserve them himself
nottheonion,not_removed,ill just leave these here and yes im aware that under other circumstances bundy would probably be arguing against internet for prisoners i find it fascinating that hes flipflopped and that the reddit hivemind has flipflopped as well
nottheonion,not_removed,see a lot of people here not giving him sympathy because he deserves the treatment dont forget theres a lot of people in jail getting the same treatment who dont deserve it not necessarily the right candidate to approach the subject with but quite a serious subject never the less
nottheonion,not_removed,woooowwww i mean right to fair trial and maybe he does legitimately need internet access for that but considering the massive concession he already got just by not being shot when he led an armed takeover of a government building maybe he ought to have a little perspective he has lawyers for a reason
nottheonion,not_removed,he has every right to the internet as long as he keeps it under his pillow or in his ass while at his local bed and breakfast known as jail
nottheonion,not_removed,its almost like its the medias job to slander militias and burn the constitution
nottheonion,not_removed,its a common complaint by sovereign citizens according to their own inaccurate interpretation of the constitution the government only has authority over you if you consent to them having authority for example if a cop arrests them they will say that they dont consent to being arrested then get all outraged when the officer goes ahead and does it anyway
nottheonion,not_removed,or more likely you dont even convicted prisoners have all constitutional rights as everyone else with the exceptions of being enslaved amendment and sort of voting amendment rights can only be limited as required by a compelling state interest this person has not been found guilty of any crime
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe he should be sent some gifts to cheer him up any ideas
nottheonion,not_removed,these cowards yes cowards for all bullies are cowards are whining about non existant rights to the intenet in jail these cowards havent been found guilty of any crime would you complain about non existent rights in jail aftre they took over land that belongs to the people of the us for their own personal puposes thereby violating every us citizens rights as of yet they have allegedly done that allegedly in violation of law where in the constitution does it say you have the right to the internet while incarcerated its called the first amendment congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances practicing a religion could conceivably require an internet connection clearly it abridges the freedom of speech of the press it limits the ability to assemble and to petition the government note the right to petition the government is curtailed specifically for prisoners as per richardson v ramirez in addition the amendment states in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation to be confronted with the witnesses against him to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence all of which could also be limited by the lack of internet they are being denied their right to pray with one another and have visiting time with each other really yes really
nottheonion,not_removed,he is also upset that he is not able to freely move about oh dear
nottheonion,not_removed,there was a museum exhibit a while back that showed improvised weapons from prisons the one i liked the most was a shiv made from melted down milk cartons you wouldnt think a milk carton as deadly but given ingenuity and time humans can do incredible things even if those incredible things are destructive so youre saying to give this clown of a functioning gun and of a functioning bullet im sure i could fashion a very good weapon with all that steel or threaten guards with a weapon that is deadly at distances and the guards dont know if its lethal or not or somehow get a bullet something maybe an inch long and a quarter inch thick or so into a prison where people get cell phones or larger objects smuggled in i hope this was a joke
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know if borderline domestic terrorist is a great person to get the word out ja ja
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty sure internet in a jail cell isnt a right
nottheonion,not_removed,the internet is a privilege not a right
nottheonion,not_removed,even if the internet is a human right prisoners awaiting trial are not entitled to many of their rights when did the reddit hivemind ever argue otherwise its not fascinating its basic criminal law
nottheonion,not_removed,have you ever tried to fit that many tubes in your ass the internet is a lot bigger than a watch
nottheonion,not_removed,kinda interested in how his obviously ridiculous request is equated to media slander of militias not saying it hasnt happened black panthers just trying to see what youre referring to here
nottheonion,not_removed,of course that darned media with their antimilitia bias is sweeping the amendment under the rug again the right of citizens of the united states to browse pornhub in their prison cell shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or any state by reason of attempting to start a violent revolution
nottheonion,not_removed,what
nottheonion,not_removed,you dont get internet access when in jail awaiting trial just because you think youre special
nottheonion,not_removed,you think they deserve the right to a firearm while in jail the internet is not a constitutionally protected right by the way
nottheonion,not_removed,awww youve never met the american criminal justice system have you i recommend you keep it that way
nottheonion,not_removed,as of yet they have allegedly done that allegedly in violation of law its not alleged they fucking obviously did it and were arrested for it
nottheonion,not_removed,its almost like he doesnt know what prison is for
nottheonion,not_removed,i implied that due to fake bullets the gun would not fire fine then disable the gun by shaving the hammer so it cant hit the primer holy crap serious guy it is rnottheonion not a serious thread at all check the butthurt at the door
nottheonion,not_removed,why is it not a violation of the first amendment protections of speech religion assembly and press prisoners have all the same rights as everyone else with the exception of being enslaved and sort of voting even if the state can limit rights as necessitating by compelling state interest so the question isnt whether it is a right but why is it not a right
nottheonion,not_removed,its a right when you have to use internet to get your court documents so its your right to get ready for a case more importantly when the whole fucking book of the federal code is thrown at you
nottheonion,not_removed,i like to see him fit it in his ass
nottheonion,not_removed,correct they should be permitted internet access due to being a right
nottheonion,not_removed,you think they deserve the right to a firearm while in jail that would be obviously contrary to the state interest of keeping them confined to be blunt its troubling that you needed to ask the internet is not a constitutionally protected right by the way nothing is a constitutionally protected right until and unless scotus rules it is thanks to the rather byzantine system in the us which does not grant liberties scotus has not ruled on the issue until it has done so your claim has as much merit as saying transgender people do not have a constitutionally protected right to use public bathrooms more to the point you conflate what is a constitutionally protected right and what should be a constitutionally protected right displaying a remarkable degree of sheep
nottheonion,not_removed,bubba dont forget to send bubba and a piece of soap
nottheonion,not_removed,its not alleged they fucking obviously did it and were arrested for it they have been found guilty of zero crimes how many have you been found guilty of
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree that constitutional law in the us is byzantine and often outright stupid however it is the constitution and its unlikely to significantly change anytime soon
nottheonion,not_removed,prison is for bad people not for people like him obviously
nottheonion,not_removed,you can sure as hell bet he wouldnt think others in jail should get those or any privileges prison isnt a vacation no tv no chairs no use of vowels
nottheonion,not_removed,really is it that obvious
nottheonion,not_removed,seriously inmates need internet in their cells from my very limited understanding they often have access when they are in community through corrlinks httpsenwikipediaorgwikicorrlinks yes its expensive probably overly so but our government contracts out these services and thats the way it is for now no one seems to care about how expensive the other inmate services are phone for example so why should internet be different i dont think it should be as expensive but they do have supposed access
nottheonion,not_removed,prisoners actually enjoy much fewer rights than everyone else most obviously their right to arms and to travel are completely restricted but many of their other rights including amendment rights are also very limited of course they do retain some rights such as their due process rights and other rights of the accused im not sure where youre getting the the exception of being enslaved and sort of voting thing from thats demonstrably false why do they even stay in jail if they have the right to travel around like everyone why dont they just bring their guns into jail and shoot the guards
nottheonion,not_removed,thats what lawyers are for they do the research if he chooses not to have a lawyer then its his choice its the same as if i petitioned to get out of jail to question witnesses nope you stay right there your lawyer will do that
nottheonion,not_removed,internet access isnt seen as a right in the us as it is in other countries
nottheonion,not_removed,youre the one claiming the amendment guarantees them access to the internet displaying a remarkable degree of sheep oh youre one of those people
nottheonion,not_removed,actually forget the lube
nottheonion,not_removed,how about powdered soap
nottheonion,not_removed,none because im not a degenerate inbred
nottheonion,not_removed,so how about a flag that says bang
nottheonion,not_removed,jon erik hexum the name may skew a bit too old for most readers of this forum but a tv star and model who was playing russian roulette with a gun with blanks he lost there was a wad of cotton or something to keep the powder from leaking out pressed to his temple it was a fatal load and yeah not sure why down voted
nottheonion,not_removed,inmates need internet in their cells seriously only those in need have rights from my very limited understanding they often have access when they are in community through corrlinks httpsenwikipediaorgwikicorrlinks corlinks is for email only yes its expensive probably overly so but our government contracts out these services and thats the way it is for now yes its expensive it costs per minute that many not sound like much but the average paid federal inmate makes an hour well above the state average not only is it overly expensive but it demonstrates that the cost for such a system prior to allowing corporations to turn the criminal justice system into a lucrative business opportunity is negligible indeed it is more expensive than providing simple internet since theres nothing to say that inmates would need to be provided with an internet enabled device only to be allowed one no one seems to care about how expensive the other inmate services are phone for example so why should internet be different its true that few care hence why im making some effort at pointing out that inmates have the same protection of rights as everyone else even when they havent been found guilty of a crime i dont think it should be as expensive but they do have supposed access no only is corrlinks only for email and only permitted during restricted times and place it is also monitored although it partially addresses free speech it does not address freedom of assembly free press or the various rights associated with a supposedly fair trial
nottheonion,not_removed,prisoners actually enjoy much fewer rights than everyone else agreed as per the amendment they can be enslaved and as per the amendment they can be denied the right to vote most obviously their right to arms and to travel are completely restricted but many of their other rights including amendment rights are also very limited no more so than for anyone else you have rights when and if the state fails to demonstrate a compelling interest to not allow the rights it has been successfully argued that permitting guns and freedom of movement would conflict with the states interest in confining people since you fail to even imply that the state has an interest in denying access to the internet it seems you agree inmates still have that right of course they do retain some rights such as their due process rights and other rights of the accused the right to due process and all other rights until demonstrated otherwise again with the exception of being enslaved and voting im not sure where youre getting the the exception of being enslaved and sort of voting thing from thats demonstrably false see above i highly recommend you read the constitution at some point it is an important document both legally and historically why do they even stay in jail if they have the right to travel around like everyone why dont they just bring their guns into jail and shoot the guards see above its troubling that you feel the need to question the conflict between the states interests and allowing prisoners guns and freedom of movement
nottheonion,not_removed,that isnt the law though if you want them to break their rights they will win the case i think they are dipshits but they deserve their rights
nottheonion,not_removed,as per a prior comment nothing is a constitutionally protected right until and unless scotus rules it is thanks to the rather byzantine system in the us which does not grant liberties scotus has not ruled on the issue until it has done so your claim has as much merit as saying transgender people do not have a right to use public bathrooms more to the point you conflate what is a right and what should be a right
nottheonion,not_removed,youre the one claiming the amendment guarantees them access to the internet the first amendment guarantees free speech to the extent that it does not conflict with a compelling state interest since you accept that the state has no compelling interest you agree that prisoners have a right to use the internet oh youre one of those people yes a free thinker
nottheonion,not_removed,ergo assuming you arent an inbred liar about never getting so much as a speeding ticket you have been found guilty of an equal number of crimes as ammon bundy
nottheonion,not_removed,what is a fake bullet if you are referring to rubber bullets those are also deadly
nottheonion,not_removed,there are some real fucking nut cases on this sub
nottheonion,not_removed,so they have the right to bear arms in prison but they dont get to because the state says so it seems we agree what they can and cannot do in prison but im not sure you know what a right is
nottheonion,not_removed,hunh the law states you have access to email text only for communication purposes ill make the assumption that this is not what you or the militia meant by internet most people equate internet with the web though some old geezers like me started with ftpspace and netnews so if theyre stopping them from email you have a point if theyre stopping them from reddit theres no statute requiring it ianal ianacorrectionsofficer please correct mistakes
nottheonion,not_removed,presumably he means something that looks like a bullet and fits in the gun but does nothing when you pull the trigger
nottheonion,not_removed,could do bullets with no primer all brass and lead but no bang at all
nottheonion,not_removed,so they have the right to bear arms in prison but they dont get to because the state says so exactly hence being rights rather than liberties it seems we agree what they can and cannot do in prison but im not sure you know what a right is see above the us uses a system that tries to give the impression of liberties when only granting rights rights are imposed selectively whereas liberties are limited selectively the constitution clearly does not limit the right to bear arms to those not in prison yet states limit the right based on state needs that suggests a liberty yet the government chooses whether the government has sufficient need to limit them resulting in rational fallacies in decisions like and that directly contradict so people have rights unless the states says so
nottheonion,not_removed,they have access to their case files right but the only way for them to get the files is on a ipad which needs internet to use app with all the case files on it i know why not have thousands and thousands of papers in their cell and not a ipad i might be missing a few details i havent slept
nottheonion,not_removed,a real cartridge with a dummy primer might actually be sufficient to fool him
nottheonion,not_removed,ipadtablet doesnt mean internet access you can store the docs ahead of time doing a manual sync when needed no radios no internet ipad in prison really hey violent offender heres a hunk of glass and metal that we totally trust you to not weaponize or otherwise fashion into tools you wouldnt short out the battery making a small explosion would you thats not even counting the charger cable yeah theres no way theyd get an ipad in a cell you make it sound like prisonners preipad were subject to cruel and unusual punishment yes they had papers back in the day youre saying poor dude hes stuck doing what prisonners in the late had to do yeah lack of sleep i have toddler twins i hear ya
nottheonion,not_removed,was looking for this answer you can tell just by looking at the ammunition what kind of round it is whether it be hollowpoint blank fmj etc
nottheonion,not_removed,well right now to my knowledge they still have their ipads during the day without the internet needed to use the app for court docs yes an ipad idk why not papers who knows its the century they want to save paper maybe i am not saying pre ipad they were subjected to nails to the scrotum or anything they right now have no case files

nottheonion,not_removed,and those member are not under investigation because they hide there corrution better poor brazil i hope that they pull through without too much trouble
nottheonion,not_removed,thankyou man this gives me hope
nottheonion,not_removed,accidentally shes looking right at him
nottheonion,not_removed,hope this is the only time a naked guy made her famous
nottheonion,not_removed,see this is what happens when we have gas boys at stations
nottheonion,not_removed,doesnt look accidental a coincidence perhaps but i dont see an accident
nottheonion,not_removed,am i the only one taking offense for her sharing this picture without the mans consent
nottheonion,not_removed,according to the local sub for the area this happened on or near a nude beach so seem like it might be pretty common to see a naked man there
nottheonion,not_removed,welcome to oregon
nottheonion,not_removed,thats totally not the same as everyone just so youre aware
nottheonion,not_removed,oh dad
nottheonion,not_removed,but why did he bring the dog
nottheonion,not_removed,so she posted pictures of this naked guy to the internet without any sort of consent
nottheonion,not_removed,twist naked mans viral rant about teenage girls showing up on his riverfront property and photographing each other in his swimming hole
nottheonion,not_removed,i foresee this poor guy getting arrested and having to register as a sex offender
nottheonion,not_removed,why dont you take a seat on that bank right over there
nottheonion,not_removed,exactly what i thought
nottheonion,not_removed,also this wasnt her senior pic it was just one of the shots from the photoshoot
nottheonion,not_removed,rcreepshots
nottheonion,not_removed,a you cant identify him from the picture and b hes out in public if he had any reasonable expectation of privacy than it would be a different story
nottheonion,not_removed,the guy chose to go out in public naked
nottheonion,not_removed,in eugene or its legal for adult women to walk around topless the nude beach youre speaking of is sauvie island spelling might not be right and half is clothing optional and the other half is clothing required if memory serves right
nottheonion,not_removed,because oregon
nottheonion,not_removed,you seem to be confused this is a man and one that is white and overweight too that means that making sport of him is totally cool he isnt a sympathetic victim because men arent the real victims
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah if this was reversedwell lets just say that we would not be reading about it on this sub
nottheonion,not_removed,you dont know much about oregon
nottheonion,not_removed,for river bathing welcome to the real world dude you dont need clothes to swim
nottheonion,not_removed,and it is not a look of disgust
nottheonion,not_removed,ofc going to a clothing optional beach is totally the same as having your picture shared over the internet with a million ppl
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know
nottheonion,not_removed,youre right sauvie island has a few beaches and one is clothing optional while the rest are family beaches
nottheonion,not_removed,in that case we should be asking why the dog brought him
nottheonion,not_removed,naked bike rides naked runs naked bathing naked nudity we have it all
nottheonion,not_removed,truth its definitely not a look of disgust
nottheonion,not_removed,she wants that dad bod dick
nottheonion,not_removed,is it a clothing optional beach or are you just making things up
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont think that was a clothing optional beach if you walked downtown naked you would get photographed and there would be no one else to blame that area looked a little more private so if they had shared a closeup of his face yeah i would have called them out on it this is all subjective anyways
nottheonion,not_removed,til theres more than one nude beach lol thanks for the clear up
nottheonion,not_removed,the only reason i even know of sauvie island is because some random gas station attendant invited me to go with him there i had to ask a friend where it was and well that seemingly innocent offer turned creepy real quick
nottheonion,not_removed,is was somewhere else in the remarks yes
nottheonion,not_removed,i live down the road from sauvie and i love that place holy crap the amount of fresh food you can pick for yourself there and the beaches so thats nice

nottheonion,not_removed,i remember years ago when i visited the usa that we got questioned heaps because we said we were plumbers because we actually are and that plumbers make pretty good money in australia the dude at customs was like how did you afford this trip i fix toilets for a living no how did you afford this trip i fix pipes mate he let us in after mins
nottheonion,not_removed,guy should send the interviewer a bill for time he spent good years of his life learning how to do what he does and deserves payment for services rendered
nottheonion,not_removed,plot twist they just needed to plug it in
nottheonion,not_removed,trump is smart he is questioning capable professionals for a reason when they try to leave the country they will be denied exit
nottheonion,not_removed,apparently our border patrol is qualified to deliver computer science tests and on a side note totally a symptom of a tech talent shortage s
nottheonion,not_removed,it is not odd to ask questions of similar caliber i watched a few episodes of the uk border documentary show and people claiming to be students were asked questions from the courses they had taken but the questions were of course not difficult enough to require the use of a pen some didnt even know what the definition of the course they clearly got an a or b was and were denied entry because obviously they had lied on their applications to get student visas
nottheonion,not_removed,do other countries do this i have traveled internationally a fair amount only to northcentralsouth american and european countries though and the only questions ive been asked at immigration are where im from where im going and for what reason sometimes theres some other questions but its generally just mild chitchat stuff
nottheonion,not_removed,this is apparently a thing now i wont be answering any questions without a paid invoice
nottheonion,not_removed,if customs has suspicions that smugglers etc are claiming one profession they start asking questions only that profession would know a friend whos a catholic priest and would travel from the us to canada monthly got stopped a few months in a row by canadian customs and asked catholic theology questions that were easy for him but a guy dressing as a priest as a cover wont know after the second time he asked and they told him they had strong suspicions some drug smugglers were dressing up as priests i suspect he reason he got quizzed is similar
nottheonion,not_removed,im a chef and supposed to visit in august wonder what i will be asked to so
nottheonion,not_removed,how is this oniony every country has people who ask these questions to verify their type of employment the cbp agent probably typed computer science into his system and it spit out a few questions to ask the guy to verify his profession
nottheonion,not_removed,good read would have been baffled as well and said yes now i know that ill ask if the guy can afford to pay me for the service will probably mean ill end up with a hand in my butt but worth it
nottheonion,not_removed,given what they focus on nowadays versus what they actually let slip through its quite obvious that theft sexual abuse and corporate espionage especially that last one are the primary goals of customs here
nottheonion,not_removed,they are doing this until everyone is ok with the general concept then hope for a bunch of strippers trying to pass through yes mam could you please demonstrate
nottheonion,not_removed,so what questions was he actually asked thats the only part of the article i was actually interested in
nottheonion,not_removed,further proof that whiteboard interviews are bullshit they are used by the cbp
nottheonion,not_removed,my first thought was that the tsa probably needed help with their computers and the it guy was sick then a random computer engineer crossed their path and went perfect
nottheonion,not_removed,bull shit
nottheonion,not_removed,good
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe he was reconsidering his own career choices since he wouldnt be able to afford a similar trip on a cbp salary
nottheonion,not_removed,plumbers make decent money here too not as good but if one actually managed their money theyd be able to fund that trip as can other trades that guy was just ignorant
nottheonion,not_removed,i just found out the bloke in my bjj class who drives an amg is a plumber
nottheonion,not_removed,but then he admits to working in the us without a work visa
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont think the article is saying that he actually did any services its saying that the cbp guy quizzed him on computer stuff seemingly to find out if he was actually a comp sci grad or something along those lines
nottheonion,not_removed,theyll still be illegal though so as to not have to pay them more than crumbs just like his companies have done with construction
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree
nottheonion,not_removed,youd be surprised how poorly some people plan these things like people who claim to be visiting as tourists but have no idea about where they want to go and most of their clothes are workwear like steel capped boots and high visibility clothing
nottheonion,not_removed,ive traveled quite a bit and in my experience the us has by far the nosiest border control of any that ive encountered
nottheonion,not_removed,i got stopped in france headed back home on leave from iraq where i worked as a contractor asked what i did and why i had no checked luggage had an apt in us and only min layover in atlanta for an international flight they then asked if i had any business cards to prove who i wasand as theyre not terribly common in war zones i provided the one from the guy who interviewed me that was it they were also questioning a couple headed back from vacation in egypt and let them through as well all told was about ten minutes while standing at the gate fwiw we were all white not sure if or how that affected anything
nottheonion,not_removed,some time ago when i lived in moscow i saw footage of russian police questioning detained african immigrants because they claimed they had degrees in mathematics they were asked sin and cos pi and some other trigonometry formulas but they couldnt answer although it kinda looked like they couldnt answer mostly because they didnt speak russian and couldnt understand the question
nottheonion,not_removed,interesting of course some people just arent very good at their jobs ive had coworkers with years of experience who didnt know things that they really ought to have been aware of heck my own work is sometimes so specialized that some of my general knowledge of my own field has faded
nottheonion,not_removed,the headline is funny to other software engineers because it sounds like they gave him a whiteboard coding interview which are already notoriously difficult and unnecessary
nottheonion,not_removed,cs problems are mathematical not about computer support
nottheonion,not_removed,yep the fact that this happens is indeed bullshit
nottheonion,not_removed,unlikely i had a similar issue in stansted airport years ago customs asked me where i worked and what did i do then proceeded to ask me weird questions about the industry i was in along with basic geography questions around where i worked
nottheonion,not_removed,missunderstood socially awkward cbp agent trying to get help with a project for his comp sci night classes
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like one of those guys who in the line at walgreens would go man tomorrow i have to got to a real job in a super condescending tone
nottheonion,not_removed,i have a bmw its the good life
nottheonion,not_removed,arent you effectivey in international waters until customs let you through
nottheonion,not_removed,doesnt matter if the information provided was used or not if hes sitting in a room solving software problems that is essentially identical to working
nottheonion,not_removed,from the article ive got a problem im trying to write a computer program can you help me which implies its a personal nonimmigrationrelated problem and really the interviewer should be paying for assistance but like another poster said billing him would essentially be admitting to working without a visa in the us so its fail either way still if my memory serves youre also not allowed to do volunteer work on a tourist visa either so i guess hes screwed either way
nottheonion,not_removed,yes its usually already obvious that they are not students when they ask the questions
nottheonion,not_removed,i have only been through israeli border control by myself once but the only way they could have been more thorough would be if they had taken apart my laptop which i am told they actually did to some math professor who was a bit short with them evidently this is not an isolated experience
nottheonion,not_removed,the whole idea of a whiteboard interview for any sort of engineringcomputing job is just silly oh i cant google stuff can i not google stuff on the job
nottheonion,not_removed,ive worked in the field for a near decade now and most of my relatives keep forgetting this
nottheonion,not_removed,even though they dont do shit
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty sure their job is to make sure people entering the country are actually who and what they claim to be then again so many people around here think borders are bad when the us does it
nottheonion,not_removed,not how border screening works nor employment law the fact that what youre doing looks like work is irrelevant to a nations right to enforce border controls and the fact that they cant monetize the benefits of such work means you cant sue for profiting off of your labor in whatever legal form you want to make the charge if your job is walmart greeter you cant send someone a bill every time you say hi to them if you moonlight as a prostitute you cant bill your boss for the office fling
nottheonion,not_removed,yup but the point is retail isnt a real job even though it is
nottheonion,not_removed,seems like a waste of taxpayer money to give people quizzes on their profession but some people are happy to throw that money away
nottheonion,not_removed,it was a facetious comment i did not honestly believe that border control would pay travelers for the time spent in questioning
nottheonion,not_removed,it doesnt get much more real fuck retail
nottheonion,not_removed,you were following up to someone who criticized the logic its a bit overdone to claim that was all part of an elaborate ohwhosinonthejoke at that point p
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty sure they were not making a serious proposal of payment either
nottheonion,not_removed,dr strangelove
nottheonion,not_removed,i wonder how commonlaw marriage laws would apply to someone whos already married and already living with their legally official spouse in the same house that triggered the commonlaw conditions a lot of people dont realize why those laws exist in the first place and seem to think that its purely western ethos made law what happens to the second wife when after years her husband is done with her what legal rights or options will she really have i guess women should just be content to be property s

nottheonion,not_removed,im super cereal guys
nottheonion,not_removed,i wonder why
nottheonion,not_removed,i disagree having a ranked voting system like australia and ireland would better reflect the will of the people and would increase turnout decrease negative adds vs positive and eliminate the spoiling effect of voting for a party i can see it having a huge positive effect on voter turnout we do not have the infrastructure money etc to support the faculties they would need for a majority vote plus voter fraud would explode there would be such an increase incentive to do fraud there would be recount after recount possible in every state because nothing would be settled anywhere until the entire nation was settled think florida a few elections ago nationwide plus with a majority vote we would have the same issue as this election hillary vs trump two horrible choices and people feeling like the are choosing the worst of two evils
nottheonion,not_removed,whos al gore
nottheonion,not_removed,one person one vote pretty straight forward concept who gives a rip if a state is large or small my vote in california is just as important as my vote in vermont where i chose to live is my business if i dont like the way things are going in my state then i move
nottheonion,not_removed,what does he propose instead or should california and new york decide everything for everyone we all know they are both shining beacons of society dont thumb me down im legitimately asking what you peopleal gore specifically replace it with or should states have next to no say collectively let alone individually
nottheonion,not_removed,i think the real issue here iswho the hell cares what al gore thinksabout anything
nottheonion,not_removed,no kidding ford
nottheonion,not_removed,yay and then urban smuggerites will destroy rural america
nottheonion,not_removed,personally the democracy we have now is a shadow of what it should be the electoral college is a sham they are in no way compelled to vote in accordance to the voters wishes when you have the uneducated masses voting you invite demagogues demagogues invite turmoil i feel in order to vote a person should be required to take classes paid for by the government which detail their responsibility as voters as well as attend conferences before the elections where they are made to read view and listen the many platforms which the chosen party representatives of all participating parties and how they would impact their lives these would be paid for by a group fund of the competing parties in these conferences materials would be about where the candidate stands on an issue there would be no references to other candidates inside any one candidates media but rather a strict adherence to the candidate in question elections should be restricted in their campaign contributions to a maximum amount of money a basic cap amount no contributuons from nonunited states citizens corporations lobbies etc if its not a person with an ssid its not allowed their campaigns should adhere to a strict guideline where misinformation leaves the candidates their lobbies and supporters held liable to stiff civil and criminal penalties i mean severe penalties involving jail time and multi million dollar fines for all involved im sure ill get a parade of downvotes for this stance but until we remove outside influences in elections negative campaigning and mass misinformation from elections well never be able to have a functional government when i voted this last month i found most people had not heard of other candidates many of these candidates would have better served them
nottheonion,not_removed,did he say this before or after he invented the internet
nottheonion,not_removed,he wasnt after his own election so its actually news
nottheonion,not_removed,for friggin real
nottheonion,not_removed,only the creator of the internet
nottheonion,not_removed,the guy who won the most votes in the election but lost the electoral college to george bush jr
nottheonion,not_removed,well thats suites their want and needs it really is an awful time to be a republican or democrat our parties are fucking stupid
nottheonion,not_removed,who is he op thats an assumption for sure but nonetheless on the topic superdelegates delegates are stupid too to count em up thats it why make it more complicated why assign a minority of decision makers to valuate the masss individual votes to is inherently and mathematically as equal as it gets editing with that process can only lead degraded equality
nottheonion,not_removed,wow different voting systems for a party and a country what a crazy idea
nottheonion,not_removed,the dnc is a private club the usa is a country if i give myself of the votes when my local chess club is picking its president who gives a crap but if of the votes were held by a single person in the us election people would not accept that
nottheonion,not_removed,people love making this claim regarding california and new york but lets do the math shall we using the census as the baseline the largest states are california texas and new york​ so lets say somehow these states landslide at to candidate a with a turnout of extremely unlikely someone can manage to win all of these at but lets go with it for now candidate a has million votes ec to candidate bs million votes ec the next largest states are won by candidate a at florida illinois pennsylvania ohio michigan​ candidate a adds million votes ec to candidate bs million votes ec many swing states here plausible that someone who won the biggest states by a large margin could win most of these the remaining states go to candidate b at candidate a adds million votes ec to candidate bs million votes ec extremely unlikely that someone who won the big along with a number of big swing states then cant convert any remaining state in total candidate a here earns million votes ec and candidate b earns million votes and ec so in this the almost impossible fantasy scenario candidate a still only barely wins of the popular vote and loses the ec which is exactly the kind of scenarios we are talking about that already occurred this year and in the year note too that this is being very generous to this scenario even a slightly more realistic scenario where texas goes to candidate b and georgia goes a instead completely nullifies this and we get something different in total candidate a here earns million votes ec and candidate b earns million votes and ec so under the slightly more realistic scenario where candidate a wins the largest states that are not texas because whoever wins california loses texas and vice versa typically he loses the pv and the ec but what if those big states were significantly larger isnt that the real concern well lets look at that lets pretend they have double the population and an according increase in ec votes california goes to million people and ec texas goes to million people and ec new york goes to million people and ec in this scenario we have a total of ec votes so each candidate needs to win the ec in total candidate a here earns million votes at ec million votes and ec from the top states alone and candidate b earns million votes and ec so in this case where its much more clear that the top states have the population to control the election the pv and ec actually returns the same result candidate a wins with more ec and a popular vote of which is fairly large margin the majority of presidents come into office having or less and about doesnt get to so really the ec doesnt actually do what people think it does in this context its basically almost exactly the same as pv even in extreme scenarios
nottheonion,not_removed,are you suggesting the conservatives in california and new york shouldnt even go vote because their vote is useless are you suggesting liberals in alabama shouldnt go vote because their vote is useless
nottheonion,not_removed,replace it with a popular vote the candidates got within million votes of each other if its based on a national popular vote turnout may increase because first past the post wont be a thing any more and people will know their vote counts even if its only a small part of the whole what we really should do is allocate electors based on fractional vote percentage in a state instead of a winner take all approach like we now have
nottheonion,not_removed,in the video he said he proposes a popular vote system where everybodys vote is worth the same no matter where you live
nottheonion,not_removed,you people just elected a guy who has spent the majority of his life in midtown manhattan but you decry new yorkers
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont think we should eliminate it but everybody should be represented in every state of california voted for trump he should get of their electoral college votes this is known as proportional voting electoral college makes every state worth visiting by counting smaller states up or a californians vote but because of winnertakeall awards it results only a couple swing states being priority targets hillary was the first nominee to visit texas in who knows how long shes a selfish deluded idiot yet the entire election came down people scattered across some swing states the reality is if hillary had been visiting the rust belt instead of texas the results probably wouldve been different this is how dangerous the swing state effect is hillary couldve easily won if shed listened to bill clinton or anyone about the election the next time somebody like hillary ends up in an election if they have an iota more of intelligence could happen given the dnc inner party being corrupt asshats they could absolutely win because of swing states democrats should be going to texas republicans should be listening to the people of california proportional seating of the electoral college would solve that it could overturn a popular vote but the campaigns would be radically better so it probably wouldnt matter as much
nottheonion,not_removed,the very first thing is to not have florida go for one party if its almost every election maybe their seats can go thatll kinda get it to parity with canada theres more to do after that to help parties but its a start by the way californians are worth less than a mid westerner for the senate in no system should someone be worth less than before we even propose making a californian worth more than
nottheonion,not_removed,there is a middle ground where california and new york dont have disproportionate voting power and that more accurately represents voters nationwide
nottheonion,not_removed,popular vote has a much more accurate representation of what the people want than the electoral collage ever will i live in nh whats good for the million here will never matter as much as the million in ny state and that million in nh isnt even united according to the polls it was nearly a split so lets pretend ny state was liberal like you seem to assume half of nh agreed with it so then it becomes million vs thousand people shouldnt determine the lives of million
nottheonion,not_removed,proportional representation ie every persons vote counts the same as anybody elses the way that actually makes sense also new york and california actually are shining beacons of society compared to the rest of your culturally backwards country
nottheonion,not_removed,i propose as i know many others do as well that we be a direct democracy with vote per citizen majority rules it shouldnt matter your state it should matter you are an american we all count the same
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a tad hyperbolic there there are just are blocks of states that always go red the state with the second most electoral votes is texas a red state and we dont have more then half the population living in just two states that lean a way you dont seem to like the system as it stands now is bad and gives way to much weight to just a hand full of swing states it almost always boils down to who wins fl oh and in this year is the only time in a really long time that it didnt turn out that way but its also one of times that the person that won the popular vote lost the electoral collageand they won the popular vote with the second highest vote total of all time but still lost the electoral collage even trump tweeted he was against the electoral collage during election night when obama was called the winner before all the votes where in
nottheonion,not_removed,you do realize that humans live there right like states dont deserve power based on the merit of existing frankly the mindset that someone in wyoming should have more voting power per person than someone in say michigan is nonsense vote per person majority rules its a very simple system anything else is just people from insert place thinking that theyre better than someone from insert other place
nottheonion,not_removed,literally most of the people who voted for president in the year
nottheonion,not_removed,but are your elite voters going to carry the full tax burden the last time we had taxation without representation shit did not go over well
nottheonion,not_removed,oh yeah that guy i forgot about him years ago
nottheonion,not_removed,yes it makes me really want a ranked voting system several countries are local governments have it so i can vote for who i actually feel represents me without the spoiler effect
nottheonion,not_removed,lol sure hope he wasnt assuming me i think he was referring to al gore
nottheonion,not_removed,no its total bullshit imagine this electorally its basically a tie its just down to little new hampshire candidate a is million votes up overall but candidate wins new hampshire by a single vote candidate b is the winner this is bull and entirely possible there is so much more wrong electoral votes are given by the amount of senators the amount of representatives in a state wyoming is so small it only has representative however it has senators so its not completely voiceless but in the electoral college it has a lot of extra power its still not a lot because so few people live there but its disproportionate in comparison to a state like california of course none of this matters for either state sadly because those states always go one way and there is no incentive for people to really vote there which is pathetic there is just so much wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,i am an outsider but holy shit the ec seems like the most stupid misunderstood and unnecessary system of voting
nottheonion,not_removed,the electorial college was created so each state had some balance in the power they have those states with huge population still have very notable power under the current system those people have reason to vote with confidence we are a group of states and that does have significance outside of just the individuals there are state wide constitutions and laws specifically for states we unified when we founded we did not become a glob
nottheonion,not_removed,no im suggesting the country as a wholes vote should be represented not just the most populated areas theres like other states bud
nottheonion,not_removed,if you looked at reddit during the election youd see that yes thats what a huge number of redditors think
nottheonion,not_removed,its completely up to the state how they cast their votes contact your congresswomen
nottheonion,not_removed,no i didnt im canadian
nottheonion,not_removed,thank you for a reasoned and detailed personally written out response i agree with a lot of what you say it seems everyone wants to scream for straight up popular vote since trump won i know the feeling we just had a rough election up here thats turning out for the worse one thing we have in common though is that the usa and canada are among the biggest countries in the world we have gigantic landmasses made up of all different cultures of people maybe the electoral college isnt perfect and maybe its outdated but i havnt yet heard any of the compainers come up with something better or more fair people dont realize the difference beteween equality and equity or between fair and equal i work as a night custodian in the local schools up here and the principal has hanging in her office
nottheonion,not_removed,i would be interested to see the vote count if all of the states followed new hampshire popular vote of the congressional district wins that vote senatorial votes go to the winner of the state popular vote
nottheonion,not_removed,no they were working with bad data public and inside polling was obviously showing those were safe
nottheonion,not_removed,sigh how is proportional voting in any way better than a popular vote theyre the same thing except popular vote does what youre hoping for but better
nottheonion,not_removed,thank you for an honest and practial answer maybe reforms need to be done but more people like you need to be proposing solutions rather then screaming to abolish the electoral college im just a canadian im not trying to be you guys president our election didnt go my way but i accept our embarrasement of a pm
nottheonion,not_removed,floridas not going to do that its not in its best interest and the votes belong to the state to cast as they wish the first thing is to encourage smaller states to split their votes and get it to spread
nottheonion,not_removed,then they should be proposing that rather then shunning the electoral college which is the best thing you guys have going im a canadian i have no real say other then i am envious of your electoral college
nottheonion,not_removed,new york and california have disproportionate voting power what does that even mean they should be penalized because more human beings live there if little states are mad they arent as important maybe they can attract people
nottheonion,not_removed,how would you make that work though like what math
nottheonion,not_removed,thats not direct democracy its just a popular vote
nottheonion,not_removed,the usa by constitution is not a democracy its a republic and for good reason
nottheonion,not_removed,if that means ca and ny voters vote strongly in the winning direction so be it imagine a without borders you might say im a dreamer but im not the only one
nottheonion,not_removed,not elite voters the classes are open to all and are free as a voter it is your responsibility to be informed if you choose to not take the classes and subsequently abstain that is your purgative the classes would be held locally in each county seat periodically once you have finished the classes you would receive the test similar to driving tests you would be able to retake the test in a similar manner as well simply head to a voter registration area and retake the test every eight to twelve years its entirely up to them to take the initiative to vote in the boston tea party event we were not given such an opportunity
nottheonion,not_removed,i like the idea but im not sure about practice how accurate is arrows impossibility theorem that turned me off to ranked choice voting
nottheonion,not_removed,oh i dont disagree that the ec is bullshit i am just saying that one of the primary reasons people give for having the ec is also bullshit
nottheonion,not_removed,and state lines matter more than citizens
nottheonion,not_removed,of those other states are not swing states and get shafted under the current system furthermore the shafting of the by the is mathematically impossible those two make up around a fifth of the population to use a nonpolitical example of why the doomsday scenario associated with ending the ec wont happen consider mcdonalds every state has one they were not required to open a mcdonalds in every state yet they did they want your dollars anywhere they can get them saturating manhattan with mcdonalds isnt a viable strategy because a person whos walked by mcdonalds on the way home from work isnt likely to stop at the it will work the same way with votes politicians want votes wherever they can get them when the marginal benefit of another rally in la drops below that of one in san antonio theyll go to san antonio which is in another populous state shafted by the current system
nottheonion,not_removed,no im suggesting the country as a wholes vote should be represented you mean each individual casting their votepopular vote yes
nottheonion,not_removed,so you think states should be represented not people
nottheonion,not_removed,to voting wouldnt inherently give more populace states more sway those typically blue states wouldnt have decided the or election either which by the way would have gone to gore and hillary had popular vote been the deciding factor those populous and typically blue states citizens combined with the blue voters around the country would have decided those elections for gore and hillary and thats the beauty its en todo if a party wins an election by popular vote it shouldnt matter what states their member come from much else what states make up the majority of its voting base what matters is that those voters are american that that national party has the majority opinion regarding who our national leader is
nottheonion,not_removed,yea but you literally toss out of the population every time you vote in swing states another thing is that candidates dont give two shits about small states even with the electoral college your argument is uninformed nothing else you can go back years and you see that the ec does absolutely nothing but force candidates to seduce different states if you dont believe me new york has million people in it thats about of the total population of the united states la about million chicago about million if you add the ten biggest cities together which you fear will control the votes for everyone you make it to about of the total population of america now you tell me how getting rid of the electoral college gives smaller states less power
nottheonion,not_removed,does that explain why youre so confused about how many people live in new york and california hint about of americans
nottheonion,not_removed,thank you for a reasoned and detailed response please try to pretend this is about balance when really youre thanking them for being as antileft as you are
nottheonion,not_removed,there are results comparing some methods
nottheonion,not_removed,right clinton chose to listen to the wrong sources
nottheonion,not_removed,no it is different for a number of reasons my reason is that proportional voting at the college is a gateway to proportional legislatures and proportional house reps the electoral college is designed such that small states get more electoral votes per capita this means that in the eyes of campaigning politicians prior to the data era politicians had incentive to travel to each state in the union and hear them out
nottheonion,not_removed,some already do
nottheonion,not_removed,im australian so im not envious of anyones voting system i also dont understand how someone could be envious of a voting system that gives power to someone with million less votes than the runnerup in the hundreds of thousands id understand that as the electoral collage doing its job million thats bullshit in my opinion
nottheonion,not_removed,im a canadian i have no real say other then i am envious of your electoral college so you want to run your country according to what the minority wants to do
nottheonion,not_removed,why envious
nottheonion,not_removed,yes i know youre in agreement with me i was talking about a hypothetical where california might have more voting power per person like wyoming
nottheonion,not_removed,make what work popular vote you dont need math you count
nottheonion,not_removed,ok my bad but regardless of terminology i still feel our election by popular vote makes the most sense
nottheonion,not_removed,no other republic on earth uses a system like this the whole we have an electoral college because we are a republic argument means nothing
nottheonion,not_removed,not every is going to be able to afford to take time off or travel to attend your conferences many people work multiple jobs and have no nights or weekends im all for an educated populace but you cant overly impede someones ability to participate
nottheonion,not_removed,no but population density and way of life do
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah the states make up our federal government if your state wants a proportional vote so delegates are given by percentages im sure you can push for that last time this happened with just a popular vote we there was a war a straight popular vote will never work in this country especially with an expanding federal government
nottheonion,not_removed,i reslly dont know what the best thing is im sure iof someone knew the best form of government there would never be any wars and complaining see the thing i see is its damn near impossible to control a landmass as big as the usa and canada the coasts and everything in between is vastly different every section is living a different lifestyle every section has different aspects that make up the nation as a whole you cant give representation to just the heavily populated areas everyone needs a say in your case your country is a collection of individual states each one agreed under certain termsthe constitution to join each other in a federationmaybe it would work if you guys had popular votes in each state then whoever wins the most states in total wins the election but its to big and varying of a landmass not to have a system that proportionalizes each state otherwise your federation will crumble
nottheonion,not_removed,people in states should be represented
nottheonion,not_removed,im not anti left im canadian and i vote ndp which is our most left party
nottheonion,not_removed,thank you id been looking everywhere for this election but its nice to know that it is coming
nottheonion,not_removed,yes it is different in that its still less accurate than a straight popular vote by instituting a popular vote you achieve what you want and every single vote matters if youre wondering why proportional isnt as precise its decently simple assume of a state want candidate x and the other want candidate y if the state has votes how are they alloted well candidate y has more so they get it in that case of the states residents are ignored
nottheonion,not_removed,exactly people are paying attention to ne nh contact your congressmen but dont count on fl to be anywhere near the front of the line
nottheonion,not_removed,because of population in each state every state has a different population density then each other the popular vote doesnt represent like of the country
nottheonion,not_removed,i want to run it in smaller sections then the current provinces and have each section have an equal an proportional say in national politics im also for expanded municipal and provincial rights the federal government doesnt need as much control over the people as it has
nottheonion,not_removed,because even people in small lesser represented states have a say in the politics of the nation as a whole
nottheonion,not_removed,proportional representation ya fucking idiot cant you read
nottheonion,not_removed,thats not quite the argument we have an electoral college because it was written into our constitution our constitution also makes us a democratic republic and not a democracy one did not by definition require the other and i dont think hes saying it did
nottheonion,not_removed,nationally mandated days for the conferences would be assigned conferences would take place at regular intervals in the year up to the event employers will be obligated to assign unpaid vacation days where the person is to go vote there are weeks in a year a biweekly conference with registered voters similar to jury duty who would be in advance assigned to attend the conferences voting should take a albiet small investment on the voters part there are years between elections for presidential to take the classes i dont believe it unreasonable to say they have enough time to attend them
nottheonion,not_removed,not really there are rural areas in new york and there are big cities in alabama
nottheonion,not_removed,so dense places with a way of life that you dont like shouldnt get as much of a say thats the biggest dog whistle ive ever seen haha
nottheonion,not_removed,you should learn to use sentences
nottheonion,not_removed,not according to you by your own admission
nottheonion,not_removed,theres also systems in place for dealing with a locked college that could make it better or worse than dealing with a normal plurality vote so suppose you have candidates a b and c a b get votes c gets ec votes the vote goes to the house of reps which is proportionally representatitive in theory but not practice under current law but ideally each state would allow c or cs voters to pick a second candidate if c didnt have a shot at winning this is completely constitutional in the existing framework but parties never get of the vote needed for ec seats so such laws havent been pursued so if cs voters favor a rather than b the electoral college with plurality has more state pathways to accommodate parties etc ross perot couldve been president if hed been awarded college seats proportionally so there are caveats where yes rounding errors will occur but i would argue the electoral college could still offer a more robust framework when the electoral college was made these kinds of scenarios were frequent because there were parties with notable voting power
nottheonion,not_removed,the popular vote doesnt represent like of the country what are you talking about the popular vote represents the people who voted more people wanted clinton elected the popular vote doesnt care about population density it cares about population what you are saying is that the popular vote doesnt represent of the countrys physical area this is a good thing because if i remember correctly land mass doesnt have a vote in the election i do know why youre trying to justify the system because it happens to help the candidate you like i have serious doubts as to whether youd like the system if democrats lived in rural areas disproportionately
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont think you understand popular vote or electoral collage
nottheonion,not_removed,every section doesnt deserve equal representation lets go to the logical extreme lets pretend the entire population of canada lives in british columbia except for guys who lives in quebec the other in ontario youre proposing those guys have an excessive amount of power simply because of an arbitrary boarder line thats dumb
nottheonion,not_removed,whole electors for wyoming with a population of people an elector california has with a population of thats people an elector wyoming has less people and more power per person why this system was set up to help slave states have power its an antiquated compromise and should be reformed to include everyone equally
nottheonion,not_removed,theyd have a say and itd count the same as a cotizen fom ca or ny for ex
nottheonion,not_removed,i know there are good arguments to make in favor of the electoral college im just saying that yelling we are a republic at any sign of criticism is a counterintuitive argument and that seems to be what people like to say instead of giving an intelligent argument
nottheonion,not_removed,its interesting but not viable
nottheonion,not_removed,no they should get as much say as the rural areas that feed them
nottheonion,not_removed,rural and urban areas are very different culturally and your opinions can easily be changed when everyone around you has a similar set of beliefs im a liberal in a very liberal high school a friend of mine wore an american flag shirt and a maga hat the day after the election she claimed to have been threatened that day and while i didnt believe her as soon as our class period ended we walked out and she got like dirty looks fortunately she can take it otherwise she wouldntve dressed like that obviously but someone who couldnt would be practically forced to change their ideology its shocking to me sometimes how people dont realize that local culture plays a huge role in their thoughts and opinions the electoral college while flawed in some ways was made for this exact reason the founding fathers wanted each state to have a reasonable amount of power and they didnt want huge cities that think the same way to decide the entire election
nottheonion,not_removed,sorry im a tradesman not a spellingsmith
nottheonion,not_removed,did you not read anything ive said this post it littered with my words none of them contradict what im saying and im yet to be accused of that except by you
nottheonion,not_removed,more people wanted clinton elected i get that argument but plenty of people in both parties dont vote when they know which way their state will swing so more people who voted wanted clinton elected but since those votes were cast within the framework of the electoral college the raw numbers carry less weight
nottheonion,not_removed,i think i do i also dont give a fuck what you think
nottheonion,not_removed,thats like comparing oranges and magical moon berries can you adjust that for the real world
nottheonion,not_removed,the usa is not a federally controlled nation it is a collection of independant states who agreed under contractthe constitution to form a federation
nottheonion,not_removed,its not about the slave states it was about getting the little new england states to agree to join they didnt want their voices drowned out by the larger southern states they also didnt want the southern slaves to count towards their population
nottheonion,not_removed,thats fair but i think the opposite is also true people yell this is not democracy as a reflex and well no its not and its not supposed to be rcommahorror
nottheonion,not_removed,if you consider the current course of things i find this a considerably better alternative if you add term limits to politicians were cooking im no number cruncher but such a system should be able to be accomplished for less than the average campaign funds spent by both party candidates i like to think of it as a government that invests in itself and a people who invests in the process
nottheonion,not_removed,so you think rural america should have an equal say as urban america even if far more people live in urban areas
nottheonion,not_removed,so basically you think land area is a more important factor in voting power than actual people voting sounds as though youre performing some mental gymnastics to justify an undemocratic system that would invariably benefit republicans
nottheonion,not_removed,people say the ec is made for this reason but how exactly does the ec help with this it just shifts the problem down from the national to the state level its not as though each state doesnt have their own rural vs urban divide
nottheonion,not_removed,dont worry about it you understand the electoral college better than most of reddit
nottheonion,not_removed,well i believe the point theyre making is that every state has its own mix of people who wish to vote on either side of the election for instance i live in a blue state said blue state did what blue states do and tried to get the liberal candidate elected that isnt the whole story though in my state i know of several conservative voters and saw tons of their signs in this scenario their votes were basically trash bear in mind the same can be said of any liberal votes in say texas where conservates always win essentially the only way for people to have equal power no matter where they live is to keep it from being a state issue and make it a person issue why should a state choose how much your vote is worth in the current system your vote either counts toward helping your candidate or does nothing because your state voted the opposite of what you did in a popular vote you could actually do something towards the election by voting even if youre the only vote for that candidate in your entire state you still matter because your vote can help them win
nottheonion,not_removed,sure you believe people deserve to have their voice heard unless they live in california or new york
nottheonion,not_removed,if people got out and voted more and we had an election holiday the winner wouldnt be decided based on the weight of their votes it shouldnt be counted by state anyways just raw numbers overall if you want to be represented then do your part in the process
nottheonion,not_removed,i also dont give a fuck what you think seems about in line with the rest of your electoral views
nottheonion,not_removed,so youre just ignorant because you believe you know what youre talking about thats always fun thats whats wrong with this country and people in general they think they know how shit works and are too fucking willfully ignorant to even attempt to learn more about it or see if theyre fucking wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,thats kind of the point of an extreme its the exact same problem if you ajust the populations around the many should always outweigh the few
nottheonion,not_removed,noone is disputing that that doesnt change our point that the system isnt exactly fair
nottheonion,not_removed,sure but two wrongs dont make a right if someone says something incorrect the solution is not to answer them by saying something meaningless
nottheonion,not_removed,yes
nottheonion,not_removed,ill gladly take the downwards arrows i stand by what i say i have too much karma anyways thank you though and good luck
nottheonion,not_removed,sorry im late to reply to you didnt see your comment until now im not american im just an outsider looking in but doesnt the electoral college form somewhat of a representational democracy maybe reforms are do to come to it but its what america was founded upon its hard if not impossible to make a perfect system because people are different and locations are different i think people should have an equal say in matters but the popular vote is the polar extreme opposite of that because highly concentrated populations would have final say in absolutely everything at the expense of the rural communities with small sparse populations that theythe big urban populated areas rely on for food and resources countries especially ones spread out on such massive landmasses as we are are composed of many types of people with very different lifestyles and needs which need to be measured and proportionalized so that the farmers or the mining or fishing or whatever commodity driven communities have a say vs the large densely populated suit and tie comsumer population which has more numbers and influence you need to proportionalize and balance the populations wants and needs otherwise certain demographics will be forced to revolt there needs to be some sort of juggling act im from a part of canada thats beyond rural its straight up remotecanada has a different political system then the us does but everyone i know feels under represented because we have problems up here in the middle of the biggest forest in the world that beurocrats from ottawa and toronto couldnt even imagine we also have a form of balancing similar in concept to the electoral college but way different its a long story but youtube might have a condensed video on how it works its not very good either but there needs to be a way to balance the rural and urban communities so that each are represented if you lean to far either way the other side has every right to be pissed off
nottheonion,not_removed,im not saying that i agree with their decision to sit it out im just saying you cant view the popular vote with the same credibility you would in an actual popular vote election
nottheonion,not_removed,im not even american dont go blaming your countries problems on us canadians
nottheonion,not_removed,just to clarify though democracy is incorrect republic is not meaningless but corrective and incomplete
nottheonion,not_removed,ah yes my favourite part of democracy those who live in an area with a low population density are far more important than those who live in an area with a concentrated population and their vote should therefore be considered with far greater relative weight
nottheonion,not_removed,so in effect you think that urban peoples votes should count less per vote than rural peoples
nottheonion,not_removed,but the smaller you cut the closer you come to pv anyway and the further you risk letting urban rule over rural anyway personally i think the urban vs rural argument for the ec doesnt actually make any sense it in no way actually helps the situation the best way to help the situation is to make sure everyones vote actually counts regardless of where you live
nottheonion,not_removed,well the thing of it is the states themselves have a decent amount of power and budget if one state favors a certain type of leader they can and do vote that leader in well ideally they would but i dont want to get into gerrymandering right now as for why the electoral college was implemented well that was a mixture of appeasement for the reasons you mentioned above and distrust that the average voter would be well informed enough to vote correctly in their defence the literacy rate back then was abysmal compared to todays as was their information distribution that doesnt excuse another idea they had that was shot down where only land owners would have had the vote i digress though the point im trying to make is that the president affects all of the citizens and the things it doesnt are affected by states if a more rural state wanted to adopt policy x and it wasnt explicitly a federal thing it rarely is and even if it is states can and do have the power to go against it the problem with the electoral college is that while it does allow for less populated states to have more of a say it disenfranchises all of the actual human beings who vote a different way from their state thats millions of people every years who start to grow apathetic to voting because as americans a lot of us feel that my vote doesnt matter
nottheonion,not_removed,youre whats wrong with canada
nottheonion,not_removed,were not a democracy were a constitutional republic
nottheonion,not_removed,i think equally as important or do you disagree
nottheonion,not_removed,no counting rural votes as more important than urban votes which is exactly what youre saying is by definition not equal equal importance means vote vote
nottheonion,not_removed,thats not equality though thats giving rural areas way more power your saying the vote of some guy in wyoming should be worth way more than dozens in california thats the exact opposite of equality

nottheonion,not_removed,id agree with that i cant see anything in the quoted policy that covers displaying a flag the only excuse i can see for complaining under that section would be if they thought the flag was being stored or hung out to dry
nottheonion,not_removed,why

nottheonion,not_removed,rnottheonion moderators grapple with whether freedom of speech covers reddit threads
nottheonion,not_removed,i grew up southern baptist and this topic came up at a youth camp when i was younger the pastors wife said freedom of religion means you are allowed to worship jesus however you want for some reason this excluded mormons as well
nottheonion,not_removed,the presumptive gop nominee said if hes elected people are going to say merry christmas again everyone knows how no one has said merry christmas out loud since it was banned in late
nottheonion,not_removed,what kind of music do you usually have here oh we got both kinds we got country and western
nottheonion,not_removed,pastor john wofford of armorel baptist church in northeast arkansas raised that question at a national meeting of southern baptists this month i would like to know how in the world someone within the southern baptist convention can support the defending of rights for muslims to construct mosques in the united states when these people threaten our very way of existence as christians and americans wofford said they are murdering christians beheading christians imprisoning christians all over the world wow so the answer is screw freedom of religion
nottheonion,not_removed,living in the south its kinda funny to me that theyd get all pissed off about people building mosques down here you can drive past churches on a mile road cantt find a gas station to save my life in some towns but i can find jesus in just about every other structure i pass
nottheonion,not_removed,the irony is that this sort of thinking is why the mormons are nervous about trump as a historically persecuted minority religion which is viewed with suspicion by many they think theyre next though in all fairness they did murder a bunch of settlers and try to take over a town back in the day
nottheonion,not_removed,not directly related to this but when hanging out in pro gun forums i found it funny how one day theyd all be jerking off to the constitution and the next theyd hate on the separation of church and state or freedom of religion that involves actual freedom for people who arent them
nottheonion,not_removed,fun fact mary the mother of jesus is mentioned more times in the quaran than in the entirety of the new testament
nottheonion,not_removed,christianity is the only true faith and people must choose it freely wow
nottheonion,not_removed,ask a conservative christian about sharia law and they will bust a blood vessel in their eye while simultaneously telling you how our laws should mimic their religious views
nottheonion,not_removed,what hypocrites when a christian bombs a abortion clinic other christians say he wasnt a true christian but they dont do the same to other religions they label the whole group as bad as the worst one they see
nottheonion,not_removed,conservative christians have absolutely no interest in religious freedom they want a conservative christian theocracy but they know they cannot have that so they try to hide behind legalisms like religious freedom
nottheonion,not_removed,this sounds stupid but anyone who listens to the evangelicals could have told you that this has always been a thing many people have this crazy notion that not all people were created equal all affluent straight white christian people were created equal or some variation thereof
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,ive found that the right loves to tout freedom and liberty until they disagree with the way that you use that freedom and liberty then they turn into facists
nottheonion,not_removed,for what its worth the preacher quoted at the beginning of the article is from armorel arkansas armorel is a town of roughly people in the shithole known as mississippi county no one is going to build a mosque there because no one wants to build anything there the guy has nothing to fear
nottheonion,not_removed,religious useitwhenwewantandadjustit tosuitourneeds freedom for everybody s
nottheonion,not_removed,religious freedom for me but not for thee
nottheonion,not_removed,nah bitch this is a package deal you either get it with the stuff you dont want or you dont get it at all you cant discriminately cherry pick
nottheonion,not_removed,as a christian with generally conservative political views these type of people really frustrate me its like they dont understand how god wants us to treat others or how separation of church and state actually works seriously if some of you as nonchristians are troubled by these people imagine how we feel to us theyre not just spouting dangerous rhetoric theyre helping spread the idea that christianity is a religion about hate instead of love
nottheonion,not_removed,this is a genuinely oniony headline
nottheonion,not_removed,it all goes back to us vs them
nottheonion,not_removed,my idea is simple you can do anything you want as long as it doesnt violate any law no special treatment no special laws holidays need to be acknowledged and muslims work on christian holidays and vise versa unless they apply to both build your freaking mosques but if your yellers are too loud and people complain that they work night shift and cant sleep because of them you shut your face hole same with church bells they serve no significant practical purpose anymore i think we as a society should be beyond religion by now do whatever you want with it but all within a legal scope and no extra rules
nottheonion,not_removed,unbelievable that these people cant put themselves in someone elses shoes im a liberal christian from tennessee bit of a paradox being liberal and a tn christian i know i think well i dont wanna be lumped in with the kkk or westboro baptist church because those assholes arewellassholes i would think most christians would feel this way towards these groups but they somehow still paint a religion with billion followers with one single brush crazy to me
nottheonion,not_removed,thats because when conservative christians are talking about religious freedomliberty theyre not actually talking about religious freedom theyre talking about their nonexistent right to force their beliefs on others its kind of how the same people tend to get antiabortion laws passed to protect womens health its all manipulation because the american public is full of gullible morons
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought they had that pretty much decided back with the whole ground zero mosque thing
nottheonion,not_removed,remember the freedom of religion isnt to protest christianity its to protect everyone from the religious many early colonialists were fleeing religious persecution by christians its literally in the constitution to protect christians from other christians christians are as bad as islamists if given free reign theists must never have power theyre too incapable of rational thought and want to behead nonbelievers i mean we have christian preachers who praised omar mateen the number highest ranking mass murderer in us history
nottheonion,not_removed,i was laughing at the title until read on that this happened in my home state dammit arkansas just dammit
nottheonion,not_removed,clearly by religious freedom what they mean is the freedom to practice christianity duh
nottheonion,not_removed,when american conservatives talk about religious freedom what they mean is christian rule that should be obvious to everyone
nottheonion,not_removed,religious freedom the right of people of faith to freely practice their faith so important trump said hes just so articulate s
nottheonion,not_removed,oh their not grappling with it at all it means christians and no one else
nottheonion,not_removed,i would like to know how in the world someone within the southern baptist convention can support the defending of rights for muslims to construct mosques in the united states when these people threaten our very way of existence as christians and americans because you have to thats the law and if you dont like it you can get out there is no debate
nottheonion,not_removed,far rightaltright folks insist islam is not a religion and islam is not a race so what is it
nottheonion,not_removed,do they understand what that phrase means
nottheonion,not_removed,of course it doesnt include muslims or hindus or buddhists when you hear christian conservative evangelicals whining about religious freedom the freedom they are talking about is the right to force their beliefs preferably codified into law onto everyone else period
nottheonion,not_removed,this is my problem with religious people the lack of self awareness the inability to think critically and the case for special pleading for their particular brand of fairy tale live and let live if this deity you believe in so staunchly is all that powerful said deity will sort it all out you dont have to
nottheonion,not_removed,the old testament kinda sucks
nottheonion,not_removed,short answer yes it does
nottheonion,not_removed,this is how religious freedom evolved in the us first it included only protestants catholics were considered to worship the pope then it was extended to include all christians etc its kind of sickening that were back to all religions are fine but thats not a religion bullshit that argument mostly died out by the
nottheonion,not_removed,reminds me of those people that say they should be able to refuse service to gays because of their beliefs you know for a fact that they would change their mind the moment a devout muslim shop starts refusing entry to women unless they cover up
nottheonion,not_removed,this is so ridiculous the lack of offline exposure the average merican has to islam is probably next to none yet they have extremely polarizing opinions on its billion practitioners nonetheless
nottheonion,not_removed,religious freedom is a nice euphemism for what they are really going for i dont see anyone in the us keeping christians from practicing their faith i do see people not letting the nation get turned into a christian theocracy
nottheonion,not_removed,you cant be too picky on these things if you allow one you have to allow the other
nottheonion,not_removed,i think it should just be the same as what we try for ideally with all laws as much freedom to do what you want as long as it isnt hurting other people why should it be any more complicated than that
nottheonion,not_removed,social conservatives are the most entitled people in the world they dont just want shit they think god wants them to have shit and get their way its like dipshit divine right
nottheonion,not_removed,the only freedom that counts is the freedom to do what some other people think to be wrong there is no point in demanding freedom to do that which all will applaud all the socalled liberties or rights are things which have to be asserted against others who claim that if such things are to be allowed their own rights are infringed or their own liberties threatened this is always true even when we speak of the freedom to worship of the right of free speech or association or of public assembly if we are to allow freedoms at all there will constantly be complaints that either the liberty itself or the way in which it is exercised is being abused and if it is a genuine freedom those complaints will often be justified there is no way of having a free society in which there is no abuse abuse is the very hallmark of liberty former lord chief justice hailsham
nottheonion,not_removed,how about this i know its crazy everyone practice whatever religion you want dont use your religion to justify being shitty and dont kill people
nottheonion,not_removed,is this even rnottheonion i guess there are people who dont live around conservative christians but this is definitely the mentality they have
nottheonion,not_removed,tbh i dont know what all the confusion is about ive read extensively about religion in my free time islamchristianityjudaism all worship the same god but we just have differing views
nottheonion,not_removed,yes im a christian and have been for a long time freedom of religion is not something that is exclusive to christians nor should it be
nottheonion,not_removed,well if your religion is to subrogate women and execute gays for being gay then no you dont have freedom of religion human rights for all comes before your religious beliefs
nottheonion,not_removed,omgthis bullshit rhetoric will never end islam is not the problem fundamentalism especially the kind originating from a destabilized region currently in a power struggle is the problem christianity hads a problem with it as well granted today christian extremism may not be as prevalent as the muslim variety but regardless terrorism stems from all corners of the world just look at the ira and before anyone starts firing off about the differences between ira and isil remember that isil hates the west because we fucked with them first we took out saddam and his version of socialism and sent the region into the flames for the sunnis so no shit they are going to want to retaliate
nottheonion,not_removed,religious freedom should not allow for misogynistic racist or homophobic requirements
nottheonion,not_removed,religious freedom is fine and dandy but when a religion advocates a legal system with punishments such as an extra tax for nonbelievers and execution for apostasy and homosexuality its no longer a religion
nottheonion,not_removed,just these people i dont group everyone into a thing i can label it goes case by case it transcends religion as well
nottheonion,not_removed,as a guy who identifies as a conservative christian this is something that baffles me about so many of my peers to me and thankfully a lot like me the issue of religious freedom is a nobrainer its for everyone or no one if im allowed to believe and practice my faith then so is every single other person yes i may believe my faith is right and yours is wrong but far be it from me to stop you this is america believe and practice what you want
nottheonion,not_removed,im a conservative and a christian as long as youre not trying to kill random people america states you have freedom of religion will i try to talk to you about christ and convert you maybe but in a nice way of i do will you try to do the same to me possibly and that is okay the bible says very specifically that there are a great many people who call him lord that wont get into heaven who will claim they lived and worked for him that wont make it because they never actually knew him most christians in america fit this bill christianity at its base means that we love and forgive everyone including those culture may see as mortal enemies no matter what they are doing to us or what we may perceive they are doing i know christians that still live this way not many but i do and you wont hear about them much because theyre quiet and not busybodies as a note being a busybody is condemned in the bible muslim atheist pantheist whateverthey have religious and philosophical freedom i wont agree but im not making you do anything dont make me do anything lets all just relax for petes sake why are we all so angry why dont we just have a picnic or something lets all strive to be the very best human beings we can lets read play love and work and stop acting like that person who is different than you people on the left and right this applies equally to you are your enemy they might be antagonistic to youbut living in fear of maybes living in hate or anger living in any state other than love and forgiveness just hurts you
nottheonion,not_removed,conservative christians grapple with the meaning of words singularly concepts uniformly and history unequivocally
nottheonion,not_removed,the sooner we accept that all religions are bunk the better well be able to protect ourselves from the more violent ones until then expect the more violent ones to enjoy the benefits of all of the religious freedoms we bestow upon all citizens
nottheonion,not_removed,im all for religious freedom but not religious indoctrination of children that goes for all religions i dont think parents should be allowed to make there children wear religious headware or hardware crosses the only reason religion and religious conflict persists is because brainwashed people keep brainwashing their children
nottheonion,not_removed,so what you are saying is that a group of people that struggles with observing the world in a neutral and objective manner is struggling to apply rules in a neutral and objective manner good gracious how unexpected
nottheonion,not_removed,my biggest complaint with conservative christians is how gullible they are and get mislead often by church members i know couple of ministers who are using their support for lavishness foreign holidays and what not
nottheonion,not_removed,why is it that the most overtly religious folks end up being the biggest sinners
nottheonion,not_removed,awww those poor conservative christians having to grapple not liking what the on whether religious freedom includes muslims
nottheonion,not_removed,how about a little freedom from religion im tired of it infecting every aspect of life i tire of hearing it talked about like something that should be respected in an age where we basically know how we got here if not the fine details it is all well and fine to have questions and not be sure about things but our need to continually coddle something that should really be treated as a lack of understanding at the low end and a mental illness at the high end is beginning to wear a bit thin i know it sounds hateful and i certainly dont like feeling this way id rather not but im sick of it i believe people will murder if they are murderers i believe people will do sick things to one another regardless of whether a particular ideology is followed or not what i dont believe is that people cant pick up a book or google for a few hours to enlighten themselves to the basic realities of biological principle i think that hole people mistake being filled with religion or what have you is literally a lack of information treat people with respect dont be a dick dont make a habit of fucking up someone elses day because of the need to inflict your mental disorders on someone else these are rules we can all abide by period it is time to wake up

nottheonion,not_removed,yep conservative christians are despicable all of them they restrict our rights everyday they oppress women and religious minorities and persecute gays harshly i think christianity is a cancer that needs to dieohhh wait thats islam d
nottheonion,not_removed,they monitored churches to see if they were being used as fronts for white supremacist terror cells they should monitor any mosque suspected of terror apparently saudi arabia monitors their own mosques for this reason
nottheonion,not_removed,conservative christian here i believe that salvation through jesus christ is the only way to eternal life and a freedom from punishment for sin i also have many muslim friends as well as friends from other religions and lacks thereof many of my muslim friends are very worried about the current atmosphere of politics in the us a lot of them have been verbally abused and threatened and some are afraid to go outside some of them just keep to themselves and stay home except to go to work and to the store they have few friends and dont get out much other than necessary travels it is heartbreaking to see the loneliness and fear they deal with my wife and i were helping one family with scholarship applications and general college prep for their son and she was going to go with them to visit a college i had to work the mother was worried that if she went and people saw her in her headscarf theyd treat her son who doesnt look muslim poorly it is tremendously sad to see so many people ignore the love thy neighbor part of the bible that jesus said was so important
nottheonion,not_removed,im an agnostic and fairly uninterested individual to these particular events but this is a pretty fucked up article in the way its being construed here the matter of the fact is that radical islam is currently comparable to radical christianity during the holy crusades trying to compare christianity of the modern age to the shit radicals have done in the name of the quran in our time is totally asinine the radicals of islam are trying to spill blood wherever they can purge the unbelievers all in the name of their god while that shit as of recent has been on a harsh decline for christians in the united states since a long time ago its not because theyve always been that way peaceful its because we shut that shit down in our territory and said they need to understand that everyone is free to do their own thing here over in they east the radicals dont understand that why do i know because ive been deployed there and watched a man march his child up to our entry control point just to detonate the strapped bombs on her so she could kill my presumably christian coworker assigned to the front gate that night do not equate your muslim friend who grew up in the united states to the current state of radical islam its not the same thing
nottheonion,not_removed,fucking hypocrites those conservative christians
nottheonion,not_removed,its conservatism thats your issue these baptists and the ones who want the donald to round up rag heads are conservative and probably conservative christians those goat fuckers in isis are what happens when no one is around to police their conservative islam we drone strike a wedding they have angry muslims to convert to conservative nut bag islam because those normal muslims feel they are powerless against the western alliance of nations they shoot a bunch of people in a club the angry amongst us turn to conservative leaders who scream the loudest for retribution because we too feel powerless its us vs them and its those caught in the middle who bleed
nottheonion,not_removed,ahhhh yes the old my religion is the true and right religion and yours isnt nonsense christians have been doing this for years wanting to stomp on other religions and claim they dont have the same rights as they do
nottheonion,not_removed,oh yeah we believe in strong convictions and religious liberty but if youre not a part of our specific religion then you can fuck right off we couldnt find even a tenth of a fuck to give about your religious freedoms
nottheonion,not_removed,this is reminiscent of the safe space mentality its not exclusive to any one group its a human phenomenon we want our area to be composed of those who agree with us and our rules it sounds a lot more sensible when you put it like that but sometimes sounding sensible isnt enough the whole idea of a mixed nation is rather insensible at times but i would hold that it is the right thing to have
nottheonion,not_removed,religion is like a mentally ill uncle best kept tucked away and handled privately also fuck those morons at the sbc
nottheonion,not_removed,was scientology looked at
nottheonion,not_removed,itt ashamed of being a christian
nottheonion,not_removed,some of them in the article get it right thoughreligious freedom is for all of us or its for none of us
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean yes its freedom of religion not freedom of christianity
nottheonion,not_removed,its not like the founding fathers didnt also discuss this as a topic in general they seem to have been tolerant of it whatever then again if you had one of the ffs discuss religion with a modern bornagain type the latter would be condemning the former as some sort of heathen
nottheonion,not_removed,the people that think this way are some of the scariest people in the usa
nottheonion,not_removed,just a bunch of assholes
nottheonion,not_removed,the stupid god damn it hurts my head so much and to think people like this actually have political influence
nottheonion,not_removed,thats how you start going down a road find the one instance where people decide to agree with you and then start lining up your entire agenda behind that
nottheonion,not_removed,jesus christ people
nottheonion,not_removed,i need some soul freedom
nottheonion,not_removed,so tired of freedom of religion interfaith coalitions and religion in general how about your religion is banned from even local politics no prayer before town hall meetings no benediction before sporting events nothing imagine a a world where religion ends at the door of the church mosque etc
nottheonion,not_removed,it doesnt make any sense to say one certain religion is exempt from freedom of religion the founders went to great lengths to ensure all faiths are included as they said freedom of religion and not freedom of christian denominations i just dont get how people dont understand this i think when you are of the religious type you just cant understand how someone can believe something different than you being a terrorist is a crime but being in a religion that has a terrorism problem at the moment is not a freaking crime or cause for banishment
nottheonion,not_removed,if only conservative christians knew how highly muslims esteem and revere jesus and mary
nottheonion,not_removed,i laughed out loud when i read the title religion is too much elevated thinking and philosophy for the average practitioneradherentmeaning it is beyond the scope of comprehension for the the average person sadly this out of reach thinking about things like philosophy to the average ham egger includes the likes of the constitution of the usa and the bill of rights
nottheonion,not_removed,til a lot of people dont understand what freedom of religion means nor that it is already protected under freedom of speech
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont understand how this is even an issue with them how dense are they yes it includes muslims it includes everybody its the freedom to follow any religion
nottheonion,not_removed,freedom of religion should include muslimchristiansbuddhism etc etcthat being said none of worlds religions have the right to impose their beliefs on nonreligious people whether they are christian muslim etc the debate shouldnt be about allowing more people to bring their ideologies into this country rather how do we keep all fundamentalists christianmuslim from imposing their beliefs and killing those who dont agree with them
nottheonion,not_removed,western religions are problematic this includes islamchristianityjudaism
nottheonion,not_removed,i do believe muslims deserve civil courtesy ive known hundreds and i enjoy interacting with them whatever happens in the end of the world i know that muslims today by and large are sincere wellintentioned people deserving of equal dignity the most christian attitude is one of witnessing to gods love for all people and not recklessly antagonizing others
nottheonion,not_removed,this kind of stuff makes me so angry its not religious freedom if it doesnt account for all religions
nottheonion,not_removed,so ultimately they could be choosing to restrict their own freedoms by voting in favor of limiting religious freedoms to keep muslims from going to hell ironic
nottheonion,not_removed,i would like to know how in the world someone within the southern baptist convention can support the defending of rights for muslims umm the constitution or do unto others as you would have them do unto you
nottheonion,not_removed,as a christian i find this line of thought horrible im also fairly conservative though more the libertyfreedom wing
nottheonion,not_removed,hahahaha what a bunch of savage idiots of course it does
nottheonion,not_removed,as an atheist its incomprehensible to me that this is an unfamiliar issue to a lot of conservative christians
nottheonion,not_removed,remember no one ever reports on the reasonable people muslim christian or atheist
nottheonion,not_removed,it doesnt look at the original writings surrounding the constitution they never thought that there would be muslims trying to enter the us or that they would want to except to kill
nottheonion,not_removed,fucking fundies
nottheonion,not_removed,only if they cant stay away from your throat or head
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe they should call it christian freedom
nottheonion,not_removed,its easy to laugh and roll your eyes at this i know i did but to have the southern baptist convention publicly affirm the right of muslims to build mosques is quite an evolution of their position since i was raised in the church years ago
nottheonion,not_removed,christians are so hateful haha
nottheonion,not_removed,nothing to see in the comments here folks turn back while you can
nottheonion,not_removed,i grew up in an open minded southern baptist church some of the memebers are gay or atheist and we argue religious freedom is for every religion
nottheonion,not_removed,its not about any religion believe what you want however once you decide its okay to force others to believe what you believe youve crossed a line its not about religion its about power disguised as religion
nottheonion,not_removed,answer yes
nottheonion,not_removed,oh my bad
nottheonion,not_removed,its entropy life gets more complicated as we go on eventually well all get stuck in the mud spinning our wheels to try to get out but we wont so lets all go home and make a nice sandwich and sit on the porch
nottheonion,not_removed,well shape our nations laws according to our religion because thats religious freedom but sharia law is barbaric and is something to be on the watch for
nottheonion,not_removed,you can worship whoever you want as long as they are jesus
nottheonion,not_removed,as long as they arent killing people because of their religion they can do whatever they want
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought this was priceless he believes christianity is the only true faith and people must choose it freely
nottheonion,not_removed,it amazes me how they can be so selfcentered all the time
nottheonion,not_removed,lucky for muslims that they dont need anyones permission or approval to follow their religion allah has chosen islam as the religion sure you can block building of mosques you can block public prayers through fines and violence but you cannot without all the might and power you have force a heart and a persons mind
nottheonion,not_removed,what sucks is a lot of people think far right conservative christians are indicative of christians in general and this idiocy just makes arguments against christianity look more and more valid im convinced fox is sending subliminal mind alternating waves through tv to indoctrinate these people or they reading a different bible maybe both
nottheonion,not_removed,rolling my eyes to infinity and beyond over here
nottheonion,not_removed,actual person who believes this stuff and had seen mostly ridicule here two things for now just because one person who says theyre a christian says something doesnt mean its representative of the whole if you think every church is burning qurans like that dude in florida for example youve bought into a media narrative that simply doesnt reflect reality anyone i know who has espoused religious freedom has done it for everyone remember the supreme court case with the muslim the hijab and abercrombie many articles ive read about religious freedom with regards to supporting same sex marriage have included similar examples such as a jewish person making a nazi cake or a muslim butcher serving pork questions feel free to ask
nottheonion,not_removed,if you want protection and the right to believe in a fairy god father of your design you gota let them have their fun too
nottheonion,not_removed,yes it does source am conservative christian
nottheonion,not_removed,yup sure does what freedom of religion does not mean is killing people in the name of your invisible friend but it really doesnt matter what way you point when you pray to him
nottheonion,not_removed,yes theyre hypocrites but because they all dont care if theyre hypocrites it has no effect
nottheonion,not_removed,they should probably read a bit about this guy httpsenwikipediaorgwikirogerwilliamschurchandstate
nottheonion,not_removed,moderate muslims in action
nottheonion,not_removed,no christian i know is grappling islam is a political ideology with a religion attached to it if you believe in sharia law you cant be a part of a free society with other religions your rights end where the other mans nose begins and such
nottheonion,not_removed,once i saw this guy on a bridge about to jump i said dont do it he said nobody loves me i said god loves you do you believe in god he said yes i said are you a christian or a jew he said a christian i said me too protestant or catholic he said protestant i said me too what franchise he said baptist i said me too northern baptist or southern baptist he said northern baptist i said me too northern conservative baptist or northern liberal baptist he said northern conservative baptist i said me too northern conservative baptist great lakes region or northern conservative baptist eastern region he said northern conservative baptist great lakes region i said me too northern conservative†baptist great lakes region council of or northern conservative baptist great lakes region council of he said northern conservative baptist great lakes region council of i said die heretic and i pushed him over emo phillips albert einstein
nottheonion,not_removed,you can have any religion you want as long as its the same one i have
nottheonion,not_removed,it goes beyond religion with them its how they view freedom itself they have a vision of america that pretty much resembles a norman rockwell painting you are free to do anything you want provided it fits within that framework you can go hunting or if that isnt your thing you can go fishing or play baseball or football you can be a carpenter or a farmer or a pharmacist you can have a picnic with your well groomed family in the park or you can taking up hiking or surfing any of these things you have so much freedom you are free to do any of these approved things however you cant have an abortion smoke pot buy liquor on sunday have a drink in public watch pornography sleep with someone of the same sex teach things that contradict the bible build a mosque put nonchristian monuments on public property and so on those things need to be regulated away
nottheonion,not_removed,once i saw one of my facebook friends say its freedom of religion not freedom from religion it made me so angry
nottheonion,not_removed,so does this mean i can worship jesus by burning bibles
nottheonion,not_removed,coincidentally mormons have been perhaps the most vocal christian group in supporting religious freedom for muslims
nottheonion,not_removed,funny that most christians dont even realize that as muslims we are obligated to believe in jesus as the messiah and to follow and obey his commandments we just differ over what those commandments are
nottheonion,not_removed,technically this would allow islam as well since they believe in jesus
nottheonion,not_removed,because mormons believe in a different jesus in the book of mormon jesus and satan are brothers since it doesnt say that in the bible most religious scholars agree that mormons are actually worshipping satans brother sidney historians know sidney to be a practical joker also he went through a hippy phase and grew out his hair and beard once he realized he looked just like youknowwho he started fucking with people big time sidney is fair skinned and has light hair so many believe it is actually sidney that is pictured in most oldtimey paintings of jesus
nottheonion,not_removed,at my church they said that they didnt believe in religion religion is what everyone else believes in because they believed in the one true god they said every single muslim in the world wants to kill you and that its a medical fact that men have one less rib than women because god took a rib from adam and that the world is years old and scientists once carbon dated a live snail and the test said the snail was millions of years old so carbon dating is bullshit they said i had the devil in me because i was gay too and they tried to drive the devil out of me by putting their hands on me and mumbling something incomprehensible while chanting loudly
nottheonion,not_removed,i remember when the un abolished religious holidays in favor of the all inclusive and politically correct
nottheonion,not_removed,shit dude do you want to get us in trouble you fucking know you cant say the mc words anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,dont you know white conservative heterosexual middleclass christians are the most persecuted group in america do you not have fox news at home
nottheonion,not_removed,well hes not wrong here in a little less than months people will indeed be saying merry christmas again
nottheonion,not_removed,there is no better reason to say happy holidays every time then knowing that sometimes its really gonna piss someone off who wants me to say merry christmas
nottheonion,not_removed,i love the keep christ in christmas people who apparently dont realize that they stole the winter solstice holiday from pagans among many other things
nottheonion,not_removed,i had to undergo a year of reeducation the alliteration of happy holidays drives me nuts
nottheonion,not_removed,rthanksobama
nottheonion,not_removed,just so you dont feel like only us has this conservatives in denmark have said the same thing im part of this political party because i want people to say merry christmas again christmasyule is so much a part of our culture not just like religionwise its traditionfamily hygge that some muslism families give their kids gifts on christmas because all their classmates does its ridicules claiming people dont celebrate christmas anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,the war on christmas left all battlefields incapable of recuperating
nottheonion,not_removed,why would you be exclusive when it comes to celebrating holidays more holidays that include giving gifts thats just more reasons for gifts
nottheonion,not_removed,nah being from arkansas hes intimately familiar with the finer points of porcine politics all americans inherently have the freedom of religion but some religions are more free than others
nottheonion,not_removed,armorel baptist church please tell me i am not the only one that read that as amoral baptist church
nottheonion,not_removed,thats like saying those christians are protesting at veterans funerals all over the us when its really just the wbc
nottheonion,not_removed,this guy ever heard about the inquisition
nottheonion,not_removed,no its screw religious freedom unless its the same as this pastors
nottheonion,not_removed,i think no matter what religion your freedom should not extend that of anyone else so basically as long as youre not breaking the law do whatever you want
nottheonion,not_removed,considering that american christians went over there and killed about half a million muslims in iraq alone
nottheonion,not_removed,on behalf of both the wofford family and the christian community this guy is both a nut and a bigot while i will defend a persons right to say another religion is wrong the kind of ignorance needed to think you should have rights that others shouldnt have is beyond reason and very close to hatered
nottheonion,not_removed,this httpsyoutubeaqdyuslzttu shows the full question and then the answer most christians do believe in freedom of religion even if they dont believe all religions are true as a southern baptist myself i am constantly shamed by the way many of my fellow baptists act they seem to forget that the purpose of christianity is not to force people to behave in a way that makes themselves feel comfortable but to reach out to a world in trouble to extend the grace and the love of god those who use something as beautiful as that to spread hate make me sick and angry i can promise you that god is not happy with these people galatians i am amazed that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of christ for a different gospel which is really not another only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of christ but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you he is to be accursed as we have said before so i say again now if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received he is to be accursed
nottheonion,not_removed,i love how he also manages to forget that the majority of people killed by muslim extremists are not christian or not killed because theyre christian but for other reasons its mostly other muslims and lgbt folk but nah only the christians matter fucks sake
nottheonion,not_removed,from the south too more churches than people how does that work
nottheonion,not_removed,hell i live in urbanized illinois and its the same story
nottheonion,not_removed,who hasnt really
nottheonion,not_removed,murdering people and taking over shit is kind of an american tradition
nottheonion,not_removed,the flds groups are still at the ready to do that
nottheonion,not_removed,a small group of mormons murdered some settlers you make it sound as though the entire church rose up and killed a bunch of people
nottheonion,not_removed,its kinda like the conservatives that are hellbent on protecting the amendment but not giving two shits about the
nottheonion,not_removed,jerking off to the constitution i actually laughed out loud thank you
nottheonion,not_removed,its almost as if its not a perfect thing
nottheonion,not_removed,jesus is mentioned more times in the quran than muhammad iirc i might be mistaken
nottheonion,not_removed,she actually has her own chapter
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah like how people have their kids choose their faith in front of all the church goers and their family and basically everyone that they know or ya know not and see where those cards fall
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty sure those islamists say the exact same thing just minus the freely part
nottheonion,not_removed,what is dead may never die
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,southern baptist here trust very little of what the media says about us they always seem to be able to find the worst among us and use them to drag the rest of us through the mud speaking for myself and echoing what has been said in public by my church leadership very few of us want to limit the religious freedoms of other people this is regardless of what god they pray to i have good friends who are muslim jewish atheist etc i believe everyone should have the right to choose what religion if any to belong to i might not agree with you but that doesnt mean you should be barred from making that choice tldr as a southern baptist in the north everyone should be able to legally worship whoever or whatever they want
nottheonion,not_removed,everyone does that not just christians no true scotsman
nottheonion,not_removed,thats kind of the human condition unfortunately xenophobia is the leading cause of hate were still just as bad as the cavemen we just have more powerful weapons and bigger tribes the funny thing is all the tough bigots cant understand that their hate and anger comes from fear they are scared because of their own ignorance its easier to group all of x into one mold than to take people on who that person is
nottheonion,not_removed,thats more a symptom of the fact that theres no real understanding or empathy towards ideas andor people who dont match up with their particular life experiences no connection no empathy they can connect with the christian community and say one is bad because they better understand the tenants of the faith they can see the hypocrisies of radicals and fundamentalists in their own faith but cant for others like islam because they dont know the intricacies imo ignorance poses far more danger than malice
nottheonion,not_removed,the difference is that there is no justification to bomb abortion clinics in the christian doctrine yet there is ample instructions in islam to kill westerners christians jews hindus gays apostates adulters and so on as an atheist i believe in freedom of religion but that does not mean all religions are equal according to their own doctrines im not trying to go down the rabbit hole of how many people within islamchristianity follow their doctrine to the letter just specifically what following it to the letter would look like
nottheonion,not_removed,just to be clear are you referring only to the specific people quoted in this article or are you just as hypocritical as them in judging a group based on the actions of a few
nottheonion,not_removed,and theres been what abortion clinic bombings in the last years try comparing those numbers to muslim terror
nottheonion,not_removed,the difference is that theres no christian terrorist groups that are repeatedly in the news for killings
nottheonion,not_removed,this is a legitimate question because i see that point made a lot how many abortion clinics have actually been bombed by christians im sure its happened but i feel like ive never actually heard of it happening
nottheonion,not_removed,dont make the same mistake of overgeneralization the vast majority of us christians understand that freedom of religion is for everyone
nottheonion,not_removed,generalizing is a very juvenile approach to take i would expect more from an intellectual like yourself
nottheonion,not_removed,they saw the bomber or shooter is mentally ill
nottheonion,not_removed,while i cant speak to your experiences i can say the christians ive talked to have pointed out that its not the fact that all muslims are terrorists but the fact that a vast majority of the muslims support the acts that terrorists commit if we had a large number of christians bombing abortion clinics here and around the world it would obviously point to a problem however the number is insanely small compared to radical muslims
nottheonion,not_removed,many groups which are conservative teach against that exact thing mennonite and brethren offshoots etc
nottheonion,not_removed,theres the words i was looking for
nottheonion,not_removed,they want freedom to discriminate
nottheonion,not_removed,thats because jesus was white s
nottheonion,not_removed,equal to whom adam of course he was a straight white male
nottheonion,not_removed,its more the morons of the right really i know many right ones to which this isnt an issue
nottheonion,not_removed,the left does the same thing both are really alike in many ways its the horseshoe theory
nottheonion,not_removed,the only moral blank is my moral blank
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt amazing how so many people dont realize that the actions of a few hundredthousand do not adequately characterize a group of billion
nottheonion,not_removed,as a fellow liberal christian i feel your pain ive had to explain so many times that my church welcomes gay members with open arms and that my pastor promotes loving everyone by making it a point to reach out to immigrants the muslim community and so on just like some people need to be made aware that not all muslims are violent others need to be made aware that not all christians are crazy
nottheonion,not_removed,its ok man jesus was a liberal
nottheonion,not_removed,id go with intolerant bigots but youre obviously more polite than i am
nottheonion,not_removed,whatever happened to that
nottheonion,not_removed,to be fair many of those were fleeing persecution for being too fundamentalist or otherwise challenging the existing religious hierarchy the amendments secular intent is a dominant and powerful reading anchored deeply in the other writings of the founders but its primary purpose was to prevent similar hierarchies from being formed here in england of the time the church was merely and extension of royal power thats what they wanted to avoid the religious plurality bit is just a nifty way weve come to enforce it and i for one am extremely grateful
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont want to burst your bubble a lot of theists already have power elected gleefully by people who want them to have power in a way to exert their religious beliefs through their decision making hell you cant even realistically be elected president in the us without explaining your religiosity and how it strengthens your political resolve on the national stage
nottheonion,not_removed,by the way why the fuck is that last part pronounced as saw
nottheonion,not_removed,well legally you cant discriminate against a race or religion so
nottheonion,not_removed,id go with ideology
nottheonion,not_removed,a second amendment rights group s
nottheonion,not_removed,well the ira doesnt count obviously they were black irish
nottheonion,not_removed,i cant believe we even have to call this a philosophical rant its such common sense we are all human but the same old bullshit my tribe is better than your tribe argument has been going around since the dawn of humanity i wish everyone would just get this
nottheonion,not_removed,which is why the separation of church and state is iimportant
nottheonion,not_removed,and dont use public property for your religious monuments
nottheonion,not_removed,amen preach it do away with it all religion served its purpose and has no place in an advanced civilized society we need to teach children philosophical logic in school and critical thinking
nottheonion,not_removed,every debate about religion brings this guy hey religion are crap it better disappear well its not disappearing and your over simplistic opinion is completely useless
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree religion doesnt teach it indoctrinates its borderline child abuse
nottheonion,not_removed,oh ye of little faith now listen closely my son send me and ill show you the glory that is god and maybe send you a picture of my jet
nottheonion,not_removed,well when your church leaders say stuff like this so what i am actually doing if i support and defend the rights of people to construct places of false worship i am helping them go to hell and i do not want to help people go to hell wofford said it becomes easy to see where the intolerance against your fellow man you dislike comes from nothing wrong with your religious views as they are youre own and you are entitled to them but much like wahhabism has given islam a bad name a lot of your church leaders give christianity a bad name as well
nottheonion,not_removed,serious question how do you justify your belief that salvation through jesus christ is the only way to eternal life and a freedom from punishment for sin with modern science technology and philosophy perhaps theres a compelling argument and im ignorant for not knowing what it is
nottheonion,not_removed,living in georgia i see this firsthand too had a former friend going on about how everyone had a right to an opinionuntil that opinion happened to disagree with his political viewpoints
nottheonion,not_removed,yea thats pretty funny in a not haha kind of way
nottheonion,not_removed,no bigotry be civil
nottheonion,not_removed,please be more civil
nottheonion,not_removed,being a conservative christian denotes not reading very much statistically
nottheonion,not_removed,the funny thing is the same people that are all up in arms about this are happy when germany bans scientology there is no difference between scientology and islam they are both religions one just happens to be older and larger than the other
nottheonion,not_removed,its not the same without the emo phillips cadence
nottheonion,not_removed,butbutthere were no great lakes in jesus time
nottheonion,not_removed,nope its httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzbkiycbppfs
nottheonion,not_removed,haha theres a joke like that but muslim version
nottheonion,not_removed,you can eat anything you want as long as its kale
nottheonion,not_removed,the old henry ford paradigm eh no wonder people see conservatives as living in the stone ages i get that people have different beliefs but for the sake of sanity at least be consistent about ones system of beliefs 😒
nottheonion,not_removed,reminds me of george orwells quote everyone is equal but some people are more equal than others
nottheonion,not_removed,you put it very well i would add that criticizing this state of affairs or any of the accepted activities is also frowned upon which leads to very perverse notions of freedom imo freedom liberty and patriotism are the most bastardized words in american english anyone who hasnt read should for a taste look at the definition of httpsenwikipediaorgwikinewspeak
nottheonion,not_removed,bingo i know a very stereotypical baptist american guy who literally believes that america is gods chosen land he legitimately thinks that anyone born in america is inherently better than people elsewhere in the world anyways hes all for going hunting the right to serve etc however if you get him talking about any of those taboo subjects its basically as though youre attacking his great wonderful country you cannot argue with the guy without him immediately getting aggressive i just dont understand how this mentality can be so common that there are entire congregations of people across the states spouting the same absurd garbage its like not a single person in these audiences has the capacity for critical thinking i mean there are plenty of intelligent religious people where are they to help talk these nutjobs extremists out of their absurd fantasy lands
nottheonion,not_removed,im currently working a job where i have to spend hours a day with two conservative christians so far theyve covered a myriad of political topics obama is probably not an american citizen hes definitely a muslim hes a coward for not invading those terrorist countries theyre so sick of obama that even that bitch hilary would be an improvement theyre giddy over trump but think hes too good to be true even if he wins hell probably be assassinated almost right away what else guantanamo bay should never be closed and the only people who are held there are those who have definitively been proved to be terrorists all muslims are either terrorists or terrorist sympathizers it says so right in their bible and we should stop allowing them into this country none of these beliefs were surprising to me individually but taken all together like that jesus christ i couldnt have created a more elaborate strawman if id been making it up i feel like just typing this up is going to get me on a watch list
nottheonion,not_removed,as long as youre a middle class white person all others need not apply
nottheonion,not_removed,you better watch it hippie surfer man
nottheonion,not_removed,i agreed with you right up until you mentioned surfing surfing sounds like a socialism activity a communism activity like that song by those the beatle boys you dont give your daughter a tbird thats a communism you make her man earn it the way daddy earned a freedom with mr flichenburg after gym class
nottheonion,not_removed,luckily most christians arent like this
nottheonion,not_removed,freedom from state sponsored religion is pretty much exactly what the first amendment is about your facebook friend is incredibly misinformed
nottheonion,not_removed,the obvious solution is to say you follow the religion worshiping yourself or pastafarianism pastafarianism is better because its legally recognized as a real religion ramen
nottheonion,not_removed,well i have my religion and i have his part of my religion is to not deny myself happiness without a good reason i may or may not marry someone of the same sex but he probably wants to force me not to thereby forcing me to follow his religion instead of mine freedom of religion is nothing without freedom from religion
nottheonion,not_removed,thats correct youre free to practice islam all you want but im a christian i dont want to practice islam too bad its freedom of religion not from it remember
nottheonion,not_removed,heresy this book is filled with heresies written by people who extort money in order to control you burn them all but seriously dont go burning the bible just in case
nottheonion,not_removed,if jesus tells you to do it then it is fine you should always listen to the voices
nottheonion,not_removed,they ah know a thing or two about religious persecution
nottheonion,not_removed,when i was mormon and a mormon missionary the people who were nicest to me were muslim
nottheonion,not_removed,ive lived amongst them for a long time they take their history very seriously and that includes remembrance of their persecution and journey to utah they hate trump because hes loud vulgar and likes religious persecution theyre highly rightwing and religious but theyre very nice people that way
nottheonion,not_removed,yes not many people know that muslims believe in jesus but not as a god – as a man we believe he was a prophet who taught his nation about islam just as muhammad later on did just as moses did before them abraham noah adam we believe that they all came with the same message that there is only one god and that is the messenger of god it always bothers me when people act as if we have no association with jesus or believe in him in any way
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought he was just a prophet
nottheonion,not_removed,my understanding is that we would disagree on what the messiah is
nottheonion,not_removed,trust me buddy ive tried for years but you cant convince some of these people unless it involves animated ponies or an obscenely large rifle they brag about how they wouldve used if they didnt fail their army physical you cant reason with people who dont acknowledge one side as human beings even their fellow americans
nottheonion,not_removed,wha what form of islam do you follow i thought jesus was a prophet not the messiah in islam
nottheonion,not_removed,since they believe in jesus to evangelical christians believing in jesus means accepting jesus as your personal lord and savior not in merely believing that he existed as a historical personage or even that he was one of multiple prophets those who havent accepted jesus are well working for the other guy note im not an evangelical christian just trying to relate their views as they have been explained to me by evangelicals
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know bout that islam and jesus stuff i heard that their jesus is named allan or something like that to be honest jesus sounds a bit too mexican to me can we change it to a more american sounding name like jason
nottheonion,not_removed,unitarian christians also believe in jesus as simply a prophet and great teacher ironically enough this was more popular during the times of the start of america and some of the first presidents were unitarian john adams is one but yeah islam and christianity are practically the same thing in many ways but the distinction on the divinity of christ makes all the difference
nottheonion,not_removed,ken m
nottheonion,not_removed,almost believed you for a second there
nottheonion,not_removed,most religious scholars agree that mormons are actually worshipping satans brother sidney historians know sidney to be a practical joker occasionally ill run across a christian who will attempt to justify things like god commanding people to commit murder the conversation usually goes something like this me do you believe murder is immoral them of course me but not if god is commanding you to do it them no gods will is perfect he is incapable of immorality me so if god commanded you to kill someone youd do it them i dont know id hope that i would have the courage to follow gods command whatever it is but none of us are perfect the first time i got this response i nearly jumped out of my skin me but if you heard a voice in your head which identified itself as god and commanded you to commit murder how would you know it was actually god how could you be sure it wasnt some kind of trickster demon or just plain old schizophrenia its at this point that they usually run out of good answers and just say something like faith then i close with how do you know the entire book wasnt written by a trickster demon hypothetically lets suppose that satan wanted to amass followers by writing his own bible in which he paints himself as the good guy how can you be sure thats not what the bible is its at this point that they usually get flustered and if online call me a troll and refuse to continue the discussion
nottheonion,not_removed,what the frick im almost positive theres more merit to satan being jesuss brother than this sidney fellow dont recall it in the bible at all what distinguishes mormons in regards to jesus is that they believe jesus and god are separate people if jesus is gods son everyone else is jesuss brother including satan mormons worship god but consider christ of the new testament their savior
nottheonion,not_removed,so is every religion
nottheonion,not_removed,sure but southern baptists have little room to point fingers
nottheonion,not_removed,as an exmormon mormons are mostly just people that are very friendly and happy with their religion i stopped going and believing in the church around sometimes theyd come by and see if id want to come back but they werent mean when i declined either mormons are typically nice people some are definitely rude and pushy but its not the norm that said i do think most of their beliefs are crazy but they should do what makes them happy as long as they dont interfere with others happiness
nottheonion,not_removed,thats discriminatory to the southern hemisphere though
nottheonion,not_removed,now lets all have a lamb taco
nottheonion,not_removed,are you mandy moore
nottheonion,not_removed,even outlaws like the hells angels are afraid to say it
nottheonion,not_removed,you mean hammer time
nottheonion,not_removed,who needs fox when youve got default subs
nottheonion,not_removed,wait have we started the war on christmas yet im working from starbucks is this considered a war zone
nottheonion,not_removed,have you submitted that first sentence to any news paper website comments section lately ive seen it a lot just hoping its satire
nottheonion,not_removed,yea but they dont celebrate christ thats what they have a problem with
nottheonion,not_removed,so does that mean eating southerners isnt kosher
nottheonion,not_removed,thats some animal farm shit right there
nottheonion,not_removed,i read it as armored baptist church and thought it was some sort of heavy military hardware themed church
nottheonion,not_removed,youre not the only one
nottheonion,not_removed,it was not just you
nottheonion,not_removed,but in this case it is even worse
nottheonion,not_removed,nobody expects the inquisition
nottheonion,not_removed,everybodys seen
nottheonion,not_removed,or the crusades
nottheonion,not_removed,someone smarter than me put it better your rights extend to the point where they infringe on someone elses rights all rights being identical for all people of course really the law is largely based on the concept of harm to others ala john stuart mills on liberty this is pretty much goldenrule style do whatever you want as long as it doesnt harm anyone kinda gets tricky in finance but the law is fairly arbitrary when it comes to whether or not its ethical and justified think slavery
nottheonion,not_removed,laws are written by man often powerful rich man who dream of getting richer dont put too much faith in the so called law
nottheonion,not_removed,but that wasnt for god that was for oil so it was ok
nottheonion,not_removed,the kind of ignorance needed to think you should have rights that others shouldnt have is beyond reason and very close to hatered but what if the other person is brown from a different part of the world talks funny and dont believe in no jesus
nottheonion,not_removed,probably a money laundering scheme
nottheonion,not_removed,the amish
nottheonion,not_removed,its true my ancestors were vikings then conquered the new world
nottheonion,not_removed,kind of a human tradition
nottheonion,not_removed,we got that from the british
nottheonion,not_removed,more the former than the latter
nottheonion,not_removed,this is something i find often with people from the usa discussing laws and morality very often people will cite the constitution in the same way a religious zealot would cite the bible as an immutable truth in reality its a piece of paper written by a few people with values very different to todays thats been hacked apart and reinterpreted more than a few times in the last couple of centuries
nottheonion,not_removed,its true islam is quite fond of jesus and friends they believe hes a prophet and messenger of god but not the son of god theyre also very speculative about how he died big picture all three main monotheistic religions have similar bones its the details that rile people up
nottheonion,not_removed,that is correct the most mentioned is moses
nottheonion,not_removed,kids you can go to church or go to bed hungry for the next week you miserable little hellspawn im giving you a choice
nottheonion,not_removed,this is voluntary and you dont have to be here if you dont want to said once the room is full and the prayer is about to start with the only exits are at the front of the room so if you walk out now everyone will see you go
nottheonion,not_removed,it would be nice to hold off until kids turn so the kids can really choose a religion or not once they are an adult
nottheonion,not_removed,can you believe the crazies that believe in the lord of light
nottheonion,not_removed,so northern baptist
nottheonion,not_removed,the trick is to start with hating everyone then as you meet people you take the ones you like off the shit list im so lonely
nottheonion,not_removed,actually ive thought about this a lot and the only thing that would realistically work in fighting this would be mandatory military service i know what your thinking but hear me out when going through basic you meet a whole bunch of new people from all over the place you get everything from whites to asians hispanics some are normal and some might be weird they could be assholes or they can be really cool friends you can also have and will definetly have racists but when your going through basic getting yelled at doing pushups and planks through out the day for fucking up depending on the time you go you can be sweating your ass off or you could be freezing your balls off with around other people you also get alot of time to kill with these people you get to talking you see that they are all human and can actually get along specially when you add the danger factor of being a soldier and those people have your back of course this would work alot better if it was a global thing and not just in a few countries but basic does bring people together by force at times but it worked
nottheonion,not_removed,there are absolutely passages in the bible that condone killing
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah im all for muslims having the freedom to practice religion but the facts are that i dont have to be afraid of going to major nations now because of christian groups that will literally kill you for being muslim or jewish im sure that they arent true muslims but if thats the main identifying factor between all of them then thats the main identifying factor
nottheonion,not_removed,and then go on to write legislation that hurts the mentally ill and try to repeal legislation that helps the mentally ill
nottheonion,not_removed,i feel like adam would have been some kind of beige
nottheonion,not_removed,well he probably was straight for lack of alternatives if for no other reason
nottheonion,not_removed,eh intolerant bigots would mean that most people actually are capable of or are putting forth the effort to understand what these people are saying and getting passed i dont have that kind of faith in my fellow americans i think most people are either too stupid to understand that a religious freedom or protect womens health law isnt actually that or theyre too lazy to look into it further and they get distracted by the pretty words instead
nottheonion,not_removed,it wasnt really a mosque and wasnt actually at ground zero just a muslim community centre in manhattan
nottheonion,not_removed,just wait until you hear about mackinac island
nottheonion,not_removed,its really sad to see one family out of their faith put aside close to for some minister every month they recently had trouble making rent as they were moving cities and this fellow in the meantime is holidaying abroad seen it happening way too often edit a word
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont see it as helping people construct places of false worship so much as making sure everyone is treated equally and fairly it makes me angry that so many people are worried about just walking down the street or worried what will happen to them if trump gets elected i mean just look at the history of after people get so blinded by hatred they dont even realize theyre terrorizing the wrong people its no wonder some of my friends are afraid especially living in the south
nottheonion,not_removed,no its not did you totally miss the part where i typed words
nottheonion,not_removed,now i live in georgia and ive never seen that and i happen to live in a very conservative area may i ask where in georgia you live from milton
nottheonion,not_removed,thats true i personally think scientology is more of a scam then anything but at the end of the day if it is a religion
nottheonion,not_removed,he smiled jewishly
nottheonion,not_removed,⊙▂⊙ ooooooooooohhh oooooohhh mic drop wooorldstaaar
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,major flaw in story down vote entire thread
nottheonion,not_removed,easy there satan
nottheonion,not_removed,you can buy a model t in any color you want as long as its blackhenry ford for those who dont know
nottheonion,not_removed,sadly there are almost no belief systems that are consistent either in text teachings or practice it kind of comes with the territory i think
nottheonion,not_removed,many religions seem to work on assumptions that are allinclusive even to nonbelievers atheists may not believe in a god but to religious folks they are part of gods realm regardless and are in simple need of guidance the vision they have of society is one that has everyone follow the teachings of that particular realm and to do otherwise is seen to go against the nature of things in that viewpoint its like a supertunnel vision of society their notion of freedom is one that conforms everyone to their path of being saved or uplifted or whatever nirvanaheavenafterlife that they wait for try and go against that vision and youll be seen as corrupting their work of saving the planet and condemning yourself and how many others you influence around you to damnation essentially if they had their way everyone would be saved without them having to do anything since itd be the law
nottheonion,not_removed,for what its worth even when someone says of course ive read theres a pretty good chance they are lying i heard its literally the number book that people lie about having read to try to sound sophisticated to their friends or strangers a new survey reveals what english teachers already know over half of people lie about having read classic works of literature in order to appear smarter according to a poll widely reported in the british press percent of those surveyed had lied about reading a classic book in order to look more intellectual in a social situation topping the list of books that people claimed to have read but hadnt is george orwells with twentysix percent of respondents admitting to fibbing about it close on its heels is leo tolstoys war and peace with nineteen percent and charles dickens great expectations with eighteen percent also on the list lord of the rings and catcher in the rye other tactics to appear more intelligent include wearing glasses unnecessarily using a thesaurus to make words in documents of emails sound more impressive and exaggerating knowledge of wine
nottheonion,not_removed,if newspeak didnt sound so double plus good id probably be more against it
nottheonion,not_removed,everyone i say this to fights me tooth and nail on it but law order are diametrically opposed to freedom liberty
nottheonion,not_removed,anyone who hasnt read should as far as im concerned thats a universal truth
nottheonion,not_removed,nobody thinks they believe that anymore though
nottheonion,not_removed,the batshit crazy fanatic ones are though noisy and willing to work together for the common cause of making everyone miserable
nottheonion,not_removed,wont matter if there is enough of them to hijack conservative politics
nottheonion,not_removed,the problem is that even if we assume you are right it means that most christians hide at home and never say anything to contradict the christians who do think like that where are your most christians when the others are out there working to enforce that norman rockwell dictatorship i dont see them fighting against them
nottheonion,not_removed,agreed hes one of those everybody needs god in their lives type of people
nottheonion,not_removed,well no thats just the first article then comes free exercise which traditionally doesnt include retail sales then all the major nonreligious types of free expression
nottheonion,not_removed,or discordianism hail eris
nottheonion,not_removed,then theyve got the sincerely held religious beliefs language written into the rules and regulations of various institutions thats the workaround that allows random dmv clerks to decide if ones religion is valid or not
nottheonion,not_removed,ha good idea but id rather just be free of religion altogether edit to clarify i mean i dont want to follow religion personally not that other people shouldnt be able to
nottheonion,not_removed,the obvious solution is to say you follow the religion worshiping yourself church of satan
nottheonion,not_removed,satanism would work well too although most christians have no idea what thats about
nottheonion,not_removed,what if the lord of light grants you your wishes for the sacrifice
nottheonion,not_removed,the only problem with burning bibles is the unnecessary environmental impact composting is probably the better option
nottheonion,not_removed,probably one of the only other abrahamic religions that can sympathize with abstaining from alcohol
nottheonion,not_removed,as someone raised mormon and recently notmormon they take their history the same way everyone does cling on to the vile actions against your own group without acknowledging the vile acts your group has caused
nottheonion,not_removed,its because your association with jesus is considered blasphemous to christians
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah a lot of people simply dont know its better to teach this at young ages i learned about this in my catholic school at yo
nottheonion,not_removed,til thanks for helping me understand that aspect of islam ive studied most religions a bit but have never heard a clear answer on that
nottheonion,not_removed,hes actually just a very naughty boy
nottheonion,not_removed,this is not the greatest messiah in the world this is just a prophet
nottheonion,not_removed,well messiah of the jews ie the prophet hes also getting his judgement day return along with mahdi
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt he their most quoted prophet idk a rap song told me that might not be true
nottheonion,not_removed,all abrahamic faiths believe he will return to earth etc etc the main difference is the belief of jesus being a form of god under the trinity but what he said did preached and all is canon for muslims and in sunday school in the we were encouraged to study more about jesus and be more vocal about his role in islam
nottheonion,not_removed,i get the rest of the comment but bronies
nottheonion,not_removed,he is called almasih in the quran which translates to the messiah in english although i think the roles of the messiah differ between christianity and islam i believe he will come back and fight against the antichristal masih ad dajjal
nottheonion,not_removed,hes name is mentioned as messih meaning messiah we are required to follow and obey all the messengers of god jesus was a messenger of god and a prophet
nottheonion,not_removed,heck there are evangelicals that dont believe that catholics are christians
nottheonion,not_removed,dont let em read too much about thomas jefferson then
nottheonion,not_removed,this i grew up in an evangelical household the islamic view of jesus is considered blasphemy in christianity
nottheonion,not_removed,satan is really all over the place in their minds isnt he
nottheonion,not_removed,hey zeus
nottheonion,not_removed,shit take away the central importance of muhammad and jesus to their various faiths and judaism christianity and islam sound so similar i dont think an alien from otter space would tell them apart
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah so the thing about god in the modern church interpretation is that he doesnt talk to people most theologians will say that they cant be sure he ever did with any certainty the explanation is a stance of nonintervention in the modern day since the presence of a messiah as an intermediary and messenger bookends the religion its less direct communication more go check the handbook if youre hearing voices its probably schizophrenia
nottheonion,not_removed,while i personally am not disagreeing with you most people would
nottheonion,not_removed,fuck that im australian whats snow
nottheonion,not_removed,i propose that snowflake day be changed to holiday day the holiday about celebrating holidays as an even more allinclusive alternative for our friends in the southern hemisphere and all others unilaterally opposed to positive depictions of snow
nottheonion,not_removed,yea man fucking hemispherism so what if like of the worlds population is in the northern hemisphere it dont make it right
nottheonion,not_removed,good fuck them
nottheonion,not_removed,give it time
nottheonion,not_removed,when merry christmas is outlawed only outlaws will say merry christmas
nottheonion,not_removed,satire no just fighting the good fight so one day my children may live in a country where they wont be routinely discriminated against by the gay liberal jewish hollywood lobby open your eyes sheeple
nottheonion,not_removed,not kosher nor halal the best kind of haram
nottheonion,not_removed,best check the broble see if its okay
nottheonion,not_removed,worked in far cry
nottheonion,not_removed,well there was a band called armored saint so not that far off
nottheonion,not_removed,nope its a church with leather seats and a vinyl dashboard
nottheonion,not_removed,here in germany are indeed wehrkirchen churches which were built like fortresses
nottheonion,not_removed,were still waiting for part to come out in the theaters
nottheonion,not_removed,wasnt the bible written by men as well
nottheonion,not_removed,well its all we have something isnt inherently good by being a law but without it society collapses
nottheonion,not_removed,it also wasnt the decision of christian groups to go over there and kill people it was the government unless we suddenly want to pretend church and state separation doesnt exist to help make the premise viable i think its weird that everyone in this thread is acting like these christian pastors and the us government are the same thing but if you try to make the true statement that you cannot separate church and state in islam by the very nature of the religion people act like youre insane and theres no possible way thats true even though thats how islam acts in any country you put it in and then put it in charge it always takes over the government and there always becomes zero separation of church and state at the end most people in this thread are making arguments where if you replaced christian with muslim the argument would be just as sound but theyre acting like the christians are infinitely more hypocritical than islam thats a crock of horseshit
nottheonion,not_removed,its still wrong read the law
nottheonion,not_removed,and what if they believe its okay to kill you for being homosexual or support those that do
nottheonion,not_removed,man i love the amish i dont understand their way of life and beliefs very well but they are true masters of food great bread fresh produce and pies so many pies i thought i made good pies then i bought one from the amish at the farmers market
nottheonion,not_removed,youve obviously never seen one hijack a carriage at needlepoint
nottheonion,not_removed,the amish are anabaptists who were probably the most insane group in the radical reformation and killedcoercedforcibly converted thousands in preparation for the apocalypse
nottheonion,not_removed,you really like semi colons dont you
nottheonion,not_removed,especially since they most often revere amendments which are themselves changes
nottheonion,not_removed,not to mention that its writers put in a way to change it that they themselves used
nottheonion,not_removed,jesus and friends pretty underrated saturday morning cartoon series
nottheonion,not_removed,honestly its the different culture that does another fun fact the quran doesnt tell women to cover their hair the bible does
nottheonion,not_removed,the split between the three abrahamic religions can be summed up with the words no i am
nottheonion,not_removed,its like a grown up fight over whether book or television game of thrones is better
nottheonion,not_removed,that they said in boast we killed christ jesus the son of mary the messenger of allah but they killed him not nor crucified him but so it was made to appear to them and those who differ therein are full of doubts with no certain knowledge but only conjecture to follow for of a surety they killed him not the quaran seems pretty straight forward with the crucifixion to me
nottheonion,not_removed,we had the same issue with the pledge of allegiance anyone who abstained was told every morning that they could keep seated same school had us doing religious songs for music father abraham stands out as a regular one public school california late
nottheonion,not_removed,fwd fwd fwd fwd stannis is doing what it takes to protect us from the
nottheonion,not_removed,and that theyre all gonna give us their big cocks
nottheonion,not_removed,southern baptist is a denomination i live in the north
nottheonion,not_removed,i dunno i had a lot of texas friends who served and theyre the most racist hate filled people ive ever met one actually had to go to the er when i jokingly told him i saw the chick he was with last night in a hijab theyll all serve with people of other racereligions but they dont like it im positive of the guys spends a lot of time tracking other soldiers looking for ways to report them to get them discharged mightve worked a couple times too edit for those wanting the story on the hijab incident he thought he was having a heart attack but it turns out it was a panic attack he got super red in the face first accused me of lying then stared slinging slurs and saying this is how they get people theyre trying to breed us out honestly it was pretty funny how worked up he was until he called for an ambulance he went to the bathroom and closed the door raving and i didnt follow dunno at what point he called
nottheonion,not_removed,i think more generally cultures need to mix we need to be in any kind of situation where we get the opportunity to view people from other cultures being just like us
nottheonion,not_removed,very true basic forms friendship and breaks down preconceived notions of superiority something about all of us being equally worthless
nottheonion,not_removed,you could do this without mandatory military service but i like the core of the idea
nottheonion,not_removed,born in a garden and had no need for clothes clearly he was on the equator so maybe a little darker
nottheonion,not_removed,taupe
nottheonion,not_removed,right did it go up
nottheonion,not_removed,seitan
nottheonion,not_removed,for me it will always be leonard nimoy who said that
nottheonion,not_removed,i was unsure as to the exact wording thank you for clarifying
nottheonion,not_removed,its a good saying but incorrect several colors were available
nottheonion,not_removed,delorian made the out of stainless steel because the paint department is expensive he was saving money offering multiple colors would have been costly
nottheonion,not_removed,although you could get model ts in lots of colors
nottheonion,not_removed,i wish i could print posters of your comment and secretly tape them all over where i live saudi
nottheonion,not_removed,or whatever nirvana that they wait for buddhists dont generally try to force conformity a few extremists might sure but the general understanding is that if a person refuses to accept the notions of buddhism they will simply continue to be reincarnated and continue suffering its a selfinflicted punishment not a punishment by mob justice as members of the abrahamic religions seem to love dispensing
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt catcher in the rye pretty standard for high school literature classes never mind that probably increases the number of people lying about having red it not the other way around
nottheonion,not_removed,its the most unnecessary to lie about its not exactly long or inaccessible i can see people lying about lotr because they dropped it after five consecutive pages describing mushrooms or something but thats something you can read in like long dumps if you have it in the bathroom
nottheonion,not_removed,funny thing is most of the books you mentioned are pretty introductory basic material for general education literature classes either in high school or in college none of them are particularly impressive or at least they shouldnt be tell me you read chaucer for fun or that youre really into milton these days ill know youre lying but at least youre making the right effort with the lie
nottheonion,not_removed,i read the book in high school only because it was on the required curriculum i went back a few years after and reread it out of pure boredom by the time i got to the end of it i couldnt help but think about how fucked up the entire book was we can choose to look at it as well written literature or just a book but look at the bible koran or any other religious text slap a prophet on it call it divine and bam instant religion im not knocking organized religion but i do think bringing up is a good way to start the conversation about what freedom actually means
nottheonion,not_removed,percentagewise id say ulysees is up there lots of people had to read at school
nottheonion,not_removed,great now i will look like a douchebag if i do say i read and i really did
nottheonion,not_removed,i really should have referred to httpsenwikipediaorgwikidoublespeak in the context is a doubleedged sword if everyone reads it and gets it it is a great protection against the world it depicts if most people dont read it its a great instruction manual for reinforcing ignorance of proles
nottheonion,not_removed,this is a blanket statement for all belief groups
nottheonion,not_removed,believe me i know
nottheonion,not_removed,i prefer tzeentch for the changer of ways the architect of fate and great conspirator
nottheonion,not_removed,or helixianism praiseit
nottheonion,not_removed,i sincerely hold satire as a sacred expression
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah thing of it is while they can present the sincerely held beliefs hoop to jump through they cant really look too too closely at the actual substantive content of those beliefs because if they scrutinize pagan or madeup religions more than the flavors of jesus thats ridiculously easy pickins for a religiousdiscrimination suit and given how strong the religiousliberty protections have to be in order to protect christians the suit would be really easy to win if your sincerely held beliefs are at least consistent youre like of the way there if theyre written down in a bookeven a book you wrote under the inspiration of the true spirit of coursethen youre basically set they cant inquire too deeply into the content of your beliefs because then you could just turn around and say you believe that a jewish space zombie took on all your sins how is that any less ridiculous than my believing that trees have souls
nottheonion,not_removed,for the night is dark and full of terror
nottheonion,not_removed,brb gonna go burn my year old daughter
nottheonion,not_removed,geez i had not thought of that but composting would be like as sacrilegious as burning now that i think about it its slower more sustained more intentional ie once started the fire burns burns but the scriptures could be pulled out of a compost bin for a while yet and honestly more insulting burned pages are one thing but thats just destruction consider instead each every page becoming saturated with decaying organic matter slowly brimming with noxious bacteria dissolving the paper leather mold creeping over the surface like a delicate damning moss the horror of corruption rather than the relatively clean exit of annihilation shudder
nottheonion,not_removed,amazing how those two seem to fit together
nottheonion,not_removed,and terrorismmassacres
nottheonion,not_removed,and dressing like dilbert
nottheonion,not_removed,my dads family is southern baptist i cant even order a beer when we go out to eat together
nottheonion,not_removed,oh yeah they try to hide the fact that they didnt allow black priests until the and they get all pissy any time someone mentions polygamy
nottheonion,not_removed,but im talking how a lot of people literally dont even know that islam has any relation to jesus
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,your worship muaddib too water for all
nottheonion,not_removed,immortal technique
nottheonion,not_removed,universal truth is not measured in mass appeal
nottheonion,not_removed,not entirely some sects of judaism believe that the messianic age wont be one heralded by the coming of an individual just a period of time where everythings pretty chill everyone gets cool with everyone else and shittiness overall just kind of peters out
nottheonion,not_removed,so hes the savior messiah that throws satan into the lake of fire i dont know the details of islamic eschatology but i know its similar to christianity not the savior that erases sin from people right or does he also erase the sin but just isnt the son of god
nottheonion,not_removed,ah okay so you dont believe hes the son of god or that he is the one who allows people to be forgiven of sin then right but an official messenger and prophet of god
nottheonion,not_removed,but but we were there first shakes fist at martin luthers ghost
nottheonion,not_removed,i have met one catholic who didnt believe she was a christian
nottheonion,not_removed,my grandmother is still fighting the huguenot wars
nottheonion,not_removed,cynthia dunbar a lawyer from richmond who is a strict constitutionalist and thinks the nation was founded on christian beliefs managed to cut thomas jefferson from a list of figures whose writings inspired revolutions in the late century and century replacing him with st thomas aquinas john calvin and william blackstone jefferson is not well liked among conservatives on the board because he coined the term separation between church and state
nottheonion,not_removed,to be fair the christian view of jesus is considered blasphemy in islam too
nottheonion,not_removed,its that thing you get on top of mount panorama sometimes that makes the cars go all funny
nottheonion,not_removed,its whatever the opposite of australia is
nottheonion,not_removed,that thing that has showed up a few times in the last few days
nottheonion,not_removed,dad is that you
nottheonion,not_removed,m
nottheonion,not_removed,hitler on ice
nottheonion,not_removed,that would be spaceballs
nottheonion,not_removed,it took me all of three seconds to pull up a list of countries who have majority muslim populations and secular governments now does that mean that there is no intermingling between religion and government there no but i would also point out that the us has more religious involvement in its government than most western nations the point here is that your statement about islam always taking over governments is not true
nottheonion,not_removed,thats not what he said he said a bunch of christians from here went over and killed a bunch of muslims in iraq which is certainly true regardless of the reasons it really bothers me when people try to take the blame off the people doing the acts and place it all on the people giving the orders its insane hitmen mob enforcers nazi soldiers sailors on slave ships and so many other people just following orders allowed terrible things to happen and continue to do so if you carry out an immoral order youre just as immoral as the person giving the order
nottheonion,not_removed,and amazing woodworkers
nottheonion,not_removed,well we cant have you liking something on reddit httpwwwmarydemuthcombonnetsbuggiesandsexualabuse
nottheonion,not_removed,the amish catered my wedding and the food was sooo good and really affordable
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah but they make damn good pies
nottheonion,not_removed,the ending was kind of graphic though
nottheonion,not_removed,i believe its a talk show
nottheonion,not_removed,theres an anime about jesus and buddha being roommates and its pretty funny if youre into quirky japanese humor
nottheonion,not_removed,the bible does actually her hair is her covering corinthians but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering
nottheonion,not_removed,judaism was the original book christianity the blockbuster followup islam the third volume that sharply divides fan opinion and mormonism is badlywritten fan fiction not mine read it here years ago
nottheonion,not_removed,bearexit
nottheonion,not_removed,one actually had to go to the er when i jokingly told him i saw the chick he was with last night in a hijab what you mean he had a panic attack or something or he thinks theyre unclean i dont understand how even the most racist of idiots would need to go to the er over that
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah this idea that the military is a perfect meritocracy is an illusion plenty of bs politics and a lot of that can be racial a muslim recruit at parris island just committed suicide and theyre investigating his di for previous bad conduct toward minority recruits
nottheonion,not_removed,one actually had to go to the er when i jokingly told him i saw the chick he was with last night in a hijab story time
nottheonion,not_removed,suburban living destroys this
nottheonion,not_removed,scientists came up with what he would have looked like httpiimgurcomqcvrkjpg
nottheonion,not_removed,the nonstop campaign of hate and fearmongering badly damaged their fundraising efforts so the original plan of turning it into a muslim equivalent of a ymca had to be scrapped the mosque opened but stayed in the former warehouse unrenovated funny how theres a mosque even closer to ground zero that is older than even the wtc and nobody cared it was a political issue started by a republican running for office in ny he lost and after the election nobody cared
nottheonion,not_removed,most of it did then i think protests broke out and it shut down but i am not sure
nottheonion,not_removed,blessed are he who lie mangled by the bronze spear where is the bronze have to find bronze

nottheonion,not_removed,would have cut into his coke budget
nottheonion,not_removed,i wish you could too i suppose you could if you werent afraid of torture
nottheonion,not_removed,its more like a natural law than a punishment at all theres no great overseer who uplifts the good or punishes the nonbelievers its like claiming that gravity pulls us down to earth and through the study of aerospace engineering we can learn how to safely fly higher and higher until we can escape the earths gravity altogether gravity is not truly a punishment its a natural law that indirectly serves to punish those who try to make aircraft without a willingness to accept gravity or learn about and properly apply the knowledge of aerospace engineering
nottheonion,not_removed,actually thats a fair interpretation i like the how that sounds a good way to describe my nonbuddhism religion because our actions in this life determine our level of progression in the next
nottheonion,not_removed,it wasnt standard when i went through school in the and the local evangelical churches organized and petitioned the school board to have it removed from the curriculum and school libraries my curiosity later got the best of me and i read the part with the perverse act of sexual deviance that would corrupt the children leave it to southern baptists to see sexual deviance in the purely compassionate act of a woman with nothing feeding a man dying of starvation the only way she could
nottheonion,not_removed,it looks like this was a study done in england which is probably why citr is on there its pretty standard for american high schools
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know if every version of the book has it but my book has an appendix about how language in the world of is used to limit what people are allowed to think how to manipulate them what is newspeak doublespeak the reduction of grammar to simplify thoughts and so on its a really insightful read that has direct parallels with our own world
nottheonion,not_removed,trees they are us
nottheonion,not_removed,ists
nottheonion,not_removed,because of how well that worked out well for stannis baratheon

nottheonion,not_removed,in case anyone is httpsenwikipediaorgwikimountainmeadowsmassacre the mountain meadows massacre was a series of attacks on the baker–fancher emigrant wagon train at mountain meadows in southern utah the attacks began on september and culminated on september resulting in the mass slaughter of the emigrant party by members of the utah territorial militia from the iron county district together with some paiute native americans intending to leave no witnesses and thus prevent reprisals the perpetrators killed all the adults and older children—about men women and children in total seventeen children all younger than seven were spared
nottheonion,not_removed,and were victims of such things as well not an excuse just some context it kind of jacks people up when the governor signs an extermination order for your religious beliefs
nottheonion,not_removed,and hatred of gays
nottheonion,not_removed,how exactly do they try to hide that fact if the reversal is literally in their holy scripture for everyone to read
nottheonion,not_removed,correction mormons dont mind bringing up polygamy they get annoyed when jackasses say things like how many wives do you have ive never met a single mormon who doesnt mind talking about their polygamous heritage i had one lunatic polygamous ancestor murderer and another ancestor who had wives and children and was an awesome dude one wife ran the farm one wife ran the house and one wife ran the pharmacy i still find stories about him that confirm he was great
nottheonion,not_removed,pissy any time someone mentions polygamy well the practice was outlawed by the church in the so unless you meet a old mormon theyre only going to have wife
nottheonion,not_removed,they probably get confused by the fact that the arab muslims use a completely different name for jesus than the arab christians do
nottheonion,not_removed,yea and his point is christians act that way about your beliefs because they would rather believe you know nothing of jesus than to think jesus could be considered any less than the son of god
nottheonion,not_removed,the spice must flow ye the spice must flow imperium gotta go but the spice must flow hes muaddib his mind is active our usuls coming back to the sietch
nottheonion,not_removed,theres a jihad i could get behind bring the golden path
nottheonion,not_removed,hah yep
nottheonion,not_removed,i always get the messianic age and mesozoic era mixed up which one has velociraptors
nottheonion,not_removed,we believe only god can erase sin well not erase but forgive we dont have the concept of original sin in islam we believe everyone is born sinless ive been a muslim for years we also dont believe jesus was killed but that he was taken up to paradise before they killed him and will return to fight the antichrist and lead humanity alongside the mahdi and that he will die a natural death showing that showing that he is only human
nottheonion,not_removed,hes neither a sin eraser nor son of god in islam
nottheonion,not_removed,only christians believe hes the son of god and not even all christian denominations believe that
nottheonion,not_removed,muslims believe that jesus will descend and kill the antichrist and make supplication for the people of gog amp magog to be destroyed they believe he is not the son of god but a human as god has no offspring to him and doesnt resemble the creations in any way
nottheonion,not_removed,no of course not god has no associated partners offspring or fathers he is singular and as you say jesus did not die for mankinds sins man will answer for his sins with no intercessor between him and allah
nottheonion,not_removed,hey hey hey now dont forget about eastern orthodox christianity
nottheonion,not_removed,as a catholic there have been times that i dont want to be lumped in with groups that call themselves christian eg the ones who dont believe in evolution or booze
nottheonion,not_removed,i am a catholic but i am not a christian i am an atheist i just enjoy the rules and organization of mass also it makes my mother happy
nottheonion,not_removed,yep when asking who contributed more to century revolutions weve got thomas aquinas in one corner and the guy who wrote the declaration of independence in the otherhmmmwho should win this one
nottheonion,not_removed,id say the modern christian view of jesus is pretty blasphemous in christianity as well and by that i mean the american southern evangelical view
nottheonion,not_removed,to be fair both religions views on jesus will be blasphemous to the original disciples
nottheonion,not_removed,oh the apocalypticals either faith is absolutely sodden with them theyre the ones ruining it for everyone hey islam no one gives a shit about that stupid desert in the middle of nowhere hey televangelicals you cant force jesus to come back by aping prophecies
nottheonion,not_removed,kangaroos

nottheonion,not_removed,american servicemembers come form all religions and also none bushs methodist faith didnt make it a religious war a s much as he wanted it to
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree with you saying their acts are still immoral but the distinction of who the group is is important say the nazis were all protestants would you say the protestants murdered million jews no because thats ridiculous it was the nazi organization and doctrine that called for that not the protestant church the same way the japanese empire committed atrocities during not the shintoists
nottheonion,not_removed,and leather workers i have a leash for my dog that is amish made with a braided handle beautiful craftsmanship

nottheonion,not_removed,true unless if they get god morgan freeman to narrate
nottheonion,not_removed,easy there char
nottheonion,not_removed,have an upvote for the joke but thats not quite how it works in my religion we believe that all things in the world have a dual nature the earthmother gives them form and substance and the skyfather imbues them with the spirit the animating lifeforce everything including stuff wed normally regard as inanimate has a little spark of the spirit within it the major classifications roughly mirror the divisions of life with a couple extra ones thrown in animalia plantae fungi bacteria minerals and viruses souls persist from lifetime to lifetime becoming more or less complex in each iteration according to karma but apart from very rare exceptions a soul doesnt jump from one group to another you may well have been an insect thirty lifetimes ago but you probably werent a tree yes you read that right the rocks have souls very very very very very old and slowrunning souls ten thousand years to a rock is like the blink of an eye they possess deep and powerful wisdom and you can learn from them if you know how to listen
nottheonion,not_removed,the instigator of that massacre was my grandfather john d lee my mother says he was brilliant i read the same book about him that she read to me he just sounds like a lunatic
nottheonion,not_removed,oh so theyre religious
nottheonion,not_removed,what name
nottheonion,not_removed,im rapidly learning to love the muslim culture
nottheonion,not_removed,i think youre confused with the velocirapture
nottheonion,not_removed,those velociraptors knew how to throw a bar mitzvah and their claws came in handy at the bris
nottheonion,not_removed,well i know that the viking era is known for its abundance of laser raptors
nottheonion,not_removed,raptor jesus loves you
nottheonion,not_removed,ive been a muslim for years youre a buy low kinda guy huh
nottheonion,not_removed,the christian denominations that do believe that would have very stern words about the definition of christianity then
nottheonion,not_removed,for using the word intercessor
nottheonion,not_removed,which is fundamentally different from christianity according to christianity what you just said would be considered blasphemous
nottheonion,not_removed,they believe that jesus is actually god in human form
nottheonion,not_removed,alcohol
nottheonion,not_removed,please stop i can only get so erect
nottheonion,not_removed,youre exactly right im not saying that it would be fair to blame christianity for it although i wouldnt be at all surprised if there would have been more soldiers taking issue with their orders if they were being ordered to take action against a group of white christians i was mostly just responding to the guy for trying to put all of the blame on the government
nottheonion,not_removed,if you remember lotr you should probably not trust sean bean
nottheonion,not_removed,we just need to get rid of everyone whos souls are weighed down by gravity
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds like a lunatic after he found a band of secret murderers how exactly did this book make him fall from grace in your eyes
nottheonion,not_removed,jesus name in arabic is issa
nottheonion,not_removed,this is such a beautiful comment
nottheonion,not_removed,genius
nottheonion,not_removed,well that is kind of by definition since they are separate religions
nottheonion,not_removed,christianity is such a splintered religion these days some denominations dont even believe in the trinity thats one of the most hotly debated concepts even within single denominations
nottheonion,not_removed,alcoholic kangaroos
nottheonion,not_removed,its australia thats all the time unless youre talking about that one time every year where a bunch of blokes hang out on mount panorama to get pissed and then some mad cunts start racing their commos
nottheonion,not_removed,hey now he came through in the end
nottheonion,not_removed,he was a zealot way too passionate i was looking at his family history and it looks like he might have married women on the same day i think he was crazy about his religion and he was nervous that a group of settlers would move to the cedar valley absolutely gorgeous and judge them about their way of life so thats when he started trumping them eventually he made everyone feel like it was not only godsanctioned but churchsanctioned it was not so he rallied the troops killed the men women and older children and adopted the younger kids who could easily be assimilated to the new way of life let it be known that in no way does this man represent my religion if it did this would have happened a hell of a lot more often for the record im still a practicing mormon just a little more open minded than my mother my mom reads this story as a man who lived his life devoted to god and was pigeonholed as a scape goat from the start john d lee was just too righteous to do such a thing not my opinion obviously

nottheonion,not_removed,we butchered rabbits in primary school australia country town and we all enjoyed it went to high school in melbourne did something similar and kids freaked out country kids are heaps different to city kids
nottheonion,not_removed,they can teach a kid to butcher a moose but god forbid they get sex ed
nottheonion,not_removed,the one on the left is bored af
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean thats an essential skill in alaska
nottheonion,not_removed,from australia we get to learn how to dispose of bodies using tubs of acid
nottheonion,not_removed,alaska the most murrican part of america
nottheonion,not_removed,wait why is this sadly not the onionthats awesome d
nottheonion,not_removed,i loved living in alaska youre a lot more connected to nature up there i think its great for kids to get exposed to things like this it teaches them that their food came from a real animal it teaches them to respect food
nottheonion,not_removed,rhunting will appreciate this
nottheonion,not_removed,id pay good money to see a kindergartener take down a full grown moose and skin it on the spot
nottheonion,not_removed,that kid staring at the camera with a knife in his hand wearing sweatpants
nottheonion,not_removed,great skill to have
nottheonion,not_removed,not sure why this is in rnottheonion this is a great skill to have
nottheonion,not_removed,when i worked in a school one of the teachers brought in a dead baby pig and a few cow organs she got from the butchers the kids really liked it and i think it does them good to have a better understanding on that sort of stuff
nottheonion,not_removed,was this class taught by dwight schrute
nottheonion,not_removed,id like to see a source on that cause i feel like youre pulling my leg here
nottheonion,not_removed,for you
nottheonion,not_removed,this shitty article failed to mention that the whole school participated
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe they didnt pass the first time or fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth
nottheonion,not_removed,if the city kids learned how delicious the little buggers are maybe australia would have fewer rabbits
nottheonion,not_removed,i think learning to feed your family before learning to create one is a good idea
nottheonion,not_removed,my chemist teacher taught us that too after he got lung cancer
nottheonion,not_removed,i lived there for grade i do recall one camping trip for about days not a weekend but we were in cabins and ate hot dogs and stuff there was a survival class that you took once a year things about how to stay alive in the cold and such grade year we did go out with our survival class teacher in the middle of winter learned how to ice fish build basic traps and i think he skinned a beaver long time ago but i remember something with beavers there was never anything crazy like going out with only a coffee can for a weekend but maybe the schools on the reservations did do that
nottheonion,not_removed,i did this in grade in ketchikan ak there were three levels to the yearly survival trip toughies regulars and wimps i cant recall what the last group was actually called but thats how we kids referred to them toughies were brought out to an island cove with only their clothes and what the could fit in a small coffee can the contents of the coffee can had to include a smallish sheet of plastic for use in a shelter and fire starting material no lighters any space left in the can was reserved for tools like knives and whatever food you could fit most kids packed their equipment in the can and filled the voids with rice a chaperone came along to make sure no one died and to prevent any lord of the flies situations regulars got to bring a big coffee can and a larger plastic sheet wimps just went to a local campground and slept in tents most of the semester there were lessons in science classes on hypothermia and local food sources we had gym periods where we learned to start fires using only matches to qualify for toughies you had to demonstrate that you could start a fire with a single match two matches got you into regulars and any more put you with the wimps ketchikan is a very rainy place surrounded by ocean and people die from hypothermia in survival situations almost every year its also common there for kids as young as to have their own skiff for fishing and toying around on the water teaching survival techniques to kids helps prepare them for situations where they would likely end up dead otherwise im on mobile and need to get back to work so no link but if you google schoenbar middle school survival trip you should be able to find a news article or two on it
nottheonion,not_removed,do you know about the australian walkabout
nottheonion,not_removed,i was told by a guide while in alaska didnt press for a source since he was a guide and we talked to a working with him that confirmed it
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe australia would have giant venomous rabbits ftfy
nottheonion,not_removed,i always upvote common sense
nottheonion,not_removed,kids are allowed one backpack with camping gear extra clothes and a survival kit — a threepound coffee tin stuffed with firestarters twine aluminum foil compass rice soap basic first aid supplies and fishing line and hooks so it looks like they get a bit more than indicated but still it would be hard if you had no idea
nottheonion,not_removed,every school should do this
nottheonion,not_removed,they make alaskan kids do a walkabout in australia the education system there is metal as fuck
nottheonion,not_removed,so a tour guide the most reliable of sources
nottheonion,not_removed,we already have thousands of lethal organisms in australia any more wouldnt hurt
nottheonion,not_removed,should have mentioned that i went in the early it may have changed since then edit my memory may have failed me extra clothes and the tarp went in a backpack that was inspected before the trip

nottheonion,not_removed,those things are no joke they know hyper fang
nottheonion,not_removed,i recall a story my teacher told us his friend was driving across a bridge when he struck a beaver with his truck he pulled over and got out of his truck approaching the animal to find it still alive naturally it began chasing him back his truck as he climbed in it latched on to his lower back so he began slamming it against the truck and the railing on the bridge he ended up having to body slam the beaver to dislodge it before fleeing to his truck as he drove away the beaver got up and briefly gave chase for several metres before walking off the moral of the story is dont mess with beavers theyll fuck you up
nottheonion,not_removed,oh damn he probably nicked the femoral artery thatll kill you quick youre unconscious in four minutes and dead in twelve
nottheonion,not_removed,watched it before many lols were had

nottheonion,not_removed,shame they never got to experience having one from prior to the hostess sellout whatever they did now has them dry and stale tasting used to be a bit buttery moist and sweet a texture close to that of really fresh angelfood cake even though its vanillabased flavor was mostly its own the current ones really taste like disappointment particularly if you knew how they were supposed to be

nottheonion,not_removed,california effective tax rate is for someone making that much money so his after tax earnings are so hes spending about of his income on rent for a bedroom with kids you dont really want to be paying more than of your after tax income in rent in case you get laid off so this is pretty much maxed out for the engineer in most areas of the country if you want more space you can move out of the city but unless you are willing to move far away enough that your commute is hours long you simply cant afford anything better plus it is not atypical for rent to jump every year its not that engineers feel poor its that with all this money they feel like they should be able to do things like buy a house or buy a condo or things like that what makes this very sad is that because this is how engineers feel nontechies are forced into those severalhourlong commutes pointing this as a wealth bubble is over simplifying the problem since the relative lack of construction especially for affordable housing limits everyones choices lack of solid public transport in the area exacerbates the commute problem and nimby people keep anything from changing

nottheonion,not_removed,it is a hyperbole the options might be cheaper but not by much for breakfast still seems absurd

nottheonion,not_removed,im sure someone making much less than you would call you stuck up privileged and unaware of hardships everyone thinks that anyone earning more than them somehow doesnt have real problems
nottheonion,not_removed,where do you live
nottheonion,not_removed,fyi relative poverty is generally defined as having a household disposable income of less than of the national media income for the usa this means having a household disposable income of less after just rent this puts you in relative poverty and this isnt even factoring in taxes heating food health insurance etc as a side note id be pissed off if i had to pay more than of my income on housing
nottheonion,not_removed,have you considered the difference in cost for lunch at a food court or groceries at the local supermarket if that meal is for lunch in the bay area where it would be where you live for the exact same thing then the dollar amounts kind of matter cooking is an option of course unless the bay area people are working hour days and end up relying on eating out just spitballing here

nottheonion,not_removed,if people avoided children until they had a secured home wed all be sterile before considering kids
nottheonion,not_removed,theres also a basic economic principal that shows subsidies raise prices all other things equal vis same number of consumers and suppliers show up to market with more cash in their pockets prices go up research has shown that this is likely whats at play in american higher education the cost of tuition has risen linearly with the supply of cash to fafsa the best way to make college cheaperfrom this standpointmight be to stop requiring a college education for many jobs and shut down fafsa which of course is politically very very difficult and possibly would be more harmful to society than simply allowing student debt to continue to eat away at peoples sense of equanimity yikes no easy solutions

nottheonion,not_removed,ive seen the results of programmers working in silos never talking to their coworkers you dont have to not talk to coworkers or not talk to customers that doesnt mean you have to live full time in the same apartment complex as them it does take a degree of discipline ill grant
nottheonion,not_removed,ia ia cthulu goto
nottheonion,not_removed,need them to actually like to communicate with each other then it becomes quite pleasant dont hire with the antisocial nerd stereotype in mind remember answering those stupid questions your coworkers have is part of your job which is to get the software out the damn door you are cultivating more brains and hands on keyboards to get more shit done than you could ever do alone still best with sit down and grind days which are great for work from home
nottheonion,not_removed,the company does the majority of the employees dont
nottheonion,not_removed,so his after tax earnings are after taxes and housing costs hes playing with nearly of income that is a huge amount of money what he has left after taxes and housing is more than the median household in the us makes before taxes sorry all signs point to a high earner with poor money management skills
nottheonion,not_removed,i think there might be a keeping up with the joneses factor here im pulling in kids half that suckers rent thanks to rent control but my wife well the most she could probably hope to make is about so she just runs a side business and takes care of the kids meanwhile most of our friends with kids have two tech incomes which means theyre making or more
nottheonion,not_removed,so hes spending about of his income on rent for a bedroom with kids no one forced him to have kids
nottheonion,not_removed,yea high rises would go up everywhere if they let it the area shouldve turned into something like new york city a long time ago
nottheonion,not_removed,he better pray his job isnt outsourced
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah but that doesnt really apply if his biggest cost is his rent what else could there be the only other big expenses that arent totally discretionary would be stuff like cartransport kids education health insurance if not provided food utilities etc theyve already saidimplied that each of these categories must be under

nottheonion,not_removed,sign me up trouble is most of these dumbfucks have bought into the rat race hard and actually idolize the wealthy they worship them and their expensive social status symbols shit needs to burn
nottheonion,not_removed,are you feeling insecure about something not really life is pretty good those are some sweeping generalizations to be throwing around im not gonna put in the effort to carve out exceptions and qualify my statement when doing so will just result in someone else nit picking my point is that the sv engineer who cant get by is a group of people who are effectively making a tradeoff like our example guy who lives in a trailer but drives a vette theyre putting up with a whole bunch of shit and running a ratrace for some perceived benefit that sv gives them just like vette guy puts up with the downsides to living in a trailer park in exchange for whatever benefit driving a vette confers they just dont see it that way so theyre complaining about it if vette guy complained theyd be quick to point out that hes making a tradeoff nobody would write articles about how woe is him nor would anybody write articles about that guy that lives in the boondocks in nevada works remote four days a week and drives to sv and sleeps in his van the other day hes making a conscious tradeoff
nottheonion,not_removed,whats wrong with that sure i get it you want a kid have a kid but kids
nottheonion,not_removed,well or they could make colleges decrease tuition iirc a lot are run by the state and even the private ones still get a lot of subsidies its not even necessary to force them but the state could tie subsidies to decreased tuition eg if tuition is decreased by the state increase subsidies by sure that might cost some money but its also a way to carefully deflate a bubble that might crash the economy
nottheonion,not_removed,you were sooooo close iä iä cthulhu fhtagn goto
nottheonion,not_removed,what you think its just as sexy to have like a couple offices for the or whatever in the c suite and all the employees working remotely as it would be to have the an office overlooking some bustling activity like this nah man its much sexier
nottheonion,not_removed,yea regardless of his rent to income proportion the guy still has more disposable income than many families
nottheonion,not_removed,if i could save up in a month oh buddy id have a car and have my years rent paid in like months all on top of being able to eat
nottheonion,not_removed,he has two children where do they attend school what are his childcare arrangements i agree that should be enough to live on but there are unavoidable costs and everything is more expensive when the cost of living is so high
nottheonion,not_removed,utility bills savings food clothing schooling is nothing in the bay area
nottheonion,not_removed,if theyre crying poor because they have to spend more than most people earn in a year on affluent status symbols then theyve got nobody to blame but themselves
nottheonion,not_removed,soyoure arguing that only the rich should be allowed to reproduce
nottheonion,not_removed,so of disposable income per month after taxes and health insurance i only take home per month now try doing all those other deductions i feel absolutely zero sympathy for that person i also love how they the in that his wife could only get a job in the range so that wouldnt be enough when i know tons of people in the range who would literally kill someone for a a year job but as stated above it may be a keeping up with the jones mentality holding them back
nottheonion,not_removed,oh only in fully disposable income a year thats only enough to invest then buy a new computer for every family member each year at a pop then drop into college savings for both kids a year then pay for a week or two vacation for and still have leftover to pop out for a showing of hamilton nearby so they are cultured my heart bleeds for this familys ability to save money buy brand new tech toys pay for college attend popular events and go on vacation they are barely scraping by

nottheonion,not_removed,about total for that income in this area so hes down to a month just from takes then rent puts him at for food water electricity childrens school andor daycare medical expenses gas etc all in all it can be difficult to make ends meet much less have any money left over for enjoying your life
nottheonion,not_removed,most of his taxes arent going to dod coffers
nottheonion,not_removed,im not saying that they are poor just saying that since everything is so artificially inflated they can live a better life for half in a cheaper area
nottheonion,not_removed,the thing is that rent is the only thing being more than httpssmartassetcommortgagewhatisthecostoflivinginsanfrancisco more expensive than in the rest of the country hence calling these people poor is still very much nonsense true their income doesnt place them even remotely as high as it would in other areas of the us but theyre still very much middle class
nottheonion,not_removed,while he didnt word it well you arent poor making a week even in silicon valley state income tax is really high and everything is more expensive but there is still equivalent to something like in a place like chicago far from poor
nottheonion,not_removed,oh so i guess that means they have to buy the most expensive plan and every single insurance possible just because they can afford it just so they can cry about how much they dont get paid even though dollars a week isnt enough its called money management something they and the rest of the downvoters obviously never heard about because there is now possible way he is spending a week on bills and food dont you think thats a little stupid no matter where you live
nottheonion,not_removed,ive never been to silicon valley but i cant imagine theyd buy something for that much if there really was a cheaper alternative
nottheonion,not_removed,how
nottheonion,not_removed,to me living comfortably is also having a healthy savings account the reason why the guy working in the tech industry felt poor was because he couldnt save
nottheonion,not_removed,fair enough you are in the tiny minority of actually good people with perspective
nottheonion,not_removed,hah but really the intended meaning was about how the age for a stable living situation in which to raise children is towards the upper end of the childbearing age for couples
nottheonion,not_removed,your image is broken i know a number of people who run their own businesses who rent fancy offices for about one week a month to meet clients and otherwise work from home i myself worked at a company where the ceo realized hed never get all the talent he needed in one place so for the first several years up to about employees no two employees had the same telephone area code it took discipline but it served me well to learn how to do that its harder when you have a large company and a number of jobs really need to be in an office we found that by the time you get five or so customer service reps highspeed communication is important enough to have them centralized for example nathaniel borenstein did a paper about first virtual holdings inc that made public the lessons learned altho im not trivially finding it in spite of having found it online before
nottheonion,not_removed,whats the mime type o aint nobody got time fo yo magic numbers bullshit
nottheonion,not_removed,but he is also one of the hoghest paid he shouldnt have to worry about that at all imo the bay area is a cluster fuck and a money pit left over after taxes and rent gets you no where
nottheonion,not_removed,sure but where do you live my work affords me enough to live like a king in tulsa ok but here in san diego im paycheck to paycheck
nottheonion,not_removed,the whole problem is that if you were living in sfsv you would have much higher rent so you wouldnt be able to cover a years rent with a month of takehome pay your comment is like saying if my aunt were a man id have like two gay uncles
nottheonion,not_removed,probably private school
nottheonion,not_removed,schooling for children is free most americans have no savings clothing is a few hundred dollars a year food is a couple hundred a month
nottheonion,not_removed,no he has every right to have as many kids as he wants he has the right to have kids if he wants not that its a financially pragmatic idea
nottheonion,not_removed,with so many people in actual poverty i have no idea how we got to a point where were supposed to feel bad for someone who has to spend at will every month
nottheonion,not_removed,allegedly those technguys love adderall could be that too
nottheonion,not_removed,lsd i actually read an article saying that micro dosing lsd helped their creativity
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a place in a pretty ritzy part of town rents have finally started stabilizing and even falling a little here a normal place will be about with some of the older or less conveniently located buildings down to now
nottheonion,not_removed,my three year old building in mission bay has a bedroom unit available now for
nottheonion,not_removed,rich definitely not difficult to make ends meet oh come on food water electricity school stuff for the kids and gas should still be no where near a month lol it should be noted that if he has a family with kids the effective tax rate will be substantially lower than given the deductions and tax credits
nottheonion,not_removed,and somehow people are living on of that money there are restaurants in the area do you think all the burger king cashiers and restaurant dishwashers are making per year
nottheonion,not_removed,my pge is about in slow months and in dead winter and summer too everything costs way more here
nottheonion,not_removed,but the jobs are not in the cheaper areas so everyone is in the same boat good job expensive standard of living average job average standard of living i still feel like it comes off entitled for them to think they deserve a better standard of living because their income is higher
nottheonion,not_removed,its not just rent though its the general cost of living too
nottheonion,not_removed,well rent control and home ownership mean there are a ton of people paying well below market rate in addition its not that hard to get by as a young person making well below six figures you just need roommates and you probably wont be living in the hippest part of town supporting kids is a totally different story of course median household income in sf is about so your average resident is not making anywhere near these huge salaries
nottheonion,not_removed,this is an area of interest to me so imma definitely check it out thanks
nottheonion,not_removed,people are living in the bay area on a month before taxes
nottheonion,not_removed,exactly
nottheonion,not_removed,left over after taxes and rent gets you no where maybe not in silicon valley but gets you a lot somewhere else
nottheonion,not_removed,i live in the middle of the midwest p so even here is a damn decent income
nottheonion,not_removed,in silicon valley food for a family of is more like a month gas depends on you cat and commute but can easily be a month school is free if you comfortable with the public schools but in the shit neighborhoods that not an option for some plus a lot of those high paying jobs want you to work hours a week with a long commute parents doing that means almost a full time nanny you just cant compare middle america to the bay area the realities are soooo far apart
nottheonion,not_removed,exactly i would absolutely love to have disposable income per month hell even an extra per month would really ease up the ends and would never have to worry about them not meeting for me
nottheonion,not_removed,my wife and i have about leftover every month after our bills are paid i know how quick that money can go when you buy little things here and there eat out when you dont feel like cooking download that game you might only play once etc but spending your extra income needlessly is a choice you make yourself budget well and have a little self control with that you can easily save a nice chunk of your extra income while still enjoying your life we all wish we made more money but anybody who pisses away thousands of dollars of income that isnt needed for bills doesnt need more income just because theyre irresponsible
nottheonion,not_removed,i heard they snort gigabytes
nottheonion,not_removed,but thats still cheap especially if they get a prescription covered through insurance cocaines how you easily spend a couple hundred in a night
nottheonion,not_removed,aderoll is like a pill so many kids get it over prescribed that it floods the market everywhere
nottheonion,not_removed,lsd is relatively cheap when youre not microdosing
nottheonion,not_removed,in california
nottheonion,not_removed,the issue with that if the kids are young then odds are no family are nearby so one would expensive child care in city ive seen rates of a month in expensive cities
nottheonion,not_removed,food water electricity school stuff for the kids and gas should still be no where near a month lol do you live in silicon valley
nottheonion,not_removed,and somehow people are living on of that money there are restaurants in the area do you think all the burger king cashiers and restaurant dishwashers are making per year no theyre living in condemned buildings and theyre the ones who were homeless when we flooded last week
nottheonion,not_removed,or maybe just the system is broken because the ceos and top execs still get to keep all the money no matter where you live
nottheonion,not_removed,cities like austin and atlanta are really cheap compared to other cities and have tons of programming jobs
nottheonion,not_removed,and is youre only choice to pack up and move youre family to a less expensive place thats gentrification my friends they make us think thats what we should do instead of fighting for what amounts to a a respectable living wage for the level of our education
nottheonion,not_removed,yes i know i looked that up and linked it food groceries not eating out is more expensive for example most other things are probably similarly more expensive some more eating out some less anything that you buy on the national market eg online thats significant but not even remotely enough to make someone making six figures poor if your after rent income is in the bay area that will probably feel like in an average place fyi the median household income in the us was in httpssmartassetcommortgagewhatisthecostoflivinginsanfrancisco
nottheonion,not_removed,what does not the hippest part of town mean i visit sf pretty often i have yet to find a part of town that isnt expensive there seem to be expensive neighrborhoods and then ludicrously expensive neighborhoods how many roommates are we talking i didnt realize there was that much rent control but old people with homes theyve owned forever makes some sense i suppose lucky mofos
nottheonion,not_removed,it occurs to me that if you wander around fvcom in archiveorg near the end of its existence timeframe or so youll likely find the paper even if google cant find it for you
nottheonion,not_removed,no i am saying that even if the highest paid are struggling there is a major issue
nottheonion,not_removed,hes saying that no one should feel theyre scraping by and the fact that a earner feels that way shows just how bad the situation is
nottheonion,not_removed,true but not very helpful for the individual living in silicon valley
nottheonion,not_removed,yea and thats why sv housing is in crisis housing should not cost as much as it does in the bay area
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah but in bay area the choice is making k a year to add to a high tax bracket more like after taxonly to have to pay in nannie care the point is that voice sucks balls
nottheonion,not_removed,i think you have the wrong impression a microdose is a fraction of a single hit of lsd usually a quarter hit or less even if hes microdosing a few times a week it shouldnt cost him more than bucks a month even if he has the worst connection ever if hes buying in bulk a microdose is maybe a dollar
nottheonion,not_removed,do i need to
nottheonion,not_removed,outer avenues south side of town ingleside portola excelsior etc western addition the seedy parts of soma a lot of the rooms available on craigslist are cheaper than market because theyre in apartments with leases locked in years ago i know a lot of people paying in the range for roommates theyre not all in those outer neighborhoods but theyre not on and valencia either you can check out roomsshares on cl its not all that hard to find a room especially on the higher end of thay range getting your friends together for a new lease is different and will run at minimum although you dont have to hit figures to swing that
nottheonion,not_removed,why dont they just move further away where it isnt as ridiculously expensive and use a wheeled vehicle to commute
nottheonion,not_removed,i understand fully you can macro lsd for cheap so its even cheap when you arent micro dosing
nottheonion,not_removed,theres the difference ca has a huge income tax and state disability insurance wa doesnt have any state income taxes or sdi
nottheonion,not_removed,just to give you an idea of the difference my husbands company moved us from silicon valley to wa he took a costofliving pay cut for the exact same position because its so much more expensive to live in silicon valley than in wa we were paying for a crappy in a horrible neighborhood in santa clara and for slightly less money in wa we have a beautiful home
nottheonion,not_removed,my point is that your conceptualization of living costs is highly affected by where you live if you live somewhere that has a far lower cost of living that silicon valley then expenses here are going to shock you now do you live in an area economically comparable to silicon valley
nottheonion,not_removed,lucky as fuck damn isnt the city still pretty expensive to live in though
nottheonion,not_removed,and btw i do have to use a motorcycle to commute
nottheonion,not_removed,the costofliving differences is insane just from reading all of these comments im in the midwest making and it is enough to provide for my family wife stays at home with children i pay half of your former rent cost in mortgage for my house sure times are occasionally rough but i sometimes have to slap myself when seeing the income people make on the west coast its all relative
nottheonion,not_removed,i live in toronto while not as expensive as silicon valley its still comparable except for rent and even if i didnt this information is easily attainable and one does not have to live there to know how expensive or inexpensive the cost of living is
nottheonion,not_removed,oh absolutely its insanely expensive i didnt mean to imply otherwise just saying there are a lot of people here not getting the techfinancemedical salaries and they are making it in various ways that population will continue to decrease over time though my guess is what well see more and more in the future is younger people willing to accept relatively crappy living situations for the worksocial opportunities the city provides while only the rich remain as they get older basically what has happened in manhattan
nottheonion,not_removed,the example they gave is a bit extreme i live not far from seattle and have a house a block away from waternot that its particularly desirable wa beaches are cold and pay for my mortgage i work for a defense contractor so im on the lower end of salaries but its still nearly double what i would make in a midwestern state seattle itself and the immediate surrounding area is expensive but when you get to tacoma everett or kitsap countyferry ride away the housing prices are pretty much cut in half and there are still well paying employers in those areas so the commute isnt necessary california blows and high costs suck there but in the seattle area finances can be manageable what blows is the weather

nottheonion,not_removed,constriction effect like bursting a watermelon with rubber bands
nottheonion,not_removed,best way to free the man get a pair of scissors and then eucalyptus rope thats tied around his hands
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds somewhat similar to another case i dont remember names or what state an older man whose home was broken into multiple times hid his car away from the house to make it seem he wasnt home when the two teens entered his home he was hiding in the basement with the lights off and a tarp on the floor as they came down the stairs he shot them and dragged them to the tarp where he shot them both multiple times and they died i think it was thanksgiving because he waited until the next day to tell anyone because he said he didnt want to bother anyone on the holiday this case doesnt seem like intentional homicide although i do question why he covered the guys mouth usually that is done so no one can hear them scream
nottheonion,not_removed,likely or the tape he wrapped around his mouth suffocated him

nottheonion,not_removed,yea the things going on there make people cry
nottheonion,not_removed,ive been looking at the facebook page and it looks like people who live there are constantly checking in to the apartments on facebook and documenting everything as a way to mock them its quite funny theres one guy whos checked in several times simply saying home
nottheonion,not_removed,okay folks we hope you like your new apartment and dont forget to like share and subscribe
nottheonion,not_removed,xpost from rnews forgot to put in title
nottheonion,not_removed,beyond the obvious reasons this is shortsighted and stupid theres a big issue about privacy being vital to some tenants you could have people trying to keep where they live unknown to abusive expartners or people that work in law enforcement that dont want their name in the friends list of this building
nottheonion,not_removed,fuck that for a joke
nottheonion,not_removed,oh mani live pretty close to these apartments gonna have to follow this story and see what kind of shenanigans ensuebecause they will
nottheonion,not_removed,and it has gone viral now the page is being bombed with star reviews
nottheonion,not_removed,i work in property management they probably want an easy way to post building announcements bylaw amendments annual cleanings etc this is actually a good alternative to the way many buildings do it some send klunky pdf attachments or websites where you need special passwords to learn that garbage pick up is now on tuesday settle down folks
nottheonion,not_removed,if i was stuck and couldnt move id create a special facebook just for this shit

nottheonion,not_removed,ex battle creature here seems fitting to read about it in this sub lol
nottheonion,not_removed,former bcr checking in indeed there was a time once long ago when the only weirdness was happening behind the rock cafe now its full on madness

nottheonion,not_removed,oponions
nottheonion,not_removed,a parfait has layers
nottheonion,not_removed,hey how is a police force supposed to justify their budget if theyre not jailing people for spurious offences
nottheonion,not_removed,precedent is that when there is true story that goes further than the onion story then it gets posted here yes reality often decides that the onion isnt silly enough
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe one of them or both needed that onion for their sub
nottheonion,not_removed,a sub with onions
nottheonion,not_removed,although onions do go well on subs
nottheonion,not_removed,i remember someone saying that but cant remember what its from
nottheonion,not_removed,with rice
nottheonion,not_removed,tell that to the arguing father and son it was the onion they were arguing about
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe its a typo and the father and son are chemists fighting over anions
nottheonion,not_removed,woosh
nottheonion,not_removed,i prefer cucumbers on my subs instead of onions
nottheonion,not_removed,and jared fogel
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,after reading the article i think it was the crack cocaine they were arguing about the onion in question was mostly like the last straw
nottheonion,not_removed,definitely fits rule
nottheonion,not_removed,i prefer potatoes
nottheonion,not_removed,he takes his women like he takes his subs and
nottheonion,not_removed,it was actually not a straw but the last onion
nottheonion,not_removed,ill settle for a little karma on top
nottheonion,not_removed,the last onion straw those things are great on burgers
nottheonion,not_removed,it really depends on your mindset going into the burger if youre enjoying life and having a good day then the last onion straw on the burger is often just the final burst of that delicious oniony flavor that can push a good burger over the edge into great burger territory and really cement that burger as a flavor champion thatll be remembered for at least three to four minutes but if youre currently struggling through life barely mustering the effort required to lift your head every morning slogging through the endless repetitive grind that is life trying to punch you until you cant take it anymore that last onion straw is just another reminder that everything is transitory and ephemeral and that one day you too will be nothing more than a bitter aftertaste in the mouth of someone much more important and influential than you are and that youll never create anything that will last long enough for anyone to give even the faintest iota of a shit about it fuck onion straws
nottheonion,not_removed,dodo you need to talk
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah i feel like the latter recently hey at least theres alcohol
nottheonion,not_removed,the political situation in the us is really really getting to me right now im fine though thank you for asking
nottheonion,not_removed,going by the article this just reads like an updated verion of the lonely hearts ads from back in the day actually i find it rather sweet in a sad kind of way
nottheonion,not_removed,the single white man describes himself as caring compassionate considerate dependable detailed gentle intelligent loyal outspoken reasonable touchyfeely trustworthy and witty just gonna throw that in there huh
nottheonion,not_removed,he seems to be more honest than some people are on dating apps i say good luck to him
nottheonion,not_removed,free wifi free rent a smoke free household a bathroom all to myself and help with credit history if i was within travel distance and happened to have a different gender id be all over this if its legitimate that is
nottheonion,not_removed,unfortunately these kind of posts are increasingly common
nottheonion,not_removed,i like it be honest no games come out and be yourself and let people know what you are offering
nottheonion,not_removed,i like how honest and direct he is about what he wants but hes going to attract a parasite
nottheonion,not_removed,i hope he finds what he is looking for
nottheonion,not_removed,why is this news
nottheonion,not_removed,if i was and single i might
nottheonion,not_removed,he must be a real catch if this is how hes going about it
nottheonion,not_removed,its very sweet and romantic until youre in a hole in his basement being told to put the lotion on your skinunless youre into that sort of stuff
nottheonion,not_removed,if it wasnt already creepy before that sentence did the trick
nottheonion,not_removed,well he did say he was detailed
nottheonion,not_removed,i know i was just about the say the same thing
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean what is there to fall for it seems pretty straight forward
nottheonion,not_removed,why exactly is it not legit
nottheonion,not_removed,i disagree he is probably lonely older man doesnt drink a lot hard to meet women he probably just wants someone to share the rest of his life with
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah people do this all of the time it isnt some uncommon thing
nottheonion,not_removed,he makes himself out to be a great dude its possible but doubtful maybe im wrong but the whole article just wreaked of creepy
nottheonion,not_removed,its pretty much whats up with my wife i work i keep the wifi working
nottheonion,not_removed,its possible given his age that maybe hes getting out of a bad marriage or something and is desperate for companionship that said the whole be with me i have hbo and will take out your garbage shtick combined with his laundry list of positive qualities like finding three different words for caring tells the story of a man who is probably at best pretty socially awkward and at worst an unpleasant person desperately attempting to mask the fact by raiding his thesaurus like hes all those good things and people still dont want to fuck or date him thats a tough cookie to swallow even if hes physically unattractive plenty of women out there dont care that much about that sort of thing and would totally go with a guy whos fugly if he makes up for it with humor and confidence and intelligence or whatever gets your motor running
nottheonion,not_removed,the story of a man who is probably at best pretty socially awkward yeah god forbid if so much as one socially awkward person who cant seem to find any success by going down the conventional route finally secures some companionship one way or another who cares about the whole pursuit of happiness thing when you can cleverly point out that some people might be a tad different
nottheonion,not_removed,cherry pick my post if you will but it wont help our romeo find his star crossed hbo partner
nottheonion,not_removed,what someone suffering from alcoholism needs is support and treatment to get better from their addiction – which can be provided – not to be euthanised she added did this lady not read about this case like at all he went to rehab times and was getting help for years its really strange to me that some people have this attitude that you have to keep living no matter what even if youre suffering horribly as somebody who had an alcoholic family member i would rather he had applied for euthanasia and died surrounded by his family members instead of wandering into the woods all alone to hang himself
nottheonion,not_removed,holy fuck i wish we could do this in the us how many times ive been sent to the laughing factory how many times phop has been notified of another attempt my parents being called being sent to a different rehab in a different state its not a joke some of us want this
nottheonion,not_removed,and to think ive just been using my alcoholism as slow suicide
nottheonion,not_removed,would they rather him wrap his lips around the barrel of a gun
nottheonion,not_removed,punished for lack of selfcontrol
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont understand how you could read this and for your takeaway to be just further proof we shouldnt have euthanasia

nottheonion,not_removed,honestly i probably wouldve checked out long ago if it had been a convenient option instead i have about nine and a half years clean i say keep fighting it
nottheonion,not_removed,is the nothingness felt prior to birth really better than sensation of any kind
nottheonion,not_removed,thatd be quite a feat to get your hand on a gun as an alcoholic depressed person in the netherlands
nottheonion,not_removed,in what twisted world is that punishment punishment would be forcing him to live his life when he no longer wants to
nottheonion,not_removed,as others have said in this thread for this guy it would have either been euthenasia or someone would have found him two weeks later hanging in his closet if you dont give people a peaceful option for ending their own suffering theyll find a less peaceful way of doing so
nottheonion,not_removed,i say let people choose rather than forcing them and who said it had to be convenient isnt it like a multimonth long process in the states where its legal
nottheonion,not_removed,its not nothingness vs sensation of any kind its more of an option between releaserelief vs painsuffering when you have issues like that be it from substance abuse living situation or mental health problems you dont really have any kind of sensation except the negative to the point where positive thought seems naive and a set up for failure every action you take just feels like another mistake so to answer the original question yes nothingness can be better to sensation of any kind especially when the only sensation youre getting is negative and painful edited first line was a bit aggressive when rereading
nottheonion,not_removed,its more of never quite figuring out how to live in my own skin and then piling years of shit onto it and then amplify it with survivors guilt after deployment and constantly thinking people know that i am alive instead of someone more deserving a complete release of emotion a final exhale and relaxing of mindbody that i desperately crave the waking up every morning and laying in bed for min trying to figure out if this is still a dream or if i am awake again into a new day of nightmares gets old the drinking and drugs broken engagements and failed marriage loss of my child loss of my closest friend abandonment issues coupled with severe self loathing
nottheonion,not_removed,where there is a will theres a way and im sure hed find the way
nottheonion,not_removed,as a former addict i would say it takes a good years of sobreity untill your brain function begins to return to normal its like a veil being lifted after years of self abuse the person i was then is not the person i am now i would even argue that i was not in control of my own actions due to the nature of the disease the same could be said for this man
nottheonion,not_removed,its not nothingness vs sensation of any kind huh maybe you misunderstood me when you are dead you experience nothing think about what you felt before you were born nothing when you are alive sure you experience pain suffering substance abuse mental health issues failure or whatever you want to call it but that doesnt change the simple fact that suicide is choosing to feel nothing over what you are feeling now which is something you cant even say that killing yourself brings release or relief you know when you feel releaserelief after you find out the lump on your testicles isnt cancer you dont feel the release or relief while the doctor is thumbing your testicles if you watch your girlfriend get hit by a car while crossing the street you dont experience relief while youre running over to her motionless body you experience relief after she starts to stand up and say im totally fine you also dont feel relief while you are killing yourself you pull the trigger kick the chair down the pills or whatever and then you are dead but the feeling of relief never comes there is absolutely no room for debate here i explicitly left out slitting your wrists an example above because that obviously causes a rush of endorphins but the point remains you dont feel release from your real pain ever its over you die if you just want to feel the type of release that slitting your wrists gives you then you might just want to start doing a lot of drugs
nottheonion,not_removed,when you are dead you experience nothing think about what you felt before you were born nothing there is no release when you are alive sure you experience pain suffering substance abuse mental health issues failure or whatever you want to call it but that doesnt change the simple fact that suicide is choosing to feel nothing over what you are feeling now which is something you cant even say that killing yourself brings release or relief you know when you feel releaserelief after you find out the lump on your testicles isnt cancer you dont feel the release or relief while the doctor is thumbing your testicles if you watch your girlfriend get hit by a car while crossing the street you dont experience relief while youre running over to her motionless body you experience relief after she starts to stand up and say im totally fine you also dont feel relief while you are killing yourself you pull the trigger kick the chair down the pills or whatever and then you are dead but the feeling of relief never comes there is absolutely no room for debate here i explicitly left out slitting your wrists an example above because that obviously causes a rush of endorphins but the point remains you dont feel release from your real pain ever its over you die if you just want to feel the type of release that slitting your wrists gives you then you might just want to start doing a lot of drugs
nottheonion,not_removed,and you dont know that he had been to rehab times over the course years he tried to get help and it didnt work he had gone through the process of euthanasia which isnt ticking a few boxes and getting an injection that process takes time he had made his choice and i believe he would have gone through with it youre free to think what you will but euthanasia gave him the opportunity to laugh and joke with his family in his final moments had it not been available its likely he would have died alone and his family wouldnt have had the same kind of closure
nottheonion,not_removed,the person then was suffering you cant take the rights of a current person to protect the rights of a future person who may have died for a million other reasons anyways
nottheonion,not_removed,yes you can we do that all the time thats why we dont just put down people with dislocated knees
nottheonion,not_removed,did the person with the dislocated knee want to kill them selves almost certainly not because thats something everyone knows gets better but if you wake up every morning in excruciating pain why should he be forced against his will to continue with the pain its his body to decide what to do with
nottheonion,not_removed,but an addict isnt incurable you can lock them in a room with no booze and they wont be suffering we dont do that because there are better ways but to act like an alcoholic is the same as someone with ms is ridiculous
nottheonion,not_removed,taking away someones alcohol if they have a deoendance on it will not only cause suffering it can kill them httpwwwwebmdcommentalhealthaddictionalcoholwithdrawalsymptomstreatments the point isnt if they can get better its why take away bodily autonomy you are forcing them to suffer and have no proof they will even survive to getting better let them decide for themselves
nottheonion,not_removed,because as the other guy said theyre not in a state of mind to make that decision they cant see the temporary nature of their situation
nottheonion,not_removed,theyre still a suffering human just because someone has issues doesnt mean they should be forced to suffer let them control their body
nottheonion,not_removed,for people who cant be bothered with the link dumb british blond fucks million people at once
nottheonion,not_removed,no i dont even really speak french i dont really know why i chose french but it could have been because my brother did or told me that he did

nottheonion,not_removed,it was getting upvoted pretty quickly is it not antitrump enough for this sub these days my apologies
nottheonion,not_removed,such sass
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess you could say it didnt really pay off
nottheonion,not_removed,did you watch the second video in the article it is not the first time such an incident has occurred in china — two women were attacked by siberian tigers in july when they got out of their vehicle at a beijing safari park holy cow people are dumb
nottheonion,not_removed,the tiger had heard that humans were good for impotence problems
nottheonion,not_removed,they really should have something to discourage trespassing in the animal enclosure maybe a dangerous animal would do the trick
nottheonion,not_removed,they killed the tiger come on the man committed a crime not the big cat
nottheonion,not_removed,saddest part the tigers were hungry again like a half hour later
nottheonion,not_removed,rip tiger harambe
nottheonion,not_removed,i have to go on a rant here why does every news site keep quoting peta on any matter of news involving animals why do we treat peta like its the authority on person to animal relationships hello journalists do you remember when peta was caught murdering all those adoptable puppies because they didnt want those puppies to be owned stop for fucks sake i cannot emphasize enough stop treating them like a credible input on animal welfare stop quoting them stop giving their agenda a voice
nottheonion,not_removed,how much is a zoo ticket in china
nottheonion,not_removed,natural selection at its finest these people wanted a darwin award can you blame them
nottheonion,not_removed,who wants to go to the zoo that badly
nottheonion,not_removed,what is this hero tigers name i need to take my dick out for it
nottheonion,not_removed,i am not ashamed to say that i feel way worse for the tiger that was killed than the man who jumped in there someone made a good point though this seems like it was an accident we are reading this off of nottheonion after all
nottheonion,not_removed,the incident drew criticism from people for the ethical treatment of animals peta which said it reflected the problems of keeping tigers and other large cats in captivity no it reflects what happens when stupid humans jump into tiger cages i bet it never would have happened if zhang had paid instead of fence jumping
nottheonion,not_removed,since he didnt pay tiger figured was a free meal ticket
nottheonion,not_removed,apparently a ticket to this zoo costs an arm and a leg not buying a ticket on the other hand costs two arms and legs
nottheonion,not_removed,there is a right way to do things and then there is a wong way to do things
nottheonion,not_removed,shane
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah but are the gorrilas ok
nottheonion,not_removed,his last words were pay for this stupid zoo over my dead body
nottheonion,not_removed,who do our dicks come out for now
nottheonion,not_removed,dicks out for tony
nottheonion,not_removed,this is not asian thing its always chinese
nottheonion,not_removed,pay admission climb into tiger exhibit tough choice there
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah kill the tiger for acting like a tiger definitely not the guys fault god that pisses me off
nottheonion,not_removed,so the chinese are like mcnuggets to tigers
nottheonion,not_removed,harambe
nottheonion,not_removed,i hope this happens every time someone asks for a watercup and fills it with cola
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a reminder of real life for everyone who wants to go to a zoo for the experience
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know why were wasting all this money on security guards when we have tigers
nottheonion,not_removed,he did pay for the ticket he paid with this life
nottheonion,not_removed,an experience like no other why pay general admission when you can get close and personal with your favorite carnivore sign me up
nottheonion,not_removed,the coroner was quoted as saying play stupid games win stupid prizes also kill the tiger it acted natural in front of civilians
nottheonion,not_removed,i like how peta members were complaining that this is the problem with keeping tigers in captivity no this is the problem with stupid people
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a bold move cotton lets see if it oh
nottheonion,not_removed,man zoo ticket is that expensive wtf ming lee
nottheonion,not_removed,oh fk sake here we go again just when people finally shut up about harambe
nottheonion,not_removed,zookeepers are vicious wow
nottheonion,not_removed,do they know he didnt want to pay the entrance fee he mightve had a life goal to be mauled to death by a tiger
nottheonion,not_removed,some is a fucking genius
nottheonion,not_removed,thatll teach him
nottheonion,not_removed,kind of awful how people see someone getting killed and their first instinct is to hold their phone up and record it not saying they need to jump in and save the guy but throw some shit at the tigers or something
nottheonion,not_removed,at least now he never has to pay for a zoo ticket again
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess we have a darwin awards nominee
nottheonion,not_removed,i love nature and animals and it breaks my heart to see beautiful creatures die because of humans we have billion humans i dont understand why people care about of them dying i would let an unintelligent human die before my own dog
nottheonion,not_removed,i was hopeing this was rwatchpeopledie is this a bad thing
nottheonion,not_removed,great idea now theres a tiger harambe way to go dude glad you saved that
nottheonion,not_removed,play stupid games win stupid prizes
nottheonion,not_removed,damn the guy shouldve picked the peacock enclosure to jump into instead anyways what a fucking shame that they had to kill the tiger what exactly is it supposed to do there bleh
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean they shot the bloody tiger because this arsehole was too tight to pay for a ticket so hopped the fence and got mauled this irks me to the point where i must write a slightly angry comment on the internet
nottheonion,not_removed,and they couldnt tranquilize the animal
nottheonion,not_removed,what a tragedy almost seems like this could be a simple mistake
nottheonion,not_removed,survival of the fittest at work
nottheonion,not_removed,why did they kill the tiger though
nottheonion,not_removed,why and how the hell is it in portrait and landscape and sideways at the same time
nottheonion,not_removed,you can tell they are zoo tigers because they barely know what to do
nottheonion,not_removed,what kind of monster uploads a landscapeoriented video in portrait
nottheonion,not_removed,the man is still killed
nottheonion,not_removed,couldnt tell what was going on thought his head was ripped off but apparently that didnt happen
nottheonion,not_removed,im half desensitized half terrified i cant tell if my morbid curiosity was worth it i kind of want to cry now
nottheonion,not_removed,why did i just watch that
nottheonion,not_removed,id feel bad if the video was of children or someone on safari getting mauled but this is just natural selection at work someone get me the popcorn
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont know which was worse watching that guy get chomped on or holding my head funny to watch the video
nottheonion,not_removed,of course i want to see the video
nottheonion,not_removed,intense
nottheonion,not_removed,or did it
nottheonion,not_removed,sometimes you get what you pay for
nottheonion,not_removed,it had a sequel the mans family now sue the park for negligent because the park left a way for trespass now whos to pay
nottheonion,not_removed,he didnt pay he got to see the animals success
nottheonion,not_removed,dont be catty
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought holy cow people were hindu
nottheonion,not_removed,its like the many tourists who get upclose for a and get gored we simply dont have enough wild animals in our daily lives
nottheonion,not_removed,the women got into an argument with her husband she was so angry she wasnt paying attention she lived her mother tried to save her and died husband seemed to want to save her but stood back
nottheonion,not_removed,warning death
nottheonion,not_removed,they woman who survived is also suing the zoo apparently
nottheonion,not_removed,unfortunately thats only true if theyre carriers of intelligence genes this guy clearly wasnt
nottheonion,not_removed,but zhang allegedly passed through a wire netting and eventually climbed a wall to enter the tiger enclosure while his friend stayed back well he clearly wasnt mongolian that wall did nothing to stop him
nottheonion,not_removed,its fairly controversial but as a rule maneaters are always killed the grizzly man is another fairly popular example of this the bear had to be killed because it had eaten a human its simply not safe to let it live
nottheonion,not_removed,only explanation i can find is they dont want to keep a tiger that developed a taste for human flesh
nottheonion,not_removed,and they fucking shot the tiger after the man was dead im really pissed off by this
nottheonion,not_removed,right the guy was being an idiot the tiger was just being a tiger
nottheonion,not_removed,are you stupid the guy was still alive you want them to just sit and watch when they have guns and a real chance of saving the dude
nottheonion,not_removed,jesus christ dude
nottheonion,not_removed,slow clap
nottheonion,not_removed,actually they were dead
nottheonion,not_removed,not as funny as the first time
nottheonion,not_removed,completely different case the tiger not only killed but devoured part of the man maneating animals are always killed
nottheonion,not_removed,was waiting for this as soon as the tigers name is discovered well have feline harambe the meme lives on wait
nottheonion,not_removed,plz it was just one big pussy
nottheonion,not_removed,an arm and a leg
nottheonion,not_removed,allegedly not sure got it from weibo comments
nottheonion,not_removed,around usd
nottheonion,not_removed,to be fair animals arent made for cages anymore than it would be appropriate to say you should be in a cage i know you dont feel its the same because youre a conscious human and the animal is just some thing without a conscious but in the end youre supporting locking living things up so you can amuse yourself staring at them for a small fee selfish as it is you feel this is fine so really who is without the conscious
nottheonion,not_removed,still for harambe
nottheonion,not_removed,he paid for his wife and kids first or so i heard
nottheonion,not_removed,we could have people and i would still care for the tiger that was fkin caged my love for sapiens are for the ones who actually care not the waste
nottheonion,not_removed,the holocaust was a tragedylets not throw around that word for an extremely stupid mistake
nottheonion,not_removed,he had kids already so
nottheonion,not_removed,too late though hed already had kids so the genes have been passed on
nottheonion,not_removed,complete tragedy
nottheonion,not_removed,i really didnt believe you but somehow they actually did how does that even happen
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess the same kind that video tapes someones death
nottheonion,not_removed,it happens when switch modes and hold the phone on a bad angle phone switches display mode for the viewer but not the camera dont know why they arent tied but ive done it before myself and then its hard to play back until i open it up in vlc or something and fix the orientation
nottheonion,not_removed,the same kind that doesnt even zoom in for us what a selfish punk
nottheonion,not_removed,remember that we are number one stream on facebook
nottheonion,not_removed,patiently waiting for some kind redditor to fix it and reupload
nottheonion,not_removed,oh good at least we dont have to worry about zombie outbreaks
nottheonion,not_removed,they were just breaking his neck justtigerthings
nottheonion,not_removed,so i dont have to thanks
nottheonion,not_removed,til you realize his wife and kids probably watched this whole thing go down they were there he paid for them and then tried to sneak in wonder if he was broke or just cocky either way sucks
nottheonion,not_removed,it doesnt look like the tigers got shot at least not with real bullets maybe rubber bullets maybe just warning shots to try and scare them away
nottheonion,not_removed,free close up of tigers debatably paid off
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,at least the children learnt a valuable life lesson about paying for your tickets he died dadding until the end rip
nottheonion,not_removed,thankfully that was china where maybe they dont have too many lawyers like here
nottheonion,not_removed,not knowing buffalo are dangerous is one thing i think everyone knows that a tiger can maul your face off with one swipe of its paw even a little kitty can do you some damage if it wanted to
nottheonion,not_removed,that was also a clueless asian tourist
nottheonion,not_removed,her mother tried to save her and died husband seemed to want to save her but stood back husband was obviously the only one with a brain
nottheonion,not_removed,watching him you can almost imagine the guys thought process what the hell is she doing oh shit lions ill save youoh um thats a lot of lions oh good her moms going to save heroh no her moms going to save her ill never live this down ill save you honey
nottheonion,not_removed,more recent reports said she was just carsick and wanted to change seat still tigers
nottheonion,not_removed,the poor mother
nottheonion,not_removed,thank god this shit doesnt fly in chinese courts
nottheonion,not_removed,why stop there they should also sue the car manufacturer for allowing her the leave the car also sue the husband for arguing with her seriously i hate these people who the fuck sues a zoo for their own actions
nottheonion,not_removed,ah the guy who rambled about how he was protecting the bears because he was camping the only thing he accomplished was to kill two people himself and his girlfriend and two bears the bear that killed him and another who attacked the patrol trying to recover their remains and he died with a fucking smile in his face bet his last thought was am becoming one with da bears literally
nottheonion,not_removed,once they discover how delicious humans are how succulent and well marbled the meat is the cravings the cravings cannot be stopped theres no stopping the cravings for the human meat the sweet tender human meat with the subtle smokey taste that is so common to them who could resist who could stop the human meat it just keeps calling so sweet sweet sweet human meat
nottheonion,not_removed,just take harambe as the prime example everyone knows that one
nottheonion,not_removed,but those tigars are in a zoo provided no one else climbs into the exhibit they wont have access to other humans to eat like wild tigars might
nottheonion,not_removed,no it is safe to let it live people dont need to be around the fucking bear or tigers
nottheonion,not_removed,im pretty sure this is not a thing
nottheonion,not_removed,so when else is the tiger going to get another idiot human free in his cage
nottheonion,not_removed,dicks out
nottheonion,not_removed,yes
nottheonion,not_removed,damn right theres billion of us going on probably arent tigers on the entire planet
nottheonion,not_removed,which is retarded unless it was an attack in a neighborhood or a public area as long as a person isnt a complete moron then they should never be presented with an opportunity to be eaten at a zoo
nottheonion,not_removed,honestly i think this tiger deserves to live way more than harambe a kid accidentally falling into an enclosure is one thing but being a cheap asshole and sneaking into a tiger enclosure and reaping the obvious result is another i say we let him be tiger lunch and continue with our lives
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,thats around bucks
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a lot
nottheonion,not_removed,yes he was being a idiot but come on he was just trying to avoid a fee not poach the tiger for its fur or something like that we have all been idiots at times in our life this fellas idiocy just happened to cost him is life and the poor tiger its kinda sad how many people here are more upset that the tiger is dead than the person does human life really have such little value to them
nottheonion,not_removed,but did he know he was climbing into the tiger pit
nottheonion,not_removed,yes i read the description i was just agreeing with someone else about how i understand how it could look like an accident it is just so overwhelmingly stupid that someone would actually be in that situation too bad the fireworks didnt workhe got it bad toward the end of that clip
nottheonion,not_removed,conscience those tigers were definitely conscious more than we can say for the man
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont disagree with you im saying the tigers wouldnt have killed the man had he been smart enough to not jump in a cage with tigers my views on zoos are mixed there are bad zoos there are good zoos there are also good zoos that have badly designed spaces i think the omaha zoo has amazing space for the african animals but the st louis zoo doesnt the st louis zoo however has an amazing sea lion exhibit personally id like to see st louis shut down a large portion and redesign it for other animals that dont need as much space and expand things like their reptile monkey and aquatic displays theyre poorly equipped for elephants in my armchair quarterback opinion they help educate and introduce the public to the animals and conservation programs
nottheonion,not_removed,lets not throw around the word mistake for a complete show of idiocy
nottheonion,not_removed,somebody lost their life in an extremely inhumane way this is absolutely a tragedy it doesnt matter that its their fault
nottheonion,not_removed,you set your phone on portrait to turn off the gyroscope and try to shoot the video in landscape
nottheonion,not_removed,i have to imagine such subs are moderated by teenagers who are drunk on the power they have over thousands of people its quite sad really
nottheonion,not_removed,its not gory
nottheonion,not_removed,look kids daddy is a cheap asshole and an idiot learn from your fathers mistakes
nottheonion,not_removed,reread what he said
nottheonion,not_removed,he held is head funny he did not find the video funny
nottheonion,not_removed,according to the article one of the tigers was shot
nottheonion,not_removed,it looked like the first few were flares that scared off most of them but that one that one might have been the one that was shot for real i dont know what the rest of the dozen shots were one tiger was shot dead by local police state television reported and three others nearby were dispersed using firecrackers yeah
nottheonion,not_removed,a once in a lifetime opportunity for him to feed the tigers
nottheonion,not_removed,dont get dragged by zoo animals
nottheonion,not_removed,if someone doesnt know that bison andor buffalo are dangerous i have no sympathy for them
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah but there are nicer ways of getting rid of your mother in law
nottheonion,not_removed,theres a video of that one i remember hearing about it but i dont think i saw the video
nottheonion,not_removed,fuck the upholstery in this situation im not getting out of that car
nottheonion,not_removed,does it not i always hear about all kinds of nonsense in those courts
nottheonion,not_removed,theres audio recording of his death he was not particularly ecstatic about it edit i also wouldnt say he got his girlfriend killed if i knowingly sleep in bear infested woods during their fall transition period and get eaten thats on me no matter whose idea it was im actually a big fan of timothy treadwells work sure he was crazy but he didnt want to hurt anyone and was able to research and present information about grizzlies that may never have become available otherwise
nottheonion,not_removed,it actually said he died with a grimace frozen on his face not a smile which in hindsight seems like a far more appropriate reaction to having a huge bear attempt to rip your head off your shoulders according to the article it seems like his last thoughts were something like im going to die
nottheonion,not_removed,dmt at the moment of death might account for the smiling
nottheonion,not_removed,man stop that right now before i taste myself
nottheonion,not_removed,harambe didnt eat a person very different case
nottheonion,not_removed,the tigers caretakers are absolutely at risk
nottheonion,not_removed,that tigar got a nice dinnar
nottheonion,not_removed,are the tigers caretakers not important the bear lived in an area where people are allowed to camp if it was let to live it wouldve certainly killed again
nottheonion,not_removed,i think the wording a taste for human flesh is wrong the reaction is more like so i can eat this and they will eat it it what ever they catch theyll eat it humans arent in their normal diet but if they have access and they can catch it they will want to eat it
nottheonion,not_removed,the tigers caretakers
nottheonion,not_removed,so it was the nurses poor tiger
nottheonion,not_removed,for tigerambe
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah its harsh and definitely not right but yeah
nottheonion,not_removed,which is retarded no because it wasnt known whether the man was alive
nottheonion,not_removed,yea except for you know those people who work at the zoo and have to come into contact with the tigers day in and day out seems a lot safer for them to not have any maneating tigers
nottheonion,not_removed,after this event had the tiger lived it wouldve viewed people as food if you watched he video it treated the mans body as food and shook it around like meat the issue isnt that the tiger did something wrong its that it lost its fear of humans and would have been more hostile and aggressive towards it caretakers if the man hadnt been killed and treated like food then anger about the tigers death wouldve been justifiable
nottheonion,not_removed,oooh whats that from looks like a show i could get into kind of getting a less depressing bojack vibe
nottheonion,not_removed,that is more than my zoo in phx i thought it would be like
nottheonion,not_removed,its a mentality you often see on reddit do one stupid thing you deserve everything you get up to and including death
nottheonion,not_removed,probably just this humans life he did something completely unnecessary that got himself and the tiger killed shit the article said his family paid to get in the zoo
nottheonion,not_removed,doesnt matter you shouldnt climb into any area where large and exotic animals are being kept whilst theyre not technically wild this is as close as youll get to wild
nottheonion,not_removed,good catch thanks
nottheonion,not_removed,agreed seems like he was already in the zoo and wanted to shortcut across the tiger enclosure or something as his friend avoided getting eaten
nottheonion,not_removed,meh i disagree but im kind of an asshole
nottheonion,not_removed,in other words you have to actually work to fuck up that badly
nottheonion,not_removed,my galaxy and my ipod still record in landscape
nottheonion,not_removed,its a bit gory
nottheonion,not_removed,im sure thats what your mom might have said but most people would just be sad their dad was tiger food
nottheonion,not_removed,what if he was poor and could only afford to pay for his wife and childrens tickets we dont know why he chose to scale the wall it doesnt automatically mean hes a cheap asshole
nottheonion,not_removed,theyre grrreeeeaaat
nottheonion,not_removed,buffalo look pretty mellow and slow i could see someone thinking they were like cows theyre often standing two feet from you as you drive by in the car but they smell so bad that i wouldnt get that close i have to assume that this man who snuck into the zoo didnt realize that the big open meadow was part of the tiger exhibit if he did the world is better without him but if he could get in it sounds like it wouldnt be that hard for a tiger to get out they can jump a fair distance and are strong enough to bend a loose fence out of the way
nottheonion,not_removed,any animal can be dangerous and murder you in a heartbeat but there are usually levels of perceived danger many people dont think cows are dangerous because theyre laid back and tame even though they can easily kill you i dont blame anyone for looking at a cow and not thinking theyre dangerous i also dont blame anyone for not realizing a buffalo is dangerous
nottheonion,not_removed,apparently they think that because its in a park that theyre tamed
nottheonion,not_removed,but few as satisfying
nottheonion,not_removed,against other individuals yes against a corporation heck no
nottheonion,not_removed,wasnt the audio footage locked in a safe and never listened to by the owner i thought the versions online were proven to be fake
nottheonion,not_removed,link justcurious
nottheonion,not_removed,well it proves the point that no matter what if theres even the threat of danger to the human the animal will be shot
nottheonion,not_removed,i though zoo keepers always have a fence between them and non sedated dangerous animals
nottheonion,not_removed,ah yes the maneating tiger a distinct and distant relative to the regular old ilovehumans tiger
nottheonion,not_removed,the tiger did not do anything wrong it is a predator and it ate something that encroached its space as is natural in the wild if anything is wrong here its that this tiger had to pay the price for a selfish and cheap assholes stupidity i say he got what was coming to him and the tiger should live trust me they are aware they can eat a human if given the chance were just another prey to them be it in the wild or behind glass
nottheonion,not_removed,the show is ugly americans
nottheonion,not_removed,i wonder if they would feel the same way if it was a family member or friend of theirs
nottheonion,not_removed,its just the americanslook at there prison and butt rapey stuff dont blame us all
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah he made a mistake but im still not pleased that he died even a stupid human life matters
nottheonion,not_removed,agreed what im saying is did he know it was an animal enclosure and not just a walkway or some pedestrian area of the zoo its possible he didnt realize it was an offlimits area of the zoo until he was over the top of the fence people fail to recognize really obvious things when theyre doing something against the rules like sneaking in without paying or in haste
nottheonion,not_removed,its like man mauled to death by tiger type of gory
nottheonion,not_removed,thats the fact jack
nottheonion,not_removed,you could be right a quick google search didnt turn up any official sources either way but more research could lead to a definitive answer when ive got the time i never had any desire to listen to it so this is the first time ive actually looked into it
nottheonion,not_removed,the tape was destroyed i think so anyway she was advised to destroy it the tape was never released and very few have heard it few as in or
nottheonion,not_removed,i saw someone beat me to the link but i found a site that includes written details of the audio for the faint of heart like myself who would rather read than listen anyway httpwwwyellowstonebearmancomtimtreadwellhtml
nottheonion,not_removed,ok
nottheonion,not_removed,nope
nottheonion,not_removed,i cannot think of much better nomenclature for a tiger that has eaten a man than a maneating tiger the ilovehumans tigers however may be more aptly called manfearing tigers for the sake of simplicity and rolling off the tongue more than anything else
nottheonion,not_removed,trust me they are aware they can eat a human if given the chance spoken like someone who has never studied animals
nottheonion,not_removed,cheers dude rock on
nottheonion,not_removed,sorry not sorry my boyfriend or family jumps into a tiger enclosure im just going to scream i know you watched the jungle book what the fuck did you think would happen
nottheonion,not_removed,ah sorry from your reply i thought you mean youd heard the recordings never mind me
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks i was looking for something like that link you provided as well so that works out
nottheonion,not_removed,fake as hell really dude this is laughable
nottheonion,not_removed,ok dr dewlittle please enlighten me on how peaceful tigers are typically they are not sharks
nottheonion,not_removed,its not that tigers are peaceful its that they dont go out of their way to attack or hunt humans because they see us as a threat the reason the tiger attacked this man is because the tiger was not familiar with him and he entered its territory predators dont hunt each other for the fear of being injured during the fight the tiger learned from this event that it is able to overpower a human and kill it this man was attacked because he provoked the tiger by entering its space but if it had lived its fear of humans would be gone and it would be much more likely for it to attack unprovoked because it knows that it will win
nottheonion,not_removed,its true that predators dont hunt each other but it is untrue that the tiger sees humans as an equal or a particular threat the only peace they likely have is more similar to he feeds me so he can stay and having a cattleprod to punish them when they act up its not like this tiger tasted human blood and this experience enlightened it on its capability tigers dont eat humans often only because they are not a good source of food and not typical prey and even then they kill more humans than any other big cat i can see your whole point is stemming down to human lives animal lives which i agree with but only to a certain extent in this instance i say that the tiger should live do you believe the orca tillikum killed multiple times because it realized it could edit what im trying to say here is was common knowledge or so i thought before this exchange of ours regardless of their captivity these animals are dangerous and need to be respected anyone who is surprised when a powerful animal lashes out in captivity is a moron and if it costs that animal its life it is tragic

nottheonion,not_removed,ianal but it looks like this one made sense the conviction was thrown out because the jury was given too broad of a definition for corruption the problem was not what he did or not if the instructions to the jury were incorrect they need to vacate the judgment makes sense to me

nottheonion,not_removed,someone had stolen two of the barns walls and at least they left me one wall he said laughing i am very intrigued by this mans triangular barn
nottheonion,not_removed,my sister was just convinced not to by a table made of worn wood for a table that looks like its been out in the yard since the thats dollars with added to the end thats the cost of dirtcondition cars for you to play with thats the cost of months rent in my area for a table
nottheonion,not_removed,meh not having a front wall is common lol
nottheonion,not_removed,you used to be able to harvest worn wood from snow drift fences all across wyoming as long as you replaced the old wood with state provided wood you got to keep what you replaced as i recall if you could find a good buyer in la or new york you could make a hundred or so per plank if the weathering was good then sometime in the late a private company got an exclusive deal with the state so only they could harvest the worn wood
nottheonion,not_removed,thats as many as tens and thats terrible
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean its a barn not a shed
nottheonion,not_removed,good thing people break our their oxford dictionary for everyday speech then again if you want to be pedantic the ones i see wouldnt really be a shed either out here a shed is usually a small building you would typically see in the suburbs you might fit a push mower and some other lawn care tools in it but not much else the barns are huge have heavy farm equipment hay and whatever else whether or not they have a front wall is typically decided based on whether horses or other animals are kept in them but all of them are called barns

nottheonion,not_removed,how is this not florida
nottheonion,not_removed,guess she wanted the blood back
nottheonion,not_removed,well at least we arent talking about ferguson anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,seems like a fair exchange
nottheonion,not_removed,vanetter warned an investigator that she has the potential to become a serial killer thats adorable i wonder if shes frequently referenced in riamverybadass
nottheonion,not_removed,some people are just freaky as fuck
nottheonion,not_removed,rmetal
nottheonion,not_removed,she looks just awful
nottheonion,not_removed,which one wrote sorry
nottheonion,not_removed,missouri is the new florida
nottheonion,not_removed,absolutely
nottheonion,not_removed,i she does though thats like making fun of a murderer saying he could kill a bunch of people
nottheonion,not_removed,nearly everyone has the potential to become a serial killer it takes a special combination of crazy and stupid to say that to a person investigating a stabbing youre responsible for plus theres a difference between the violent outburst of a mentally ill person and the prolonged actions of a serial killer sometimes i guess in some cases its really just a matter of frequency
nottheonion,not_removed,hopefully its a cry for help i imagine some people walking that path wish that they werent

nottheonion,not_removed,gotta keep those stereotypes alive here

nottheonion,not_removed,ah the ol reddit catholicaroo not gonna link it sorry
nottheonion,not_removed,this is why its important not to teach kids to believe in the supernatural
nottheonion,not_removed,like many cool jokes it wasnt really a joke it appeared nonsequitur because of catholic pr but given that the catholic church is identified in the bible as apostate note comments in this thread it should hardly be surprising that people who have been raised in that institution can end up as the most savage lunatics the catholic churchs bloody horrible history is why people dont equate christianity with love even though scripturally thats what christianity is supposed to be john
nottheonion,not_removed,we teach all kids to believe in santa claus doesnt seem to do much harm
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,the catholic church is no more apostate than any other church
nottheonion,not_removed,all religious sects and flavours are equal in their nonsense
nottheonion,not_removed,well but of course since all protestant churches are derived from the catholic church they share the same history and problems see for example that new york church whose pastor beat his son to death for wanting to get out httpwwwcbsnewscomnewsfatherofnewyorkteenkilledinchurchbeatingpleadsguilty
nottheonion,not_removed,the crazy started real quick
nottheonion,not_removed,we tell our kids to put away those childish things before adulthood an adult that believes in santa is not going to fair well in society
nottheonion,not_removed,yep theres very little doctrinal difference between catholic orthodox and protestant churches the major difference is who the checks get written to
nottheonion,not_removed,if i had been tased i would love a sorry i tased you cake its oddly charming enough that i really wouldnt be bothered be having been tased after receiving it then again i am ridiculously easy to bribe with pastries and coffee so i probably just have a really low bar with baked goods
nottheonion,not_removed,i feel better about an officer who tases someone unnecessarily recognizes it was overkill learns and apologizes than i do about one who tases someone unnecessarily and stands by the decision forever
nottheonion,not_removed,this is a hoax that cake picture has been around for two years well before the incident took place
nottheonion,not_removed,in other news sex offender sends sorry i tasted you cake receives years
nottheonion,not_removed,what is the traditional flavor for sorry i tased you cake chocolate vanilla maybe lemon
nottheonion,not_removed,i told them this would happen if they started hiring year old girls
nottheonion,not_removed,woah woah woah what happened to the cake though i want to know what happened to it the true crime here is letting good cake go to waste
nottheonion,not_removed,now i know what not to do if i taise someone
nottheonion,not_removed,sorry i tased you s
nottheonion,not_removed,cops should be forced to bake a cake for all their fuck ups sorry i shot your dog sorry i flash banged your baby sorry i took you into custody and you mysteriously died in the holding cell
nottheonion,not_removed,the cake didnt cut it for stephanie byron
nottheonion,not_removed,this is hilarious shes becoming an example of trying to have her cake and eating it too
nottheonion,not_removed,giving a cake is now considered worse than potentially giving them a heart seizure
nottheonion,not_removed,the lawsuit also says wohlers told his employer that he accidentally discharged his device into a pillow at his house i wonder if he made himself a cake for that one
nottheonion,not_removed,i came here to post this article so classic
nottheonion,not_removed,i feel like nobody here actually read the article the officer was visiting for personal reasons and used his taser on stephanie its not as if he used it while upholding the law and apologized later he attacked her and then tried to make up by giving her a cake to me thats extremely messed up he then lied to his employer and said he accidentally discharged it into a pillow not stephanie
nottheonion,not_removed,the response also said wohlers is protected by qualified immunity – rights that can shield government officials from civil liability lawsuits if the official did not knowingly violate a citizens rights while performing their duties but
nottheonion,not_removed,i read the comments on the globalnewsca and someone stated that the cake has two cops on it they also stated that this cake could be an old cake where a cop tasered another cop on accident so could this be a set up the cake does has two poorly drawn cops on it one is even a female while the story says the officer is male and the kid was a male
nottheonion,not_removed,soon as he gave her the cake she said are you calling me fat
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a bit of a shocker
nottheonion,not_removed,at least he tried honestly it seems pretty sweet and i imagine they must be pretty sorry to go to the effort
nottheonion,not_removed,he should have just shot her
nottheonion,not_removed,probation they should be given a promotion
nottheonion,not_removed,in the face
nottheonion,not_removed,i think its a really sweet gesture id totally forgive any police brutality that didnt lead to a lifelong handicap or worse if i got a homemade cake
nottheonion,not_removed,not if youre that kid that got tased for seconds straight i dont think a cake will bring back regular brain function and cognition
nottheonion,not_removed,because he knows that if he admits mistake he will be placed on probation and probably lose his job oh wait glad they caught those and let it be a lesson to the rest of the force s edit that said the version reported does make the cop seem like a crazy guy
nottheonion,not_removed,i think the cake could be seen as rubbing it in inappropriate or just a straight up bribe to keep the person quiet while i do think the officer didnt have bad intentions from a professional level it makes sense
nottheonion,not_removed,or shoots them instead
nottheonion,not_removed,thats what i read at first and i said ummm
nottheonion,not_removed,you mean months with good behavior if you have the tongue of a champion
nottheonion,not_removed,i added some peanuts i heard you were allergic
nottheonion,not_removed,pop rocks with electric pink frosting
nottheonion,not_removed,write a confession to wrongdoing on a cake pretty sure any attorney would advise against that
nottheonion,not_removed,sorry the swat team had the wrong address sorry i confiscated all of your cash sorry you committed suicide while handcuffed in the back of my car
nottheonion,not_removed,i discharge my device into a pillow all the time ever since my box got too full
nottheonion,not_removed,the cake is a lie it is a picture from a full year before the shooting
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe he didnt want to go on vacation
nottheonion,not_removed,the cake is a lie
nottheonion,not_removed,dont tease me
nottheonion,not_removed,why didnt he nuke it from orbit
nottheonion,not_removed,youre only allowed to burn down your house in australia our huntsman spiders are scary
nottheonion,not_removed,this news report looks like it was written by a tenyearold in the fourth grade why do people with no interest or talent for writing get jobs in the news industry
nottheonion,not_removed,what a pathetic lie lol
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a normal response yes

nottheonion,not_removed,what a ride of a title no previous word betrayed the next simply magnificent
nottheonion,not_removed,you could waste your time in worse ways within a penitentiary
nottheonion,not_removed,i bet the groupies suck
nottheonion,not_removed,fun fact that same prison holds subway pitchman jared fogle
nottheonion,not_removed,he does parody songs under the name weird rod blagojevich
nottheonion,not_removed,i want to know more about this ernie b fellow sounds like hes the real mastermind behind this outfit
nottheonion,not_removed,corruption and roses
nottheonion,not_removed,reminds me of arrested development george sr goes to prison for tax fraud and money laundering and ends up being the captain of a prison basketball team
nottheonion,not_removed,back when it was illegal to sell appointments
nottheonion,not_removed,if anything the fact that hes making such a positive impact in the lives of the other inmates seems like a good argument against early release more privileges perhaps this feels like the ideal penance for his crime instead of selling power to those who already have some hes giving power and ability to those who need it most i mean suppose he keeps this going on imagine all the inmates hes helped going out into the world and making a difference in their own lives in their communities spreading that vibe to others how long would it take before the difference they make outweighs the difference the people in those senate seats might have made
nottheonion,not_removed,i wonder if he likes the groupies in prison
nottheonion,not_removed,fuck if you can make music in jail then that shit wouldnt be too bad
nottheonion,not_removed,im embarrassed to be from illinois of the time
nottheonion,not_removed,he is interested in helping people weve been aware of this for years now
nottheonion,not_removed,does hillary play an instrument maybe she can join the band

nottheonion,not_removed,cant wait to hear their judas priest cover
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe hed get out sooner if he went with organizing a broadway musical in there
nottheonion,not_removed,blaggys a special case though he got busted doing the same damn shit other politicians get away with all the time only difference is hes dumb enough to make those dealings on the phone of a public office that happened to be monitored anybody else pulling that shit does it during fundraiser dinners golf outings hunting or fishing trips and stuff like that where its inperson and not so easily subject to monitoring however id bet his prison life is pretty cushy the ones he took the fall for that didnt get busted or named are making sure that its not much more than a prolonged vacation in accomodations similar to a college dorm the political workings of chicago and the current presidential office probably saluted him as he headed to colorado
nottheonion,not_removed,narcissists are good at manipulating the people around them especially in a place like prison where being unfriendly with certain people can cost you your life
nottheonion,not_removed,just like all these broke ass politicians do seeking power in order to gain wealth life isnt a popularity contest and our elections shouldnt be decided like it is
nottheonion,not_removed,omg i live in colorado
nottheonion,not_removed,in case youre wondering its pronounced bluhgoyovitch
nottheonion,not_removed,fuck the cubs
nottheonion,not_removed,he is going to need some band members guilty of the same crimesand barack hussein leaving the white house soon i know hes got mad drum skills
nottheonion,not_removed,hopefully their album goes fucking golden
nottheonion,not_removed,he should cover this song httpsyoutubeuiiuucfqtaq
nottheonion,not_removed,felt like subreddit simulator
nottheonion,not_removed,i loved your comment then i saw your name and knew what love really is two zeds
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt that kind of the point of prison though to not be able to participate freely with the rest of the world
nottheonion,not_removed,obviously they suck what else are they gonna do
nottheonion,not_removed,i smell a sitcom
nottheonion,not_removed,i smell a sitcom
nottheonion,not_removed,how about just the state or the administration
nottheonion,not_removed,its not illegal to sell its illegal to get caught
nottheonion,not_removed,political corruption is absolute poison for democracies the man has to pay
nottheonion,not_removed,im guessing hes in one of those federal prisons that rich people get sent
nottheonion,not_removed,and you guys say race plays no part in why you dont like him i can clearly see that in your comment
nottheonion,not_removed,delusional
nottheonion,not_removed,double platinum with no features
nottheonion,not_removed,no prison is theoretically for rehabilitation public safety deterrence and punishment although this case in particular is mostly about deterrence and punishment
nottheonion,not_removed,in jail i guess buttfucking comes to mind and not the kind im into ie doing the buttfucking not having it done to me
nottheonion,not_removed,its not illegal you just pay with your life when prosecutors get bored and ambitious
nottheonion,not_removed,if he can do some good for others while serving his time then i can live with that
nottheonion,not_removed,except the whole case was total bullshit and just a ploy by greedy prosecutors to make a name for themselves but yeah he like has to pay torture him
nottheonion,not_removed,the whole article is about all the stunning praise other inmates have to give him and all the good hes doing and depressingly not about his elvis cover band am i the only one a bit depressed to not be informed as to whether or not he was growing out a pompadour honestly it all feels manufactured like a pitch to get his sentence lowered because it probably is now the big question is if the inmates are actually benefitting from it and arent just promised with future bribes for saying nice things about the gov well then even as a sociopath maybe some good can come of it anyhow it feels like propagandabut i want to hope i still think hes a pos but i hope hes not
nottheonion,not_removed,could she stand in the middle of avenue and shoot somebody
nottheonion,not_removed,you still think shell get arrested no i dont think she will i was just making a dumb joke
nottheonion,not_removed,tips tinfoil hat
nottheonion,not_removed,theres no reason to insist on calling him hussein besides the connotations it holds for saddam terrorism and vague middleeasternness
nottheonion,not_removed,right because heaven forbid we intone that barack hussein was anything but an angel sent from heaven while he governed illinois
nottheonion,not_removed,if you can form a band you arent really being punished
nottheonion,not_removed,i never said we should torture him
nottheonion,not_removed,youre fucking kidding right hes a lying deceitful thieving sack of shit who disgraced the democratic party and the people of illinois let him sit in jail
nottheonion,not_removed,you are completely within your rights to state that you think obama is a criminal never said you couldnt likewise im allowed to say that youre delusional for thinking so
nottheonion,not_removed,its to punish the other inmates
nottheonion,not_removed,so what the fuck do you want prisoners should not socialize with one another lets just lock everyone up in in the isolation tubes huh
nottheonion,not_removed,imprisonment is a form of torture especially in the us jail system it just happens to be culturally accepted because our society hasnt yet reached the level of sophistication to properly address and fix the issue
nottheonion,not_removed,i never said he should get less time im just saying it feels like propaganda in order to get less time and even if its all propaganda hes still doing good allegedly once again no one is asking for his sentence to be shortened why you think im advocating his release is just absolutely baffeling the only one who wants a shorter sentence is blagoiavitch and his fucking lawyer if anything the rat snake is doing more work in prison then he ever did outside of it so if anything im advocating a longer sentence so get out of here with that
nottheonion,not_removed,she didnt pull the trigger so your post is irrelevant
nottheonion,not_removed,very well i am delusional for stating the obvious hussein had used the same exact people that were suddenly convicted under blago and yet he odumbo was able to magically go scott free ever wonder how he did it
nottheonion,not_removed,ok that makes sense
nottheonion,not_removed,ok but thats a separate issue not everything has to turn into your own little diatribe about the sorry state of the doc
nottheonion,not_removed,no
nottheonion,not_removed,you missed by main point which is that he is wrongfully convicted
nottheonion,not_removed,your point is wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,to someone who doesnt see beneath the surface yeah
nottheonion,not_removed,a man who president donald trump has promoted as an authority on voter fraud was registered to vote in multiple states during the presidential election the associated press has learned gregg phillips whose unsubstantiated claim that the election was marred by million illegal votes was tweeted by the president was listed on the rolls in alabama texas and mississippi according to voting records and election officials in those states he voted only in alabama in november records show

nottheonion,not_removed,to put it in perspective jean marie river currently pays per kilowatt hour for power in those bigger buildings compared to fort providence — another diesel community — which pays thats the most expensive rate i have heard of

nottheonion,not_removed,its an isolated area diesel generation is the best option problem is fuel isnt cheap and they skew the cost to give residential users a lower rate
nottheonion,not_removed,as in sodapop you smug inefficient sodasaying chud
nottheonion,not_removed,in canada soda is soda water ie no taste and pop is every other sweet carbonated beverage
nottheonion,not_removed,no pop like read the damn article

nottheonion,not_removed,we say soft drinks round here
nottheonion,not_removed,thank you
nottheonion,not_removed,what article
nottheonion,not_removed,it might be cheaper to leave it outside and heat it to keep it above freezing
nottheonion,not_removed,hey if i lived in a town of id want to contract diabetes and die too
nottheonion,not_removed,well to be fair it is rtodayilearned not rtomorrowilearned
nottheonion,not_removed,wingardium gaseosa
nottheonion,not_removed,the article
nottheonion,not_removed,if only they made soda that didnt have sugar in it
nottheonion,not_removed,how many soda machines do you see that carry even one sugarfree soda let alone an entire inventory of them pretty rare dude
nottheonion,not_removed,the hospital i work in is only allowed sugar free drinks in its vending machines can be a pain when you want that fullfat sugary midnight fix
nottheonion,not_removed,even one sugarfree soda just shy of although i wish there was more variety but i usually have a couple of options at least
nottheonion,not_removed,but it also recommended the force should introduce new procedures for dealing with similar incidents in future deputy chief constable gareth pritchard said it is regrettable that the dog died in this way and i fully understand the level of public concern you cant very well say something is regrettable and something else should have been done while being justified

nottheonion,not_removed,given they plan to live together as a married couple but divorce on paper they wouldnt even be granted one in australia you need to satisfy the court that you and your spouse have lived separately and apart for at least months and there is no reasonable likelihood of resuming married life
nottheonion,not_removed,thatll show them
nottheonion,not_removed,theyll be unhappy to know that i just did a quick count and it appears absolutely nobody will give a single shit
nottheonion,not_removed,til same sex marriage isnt already legal in australia
nottheonion,not_removed,if youre against gay marriage dont marry a gay person your involvement should end there
nottheonion,not_removed,lets see which is the bigger threat to marriage allowing samesex couples to marry the actual dissolution of marriage hmm tough choice
nottheonion,not_removed,it has always been understood to be an exclusive relationship where one man and one woman become one flesh always dont let this guy read a bible it might traumatize him
nottheonion,not_removed,im ganna prove the sanctity of a christian marriage by breaking the sanctity of a christian marriage ya
nottheonion,not_removed,the christian couple nick and sarah jensen have been married for over years and told journalists they have a happy and healthy marriage and no plans to separate happy and healthy and chock full of hate
nottheonion,not_removed,it is a sacred instituion ordained by god he says complaning not about his own pending divorce devaluing his marriage but the government giving value official creedence to other peoples marriages my grandfather said it all the time lord save me from your followers
nottheonion,not_removed,til death do us part unless you know dudes are fuckin
nottheonion,not_removed,my first thought christian couple seeks excuse to disolve failing marriage literally any reason that absolves them from personal responsibility no matter how bullshit
nottheonion,not_removed,idiots this is the very definition of cutting off your nose to spite your face whats next christian family aborts planned pregnancy as a sign of protest against some prochoice law passing
nottheonion,not_removed,everyones missing the real reason they are getting divorced they now realize they can marry someone of the same sex like theyve always secretly wanted to
nottheonion,not_removed,so get divorced like anyone gives a shit they say they have a happy healthy marriage well everyone deserves that regardless everyone deserves to be loved everyone deserves to be happy everyone deserves to live their life the way they see fit as long as you arent hurting others
nottheonion,not_removed,how funny that they fail to see the irony of doing something that effects absolutely no one else but them in any way as a way of protesting something that effects them in absolutely no way at all
nottheonion,not_removed,funnily enough the bible is also heavily against divorce because from a christian viewpoint christian marriage is a direct representation of christ and the church its a serious promise to love no matter what and from a christian viewpoint it shouldnt be broken except for very special circumstances being pissed off at a man made law that doesnt effect the church or other christians is not something god expects you to divorce over
nottheonion,not_removed,their hatred of homosexual is more powerful than their love for eachother what a message
nottheonion,not_removed,lets show them how theyre destroying the sanctity of marriage by destroying the sanctity of marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,oh the irony of their being legally allowed to divorce please for the love of god someone point this out to them
nottheonion,not_removed,itll be a slow motion protest the only grounds for divorce in australia is irreconcilable differences and the only standard of proof is months separation they cant just walk into a court room and get it done
nottheonion,not_removed,im more concerned about all the natural disasters homosexuals cause how can we as a nation harness their mystical power as a weapon think of the possibilities
nottheonion,not_removed,as an aussie i dont give two fucks what the gays do they want to get married thats cool whats it got to do with me aint no hair off my ass might even be good for the economy everyone knows they have disposable income and a flair for splashy events and the polies know australians dont give a rats ass either thats why they wont open it to a vote they know theyd lose and then their religious voters would get upset
nottheonion,not_removed,dear australia let me clarify our roles in this world your job is talking about how dangerous wildlife can be in australia leave being assholes to us sincerely usa
nottheonion,not_removed,they wont tho just like every american that swore to move to canadamexico every election
nottheonion,not_removed,so what do it
nottheonion,not_removed,if gay marriage gets legalized im going to eat a cheeseburger nobody gives a shit about that either
nottheonion,not_removed,every time i hear about something like this it never seems like they follow through
nottheonion,not_removed,then youre breaking your vow to god so youre saying the state has sanctioned sin so im going to sin as protest fucking idiots no wonder they believe in a magical person with all seeingknowing powers who isnt santa clause
nottheonion,not_removed,how do christians still not realize that marriage in one form or another has existed way longer than christianity it has nothing to do with their religion
nottheonion,not_removed,divorce is a sin and violates the sanctity of marriage jesus spoke of this in the bible in marriage the two become one flesh in a union joined by god therefore what god has joined together no human being must separatemark
nottheonion,not_removed,i wonder how devout christians protested the diminished sanctity of marriage when divorce became legal
nottheonion,not_removed,had an old guy in my gym say that same sex marriage devalues his marriage i said devalue what are you planning on selling it
nottheonion,not_removed,good for themim always happy when i see this kind of storiessomeone thatafter years of a forced marriage by their parents can finally break and find a same sex partner like that always wantedthis kind of stories really warms your heart
nottheonion,not_removed,what a perfect excuse to undo a marriage that you regret getting at the age of
nottheonion,not_removed,just getting a motive to divorce
nottheonion,not_removed,hypocritical losers peter above all love each other deeply because love covers over a multitude of sins luke do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned forgive and you will be forgiven
nottheonion,not_removed,but how will i explain to my kids that a couple is getting divorced
nottheonion,not_removed,wow thats the most worthless and asinine form of protest ive ever heard of however we should wholeheartedly support their efforts to fuck up their own lives
nottheonion,not_removed,this is the definition of selfvictimizing
nottheonion,not_removed,this from the same country that has a tv show about marrying at first sight you can get married on a game show but not to the person you truly love if they are of the same sex
nottheonion,not_removed,so they arent christian clearly
nottheonion,not_removed,well fine good for them they should just go do whatever floats their narrow little boat i just do not get it i have tried and tried to get my head around why anyone would give a damn whether or not gays can get married dont we want people to have stable relationships and these numbskulls are threatening to split up if other human beings finally have their private lives given a token of credence how pathetic is that what my husband and i have together is not influenced at all by anything any couple or single person or polyamorous grouping has or does with each other if i knew about certain aspects of various peoples sex lives it might put me off my lunch but it is not going to take away anything from my private relationship for example the thought of anyone crawling into bed with donaldtrump makes me gag i find that far more offensive than what happens in the bedrooms of the gay folks that i know but it does not make my sex life worse or make the promises my husband and i share any less meaningful or true
nottheonion,not_removed,i grew up in a time of extreme homophobia and was raised by a christian parent who brainwashed me to think her way if i can after i left home come to my senses and change my beliefs to acceptance then so can the rest of the fucking world people have a right to be happy people have a right to not be alone let them if these christian twats want to get a divorce good some time on their own might do them some good
nottheonion,not_removed,oh no the poor little intolerant christians ill be sure to cry into my pillow for them tonight before bed
nottheonion,not_removed,i am so sick of people using religion as a means for their hate
nottheonion,not_removed,what is the deal with christians and state marriage licenses if marriage is some scared union between man woman and gd why is the state issuing these licenses can we have religious marriage and state marriage separated what if we change the name of marriage to civil union and let religions deal with sacred unions
nottheonion,not_removed,cutting off your nose to spite your face
nottheonion,not_removed,so which one of them wanted a divorce anyway and saw opportunity
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont care if the christian couple is married i just dont want them raising bigoted children
nottheonion,not_removed,this doesnt have anything to do with one of them wanting to fuck someone else
nottheonion,not_removed,oh no
nottheonion,not_removed,religious people are the dumbest people in society
nottheonion,not_removed,bye felicia
nottheonion,not_removed,i fully support their right to divorce same as i support others right to marry
nottheonion,not_removed,lets be honest they are both going to be openly gay and enter into same sex partnerships
nottheonion,not_removed,i think one of them is just gay and wants to marry someone of the same gender
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont understand gay couples getting married doesnt effect them in any way why do they care ive never understood busybodies like this couple
nottheonion,not_removed,did people forgot that divorce was once a sin and very frowned upon
nottheonion,not_removed,so they can marry their secret gay lovers
nottheonion,not_removed,could not care less
nottheonion,not_removed,probably so they can ditch their fake marriage for taxes and the rents and then get married to their same sex loverstwist
nottheonion,not_removed,lol ok enjoy your divorce
nottheonion,not_removed,ive said it before but i think it bears repeating here if i find myself spending more time worrying what god thinks about other peoples behaviour than what he thinks about my own behaviour i am almost certainly not acting how he wants me to anyway if i wanted to take a very hardline fundamentalist attitude to marriage and its sanctity i reckon that that battle was lost once nonreligious weddings registry office ones in the uk were allowed such marriages can themselves hardly claim to be a holy institution ordained by god so i would have to ask mr and mrs ms jensen why they have not already got divorced in protest against how such marriages ruin the sanctity of theirs the reason at least in part is that we all like to have our own hierarchy of sins or whatever our personal belief system calls them and we tend to grade those that we are not ourselves tempted by as higher up the naughtiness scale in doing so the religious amongst us want to pretend to god that we are more holy and therefore more deserving which of course in fact flies in the face of the concept of sole fide justification purely by faith not by our own actions
nottheonion,not_removed,i hope they divorce people should stop being so angry at other peoples relationships theyre not yours so why do you care live your life not someone elses
nottheonion,not_removed,never understand why people are so concerned about what people of the same sex are doing together we are all bought upon this earth in the same way and go out the same so fuck it
nottheonion,not_removed,let us uphold the church canon by violating it becauseprinciples
nottheonion,not_removed,i fail to see how two people getting married affects someone elses marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,some people are just stupid worry about your own lives quit trying to force your opinion on others christianity is a farce just like all other religions you dont need a religion to believe in a higher power if god is the ipitomy of unconditional love then why do religions preach that god will judge you unconditional means no judgment just love everyone
nottheonion,not_removed,and the rest of the australian population will give zero fucks source am australian
nottheonion,not_removed,i would like to attend their divorce ceremony
nottheonion,not_removed,annnnd the jensen divorce countdown starts now
nottheonion,not_removed,so much for till death do us part
nottheonion,not_removed,its like how milo said that whole thing about not accepting the idea of same sex marriage because its something that shouldnt even be an issue i think thats what he said im not sure idk something along those lines
nottheonion,not_removed,honestly someone getting married is none of my business not one iota not one bit who am i to tell someone they can or cannot love someone the impact of someone getting married is nothing on my life so why make such a stink they want to get a divorce yeah so what
nottheonion,not_removed,i like the brothers response respectful exchange of ideas and opinions is how the world should progress not through hatred malice intolerance and ignorance that goes for both sides personally i think its kind of ridiculous that people protest gay marriage so forcefully but are fine with eating shellfish and wearing a variety of clothing materials but if others disagree with me thats their right and i wont just dismiss their views as stupid or invalid
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought god wasnt a big fan of divorce
nottheonion,not_removed,how about the part of the bible that states that the only grounds for divorce is adultery are they forgetting something
nottheonion,not_removed,christian sinner here i would like to insert my ¢ folks although i pretty much follow the bibles policy when it comes to homosexuality aside from some of the old testament stuff i also follow the teachings of christ when he said to love my fellow man i may not agree with the idea of homosexuality but i respect the people who do i have a gay family member and he also happens to be my favorite uncle what i have no respect for is the intolerance other people have towards those whos lives and beliefs differ from their own in the bible it says that all sins are equally bad in gods eyes so to become divorced is no worse than marrying a member of your own genders i really wish people would stop judging each other so much its not our place to do so and it damn sure isnt our place to crucify our fellow man for not being the same as we are thats my rant happy new year love you reddit
nottheonion,not_removed,if they legalize same sex marriage i will order an xl specialty pizza from papa johns using a off coupon and when it gets here i will throw it in the garbage
nottheonion,not_removed,divorce is condemned by jesus
nottheonion,not_removed,i know the bible never even once mentions samesex marriage but doesnt it have some rather harsh words about divorce
nottheonion,not_removed,its only for us were special youre not waaaaaaaaaah
nottheonion,not_removed,and all the world stands in unison and shouts ok
nottheonion,not_removed,andwho is supposed to give a fuck
nottheonion,not_removed,they were just looking for an excuse to get divorced
nottheonion,not_removed,didnt this happen a while ago also if you believe that marriage is just between a man and a woman and that god made it so then great but doesnt believing that the human law is stronger and more important than the law of god which god is very anti divorce mean that you have more faith in the government than god
nottheonion,not_removed,like the old saying holding a grudge is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die in this case though it is resentment
nottheonion,not_removed,dont worry theyre just lying to force their agenda on others they wont divorce that would be a personal sacrifice
nottheonion,not_removed,and the stupidest people in australia award goes to
nottheonion,not_removed,so fucking what pass the law
nottheonion,not_removed,oh nowe cant now
nottheonion,not_removed,i just love people protesting that their intolerance wont be backed by law anymore as a matter of conscience uh huh
nottheonion,not_removed,i find this humorous because within christianity the bible lays out pretty specific guidelines for acceptable divorce and rebellion against the state is not one of those conditions
nottheonion,not_removed,oh good fewer shitty christians then this makes me want to try to be gay just to piss them off
nottheonion,not_removed,congratulations you played yourself
nottheonion,not_removed,who cares
nottheonion,not_removed,watch me move onto my life without a single fuck given
nottheonion,not_removed,does anybody care what they do
nottheonion,not_removed,oh boy if people are allowed to do what we can were gonna not do it anymore were gonna have others decisions dictate our lives morons
nottheonion,not_removed,let em lol if theyre that dumb to think that an entire countrys decision is going to depend on one couples marriage theyre dumb af should split before they breed pass on their conceded homophobic way of living
nottheonion,not_removed,good
nottheonion,not_removed,k
nottheonion,not_removed,imagine how funny it will be if these two will blame gays for their divorce
nottheonion,not_removed,if someone else wanting the same rights as you causes you to abandon your rights they arent the problem here also isnt divorce a sin in your book
nottheonion,not_removed,good
nottheonion,not_removed,if they are christians they cant get divorced without sinning except for marital unfaithfulness
nottheonion,not_removed,boo fucken hoo
nottheonion,not_removed,religious folk and their sound minds
nottheonion,not_removed,oh well in that case lets ignore the rights of thousands of couples
nottheonion,not_removed,why not take it one further murdersuicide go on do the right thing for the planet
nottheonion,not_removed,if anything ever deserved a k its this k
nottheonion,not_removed,wheres the logic
nottheonion,not_removed,after seeing a picture of the two of them i think hes just looking for any excuse to get away she looks like joe torre
nottheonion,not_removed,clearly so they can have the opportunity to marry people theyre actually attracted to instead of each other
nottheonion,not_removed,who gives a fuck if they do theyd just being paying more taxes showed the government so hard
nottheonion,not_removed,they should get gay married and have lots of gay sex as a protest
nottheonion,not_removed,they should really step up their protest by killing themselves instead they shouldnt want to live in a world with gay marriage get to the lord people hell welcome you with open arms for your bravery
nottheonion,not_removed,let them do whatever they want just dont give them any attention
nottheonion,not_removed,dibs on the tv
nottheonion,not_removed,a public ruse to end their marriage and pretend it was political instead of personal
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt divorce frowned upon in christianity seems kinda i dont know fucking stupid
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe theyre both gay and married to each other for benefits
nottheonion,not_removed,they plan to divorce so they can finally legally marry their true partners
nottheonion,not_removed,so get divorced then youre the ones who seem to be placing a ridiculous amount of importance in what marriage is it will negatively affect your lives and the rest of us still wont give a shit about it makes perfect sense if you ask me let the gay haters bring unhappiness on themselves at no expense of others
nottheonion,not_removed,religious fanatics making the world better since bc
nottheonion,not_removed,and by them getting divorced makes a difference how whos going to care is anyone going to see them get divorced and say oh wow theyve just made a really good point whoops we made a mistake reverse the law pronto
nottheonion,not_removed,hypocritical much i thought divorce was looked down upon in christianity this is just weak get over yourselves gay marriage doesnt even effect you
nottheonion,not_removed,crazy that no one seems to have mentioned the border herald is clearly a fake news site
nottheonion,not_removed,this is a couple of years old not sure why its news again now literally no one cares about them
nottheonion,not_removed,i never liked you anyways dick
nottheonion,not_removed,as a christian good if thats what they want to make a marriage about they shouldnt be married in the first place so many idiots
nottheonion,not_removed,every single time this issue comes up theres always someone who acts like gay marriage is replacing straight marriage the level of opposition would be totally reasonable if that was the case but fighting to block something that is totally inconsequential to you but will make other people happy seems so insane to me
nottheonion,not_removed,who cares
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah why not protest against the sanctity of marriage by abusing the notion of sanctity of marriage jesus christ why cant people just keep themselves to themselves and just allow people to be happy
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont get it who the cares why would anyone even make news of something like this its completely irrelevant to everyone in australia and around the world
nottheonion,not_removed,then their not christians doing that is clearly not biblical
nottheonion,not_removed,so gay marriage ruins the sanctity of marriage so they plan on divorcing and ruining the sanctity of their marriage in order to make a political statement that marriage is sacred when you start going against your own religious views in the name of politics you seriously need to rethink your priorities
nottheonion,not_removed,legal marriage does not equal religious marriage you can completely forgo the service in the church and get married at the city religiously it doesnt really count at least for polish catholics
nottheonion,not_removed,why is this news who the fuck cares
nottheonion,not_removed,that is the most retarded thing ive ever heard people like that make christians seem like hateful morons were not all like that
nottheonion,not_removed,the lack of logic is astounding christian fundi you really dont care if people eat spaghetti with a spoon regular guy i keep telling you i dont care about how or even if other people eat spaghetti christian fundi oh yeah well what if i ate spaghetti with mustard on it regular guy again that would totally be ok with me i literally spend of my day thinking about the spaghetti eating habits of others christian fundi well ill show you from this day forth i will no longer est spaghetti regular guy ok great
nottheonion,not_removed,this is the dumbest thing ive read i feel dumber having read it 😐
nottheonion,not_removed,so
nottheonion,not_removed,weve had same sex marriage in canada for years it didnt destroy heterosexual marriage or the nuclear family there were no plagues of locusts these people are hateful and judgemental they are not christians
nottheonion,not_removed,nobody cares marriage was never a religious institution to begin with anyway the church wasnt even involved until the mid when they decided actually were going to meddle in this as well it has nothing to do with them or their religion it is has always been and will always be a social contract nothing more
nottheonion,not_removed,straya here these people are not typical of the rest of the country so please dont judge us by them i mean normally were just casually racist and dont really care where you put your genitals
nottheonion,not_removed,these two dont understand one common trait that exists in the majority of thinking people that has supported the marriage equality movement and simultaneously preordained this protest as a failure in advance nobody gives a fuck who you are married to
nottheonion,not_removed,the amount of effort and thought these people put into directing how others live their secuality is staggering its like some twisted version of the public of a camgirl
nottheonion,not_removed,are we sure this isnt satire the way this couple describes marriage as timeless and organic sounds exactly how the onion would write it
nottheonion,not_removed,mark what god has joined together let no man separate the bible is more strongly against divorce than it is homosexuality
nottheonion,not_removed,i bet theyre just looking for an excuse to divorce loluh yeah were doing it because the gays have ruined it for us
nottheonion,not_removed,i long for the day religious bigots no longer rule the none believers
nottheonion,not_removed,who cares
nottheonion,not_removed,i really need to ask who gives a fuck
nottheonion,not_removed,theres nothing like getting divorced to protect the sanctity of marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,god hates people getting laid every christian who almost never gets laid
nottheonion,not_removed,sotheyre not really christian yes i mean they promised before god to be wed together til death us do part and all that were they just mocking their god when they took their vows so much for how they view the sanctity of marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,australian here fuck these cunts
nottheonion,not_removed,these people sound like idiots religion and politics dont go together people worrying about things that dont affect them such as samesex marriage still shocks me if anyone who agrees with mr and msjensen could please tell me what samesex marriage has to do with any of their lives thatd be awesome also why do some people of religion let things like this bother them to the point of getting a divorce and defying their own religion
nottheonion,not_removed,as a christian im more spiritual these days not really devout or anything the one thing that always irks me about situations like this is why do you care so much about what other people do with their lives you live next to your neighbors for years and dont give a shit what they do on a daily basis maybe you do maybe youre besties in that case the neighbors further down the street but because tim and fred three states over want to get married suddenly you care so much about people who are insignificant to your everyday living and interactions thats a special kind of hate thats ignorant hate fuck haters of all varieties
nottheonion,not_removed,well if they think anyone gives a shit if they divorce then theyre already divorced from reality
nottheonion,not_removed,it is their right to divorce just as samesex marriage should be next couples right notescher made an interesting point i just would like to know what this couple think to gain by threatening to divorce to somehow speak out against gay people come on people are just people why has civility gone out of the window in the century
nottheonion,not_removed,you see this barren field behind me this is where all my fucks are sown
nottheonion,not_removed,i have a lollipop but i dont want you to have one if you get one im going to throw mine in the dirt
nottheonion,not_removed,because it moves against the foundational block of australian society wasnt the foundational block of australian society a prison
nottheonion,not_removed,okay who cares i had two friends come out recently and has affected nothing in my life
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe this is his way of finally divorcing her so he can marry the boyfriend hes been seeing for the past years
nottheonion,not_removed,this is journalism now search the internet for the biggest weirdos then write an article declaring that their personal lunacy somehow matters or is significant well i guess it beats doing indepth research
nottheonion,not_removed,i think i heard a similar story like this in america the number of fucks anyone gave i believe was around zero
nottheonion,not_removed,the passive aggression of the christ
nottheonion,not_removed,am i really the only one more than a little suspicious about that happy and healthy part i feel like someone suggested this as a way out of a marriage that they were not as christians supposed to want out of and sold it with the well show them
nottheonion,not_removed,dont call yourself a christian couple if you are planning a divorce for protest this is not christian like and you are now just a married couple going against your firm christian beliefs to take a stand god would not approve
nottheonion,not_removed,how about state stop using the word marriage and redefine it a legally partnershipunion then people can marry or whatever they want within there circle
nottheonion,not_removed,i bet one of them secretly wants a divorce and is using this as the perfect cover
nottheonion,not_removed,they actually made the threat back in this site just rehashed the story
nottheonion,not_removed,why do they think anyone would care if they divorce each other this is seriously the dumbest form of protest ive ever seen
nottheonion,not_removed,finally an excuse for us to get the fuck away from each other
nottheonion,not_removed,who cares as long as they dont pollute the minds of children with there believe in an invisible skygod
nottheonion,not_removed,no one cares if they want to throw a hissy fit and try to project their religious dogma on others let them just like a child in a sweets isle ignore them and they will stop throwing a tantrum
nottheonion,not_removed,in order to marry samesex partners
nottheonion,not_removed,hey all in order to protest gun laws im going to shoot myself in the leg
nottheonion,not_removed,im progay marriage why should gay people be happy ill leave now
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe so they can have their own gay marriages
nottheonion,not_removed,talk about a literal zero sum game approach to marriage what theres only so much marriage to go around we can only be happy if others suffer
nottheonion,not_removed,breaking news australian government reconvenes over the holiday weekend to block samesex marriage to prevent this travesty from happening
nottheonion,not_removed,there wasa facebook page celebrating their divorce and it had several thousand likes cant find it anymore it may have been deleted
nottheonion,not_removed,the definition of marriage changes over time it used to be about consolidating wealth and power finding a providerprotector gaining a dowry business transactions between parents adding a second income or pair of hands to the household producing children for labor shifting the responsibility for a woman from her father to her husband and many other things marrying for love thats relatively new
nottheonion,not_removed,good the ceremony is a colossal waste of money undertaken by two people who wish to consolidate and protect their wealth from the government but who just give license to each other to rob the other blind if they ever decide to back out
nottheonion,not_removed,why is this even news like some people have already pointed out marriage wasnt created by christianity tons of people get married outside of religion why do they feel like its ruining their union by allowing same sex couples to get married i swear most religious people cant mind their own business and feel everybody should follow their ideals
nottheonion,not_removed,marriage is indeed timeless religion on the other hand was invented in the last few thousand years its funny how people deconstruct their own arguments
nottheonion,not_removed,this is very old but let me tell you all of australia is rooting for this divorce born again christians are the cancer of australia note the liberal support of israel nomatterperiod
nottheonion,not_removed,it is a sacred institution ordained by god um no marriage was a civil contract between two families long before it was hijacked by religion their protest is to be perfectly blunt utterly moronic the notion that giving the same legal rights to same sex couples somehow devalues marriage is also utterly moronic it is a useless and meaningless gesture made by two bigots
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess i see their point if marriage isnt how god intended it is void however the state made marriage a financial institution years ago its a get rich quick scheme for women and a paycheck for courts it lost its meaning long before same sex marriage came along
nottheonion,not_removed,and the world will carry on and nobody will give a damn the sooner religion is called out for the fairy tale it is the better we will be marriage is nothing more than a carry over of times when religion ruled its a narcissistic ceremony and nothing more i have been together with my wife for years and we didnt need to have some foolish ritual to prove anything to anyone
nottheonion,not_removed,wait samesex marriage isnt legal in australia what year is it there
nottheonion,not_removed,oh no two awful people will split if something wonderful happens no tears from me
nottheonion,not_removed,im looking forward to the inevitable sophistry outlets like fox news put out where theyll frame it as gay people forcing good christians to divorce wont mention that theyre choosing to divorce just omit that little bit of information and let the retards watching you jump to their own conclusions
nottheonion,not_removed,wow let them do they really think people are going to see this as a threat oh no more asshole christians thinking that marriage equality will actually directly negitively affect them smh
nottheonion,not_removed,well thats just more of an incentive
nottheonion,not_removed,to the married i give this charge not i but the lord the wife should not separate from her husband but if she does she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband and the husband should not divorce his wife corinthians but your book
nottheonion,not_removed,good thing that divorce is legal unlike during biblical times
nottheonion,not_removed,and marry same sex partners and have an awkward meeting years later
nottheonion,not_removed,im really ok with this 😀
nottheonion,not_removed,slow news day
nottheonion,not_removed,if our federal parliament votes to change the timeless and organic definition of marriage later on this year it will have moved against the fundamental and foundational building block of astralian society and indeed human culture everywhere human culture everywhere do these people know not everybody is christian that some places and people do not have anything even close to marriage how big of a stick must be up their butts for them to be annoyed at how other people live their lives the one thing i must say tho is i like they are protesting in a non violent way i dont mind people speaking up for their ideals but at the same time holy fuck it makes me so angry that people are this clueless the brothers responds however was absolutely the perfect way of reponding to it
nottheonion,not_removed,they do know that the bible forbids divorce right
nottheonion,not_removed,why cant they just picket the funerals of soldiers killed in combat like the rest of us
nottheonion,not_removed,if amy schumer ever got married this is exactly what she would do
nottheonion,not_removed,sigh the only thing wrong here is that this makes news there are far more important issues than this crap if you ignore them they disappear this is a nonstory in most countries
nottheonion,not_removed,the funny thing is both divorce and living together out of wedlock are sins in christianity
nottheonion,not_removed,they are too concerned about legally protecting the tradition of marriage to waste time learning about laws which currently protect the traditions of marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,you guys have some very archaic laws
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt living together as an unmarried couple living in sin
nottheonion,not_removed,well there are circumstances such as domestic violence where a divorce can be granted without the months
nottheonion,not_removed,have australian divorce can confirm
nottheonion,not_removed,its possible that they know this and want a participation prize anyway
nottheonion,not_removed,im glad to hear this their willingness to divorce demonstrates a weakness of unity that only cheapens the meaning of marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe theyre secretly gay
nottheonion,not_removed,right who gives a shit fucking morons
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah all my gay friends just quit being gay because this story was so fucking gay
nottheonion,not_removed,verbatim what i thought
nottheonion,not_removed,that is exactly what i came to say you go heterosexuals way to show them who has the rights by abandoning your religions sacrament
nottheonion,not_removed,its not about being happy its about sending a message
nottheonion,not_removed,not true i give a shit in fact im willing to move to australia become a citizen and vote for whatever party is pushing for same sex marriage just to see these two split up now if i only had the funds to do so
nottheonion,not_removed,nobody important just a bunch of uptight religious people who will eventually resolve to living with it while claiming that samesex marriage is causing the fabric of society to be ripped to shreds in my experience its the same people who are horribly racist and xenophobic and give good wholehearted religious people a bad rep so yeah nobody important
nottheonion,not_removed,you are correct but they think people will that is their mindset they care about other peoples relationships so they assume everybody will care about theirs its sad really
nottheonion,not_removed,id love to say that i read this while doing my mornings business but im still developing it that would have been the only shit id give these people
nottheonion,not_removed,its the time difference in australia its still
nottheonion,not_removed,why would it have been were really not a very progressive country from the outside australia seems idk laid back but there is a very big disinterest in progression from the government
nottheonion,not_removed,right now its basically a certainty that australia will have gay marriage in the near future though as other people have said its more a symbolic victory since legal partners have the same rights as married people under australian law the only question is how gay marriage will come about labor the left wing party wants to vote it through the parliament and be done with it the liberals the right wing and currently in power party acknowledge that over of australians want it legalized and also realize that their continued refusal to legalize it is giving labor free ammunition to use against them problem is if they just put it through the parliament then it would upset their more socially conservative voters and members so they want to do a plebiscite basically let australia vote on it or not obviously it would be voted yes and then what happens next is out of their hands but theyre being tied up by labor who says that the million dollars to do the plebiscite is wasteful and a shameless political move to pander to their conservative base
nottheonion,not_removed,that is the smartest thing that can be said in a variety of circumstances edit i take it yall got my meaning on the nail xd
nottheonion,not_removed,well you could always go ahead and not marry another gay person
nottheonion,not_removed,but how else will i impose my discriminatory views onto others
nottheonion,not_removed,im gonna steal that youre good with words
nottheonion,not_removed,gay marriage doesnt affect me and their straight divorce wont affect me either
nottheonion,not_removed,please report all intimate activities to the government for religious judgement and moral opinion
nottheonion,not_removed,in california they had to change the name of the defense of marriage act to be something else since gays could already legally marry and they were trying to repeal that and the state disallowed calling that defense of marriage on the ballot
nottheonion,not_removed,hey now those great patriarchs of the bible totally stuck to that onemanonewoman model thats always been abraham oops nope nevermind isaac nope jacob nope well shit we didnt even make it out of the bibles first book there did we maybe skip ahead to other role models of the faith david nope solomon way nope screw that we cant let the bible go getting in the way of making a point and thats assuming he doesnt pass out from all that biblical rape incest
nottheonion,not_removed,its funny becuase they are going to protest one sin by doing another
nottheonion,not_removed,theres nothing about gays being together in the new testament and if they want to follow the old testament i can bet theyre already committing like sins
nottheonion,not_removed,no one cares that they will divorce as should no one care two guys are getting married gay people could use a little misery in their life anyway theyre always to happy imo cant wait till they start getting divorced and losing half their shit like the rest of us
nottheonion,not_removed,i think the actual line of thinking is this governments definition of marriage is no longer valid in my opinion so theyre rejecting that and keeping to their idea of a more right marriage in the eyes of god not man still pretty weird imo but not as ocontradictory as what you suggest
nottheonion,not_removed,its probably just their excuse to divorce they probably hate each other and now they have and excuse to divorce
nottheonion,not_removed,hatred is the perfect cement for the house of bigotry they built together
nottheonion,not_removed,we need to make sure we remind these people to keep their promise to divorce when it happens lets now let them just talk shit and be forgotten
nottheonion,not_removed,i wonder how the conversation went did you read the news today yeah im pissed i know right look youre probably not going to like this but i want a divorce you took the words right out of my mouth it just makes it so meaningless almost blasphemous we might as well be having hedonistic bestiality orgies in a satanic blood ritual i love you so much right now its like we were meant for each other god damn those gays just like in the bible
nottheonion,not_removed,no plans to separate im sure theyll stop having sex though because they wont be married anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,your grandpa sounds like a levelheaded guy
nottheonion,not_removed,this sounds about right id bet money that something happened there but they cant admit it due to some stupid code of ethics and so are looking anywhere for an excuse to break it off
nottheonion,not_removed,lmao i wouldnt put something like that past those dummies
nottheonion,not_removed,good idea you should spread that around some pro life subs
nottheonion,not_removed,love happiness freedom did anyone tell god about all this blasphemy
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont get how someone else affairs affect these people at all without even realizing it they are absolutely being bigots they are publicly lashing out at something that not only doesnt affect them personally at all but most likely something theyve never even experienced or come into contact with its frightening to think they feel they are doing the right thing and are blind to how absurd they sound as human beings
nottheonion,not_removed,and theyve previously stated that they plan to continue to live together coparent and maintain a romantic relationship
nottheonion,not_removed,couldnt agree more there should be no benefits to being married besides a sweet party and a nice ring
nottheonion,not_removed,how will diamond companies make money then the rings are how they get you
nottheonion,not_removed,i left america after the second bush election havent lived there since and im much happier for it
nottheonion,not_removed,they did so with a distinct lack of internet so no one noticed i would guess
nottheonion,not_removed,sits at bar bitterly sipping another drink after divorce the gays did this to me
nottheonion,not_removed,the issue here is not the bible the issue is whoever leads the church they attend is passing down these ideas my girlfriends church has no issue with gays not in the slightest theres a couple older members that have issues but they know its not their place to jump up during a sermon and talk down to them and its these older members that grew up with different church leaders
nottheonion,not_removed,can we have religious marriage and state marriage separated they already are separated you can get a religious marriage without it being recognized by the state just dont apply for a marriage license and you can have a state marriage with zero religious content they just happen to have the same name mainly due to inertia from back when they were considered inseparable
nottheonion,not_removed,because separate but is not equal marriage is a legal contract and consensual adult couples regardless of gender or faith should have the same rights religion personal beliefs and aesthetics should be expressed in your personalized ceremony plain and simple
nottheonion,not_removed,till minorities have their rights respected do us part
nottheonion,not_removed,divorcing the government doesnt mean divorce to god its actually a movement if enough straight people stop marriage that is acknowledge by governments the benefits that came with it will go away history repeats for a reason
nottheonion,not_removed,i think theres a scripture about people disregarding parts of the law in favor of small parts of it
nottheonion,not_removed,dont you fucking dare give me that pizza you wasteful bastard
nottheonion,not_removed,as it always has been thats why adobe costs so much there time travel
nottheonion,not_removed,do you mean there is some part of the world that isnt doing with what we only started last year after being dragged there by the us supreme court astounding
nottheonion,not_removed,the majority of people here support samesex marriage but we currently have a rightwing government so thats that
nottheonion,not_removed,usa legalized it recently not too uncommon
nottheonion,not_removed,yep no celebrities died today so this is what takes our attention
nottheonion,not_removed,the bible has become nothing but trail mix for most people
nottheonion,not_removed,i guarantee you theyre going to continue to be married in the lord or however they put it while being legally divorced from their churchs point of view theyll still be married and committing no sin
nottheonion,not_removed,divorce is recognized in most variants of christianity isnt it
nottheonion,not_removed,divorce as a sin is catholic thing
nottheonion,not_removed,so was being gay until we revised the bible again
nottheonion,not_removed,the lack of marriage equality or actually having to demonstrate that youre serious about divorce
nottheonion,not_removed,a friend of mine who lives in south carolina just got divorced and had to prove hed been separated a year first i think a reasonable amount of states have similar laws assuming youre from us
nottheonion,not_removed,stops people making spur of the moment decisions they either cool their head off and have an easier divorce or realise tensions were just high and stay together
nottheonion,not_removed,your name is amazing is my favorite show always makes me happy to see the rare reference
nottheonion,not_removed,the wife just wants an excuse to not have to put out anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,and its also not christian to divorce anyways so wtf
nottheonion,not_removed,eh americans may not be aware divorcing state license doesnt inherently change a common law marriage this is actually a very british thing to do and historically has been done many many times from alexander hamiltons mother in the western colonies to various interracial marriages before interracial marriages were legal simply put if you were any couple who couldnt marry in the state you just got a common law marriage and wrote your will to the partner likewise divorcing someone in the state in protest and then marrying someone by common law goes as far back as the dark ages
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah they just wanna divorce so they can remarry people of their own gender
nottheonion,not_removed,such plot twist
nottheonion,not_removed,the jensens are swingers
nottheonion,not_removed,that would be the greens or the sex party but unfortunately those parties have no power at all and the two major parties havent finished milking the gay marriage issue for media coverage yet so they wont resolve this very simple issue
nottheonion,not_removed,im in australia ill save you some money and vote for it for you course we shouldnt even need an expensive vote for this its a stupid waste of money just do it ffs
nottheonion,not_removed,the fabric of society had already been ripped apart thats why shows like married at first sight exist
nottheonion,not_removed,no no no they arent bigoted didnt you read the article he said so s
nottheonion,not_removed,hm thats an interesting perspective i never thought about it that way
nottheonion,not_removed,mainly in queensland
nottheonion,not_removed,well in years as of tomorrow youre in for a hell of a time tons of people that are famous are going to die youll elect someone who thinks the best plan is to have an arms race with other countries for nuclear weapons and youre gonna lose a gorilla just a fair warning
nottheonion,not_removed,i think i assumed it was more progressive because of your astronomical minimum wage ive never really thought about it before
nottheonion,not_removed,in my head always think of australia as southern hemisphere canada
nottheonion,not_removed,the liberals are the right wing party in australia
nottheonion,not_removed,doesnt really work with murder
nottheonion,not_removed,its a quote if you like this clip i encourage you to watch his specials on netflix
nottheonion,not_removed,had this discussion with my motherinlaw i asked her how exactly it would affect her if there was marriage equality she claimed it would cheapen her marriage i pointed out she wasnt actually married just had lived with the same guy for odd years after getting a divorce from another guy and yet the law accepts her rights as a spouse anyway i didnt get a response she suddenly had to be somewhere else
nottheonion,not_removed,i genuinely do not understand how your quoted verse adds any support to your point i am not disagreeing with you im just really not sure that i follow what youre saying my understanding of this verse is that its really just the same idea as till death do us part
nottheonion,not_removed,fun fact if you suspect that your wife is cheating on you the bible prescribes bitterwater which is apparently holy water if the woman cheats the water causes a miscarriage if shes innocent then nothing happens theres also a side of public shaming in the form of ripping her dress to expose her heart and in some cases her boobs so its a biblical abortion so if that woman did cheat according to the bible he has to make her drink water destroy her clothes and wait for a dead baby to pop out and since magic isnt real no dead baby pops out shes just gotten a free drink
nottheonion,not_removed,im pretty sure lots daughters drug him and fuck him so in that case its both rape and incest twoinone oh and the bible also says if your daughter is raped you sell her to her rapist because he now owns her like physically owns her
nottheonion,not_removed,most christians are quick to dismiss the old testament most of the time except when picking their favorite sins from leviticus the new testament actually does have some stuff in there thats pretty clear on one wife being an important thing not mandatory in general just a requirement to hold particular leadership roles in the church
nottheonion,not_removed,i would love to read your translation of the bible
nottheonion,not_removed,just slightly but the jist is there lol
nottheonion,not_removed,theres nothing about gays being together in the new testament where do people get this homosexuality is mentioned in the new testament
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks for that every white male comedian since the mid nineties
nottheonion,not_removed,that was my first thought the guy has probably been wanting a divorce for years and he finally has an excuse that wont make his church hate him lol
nottheonion,not_removed,starebonits times like this that i feel the need to emphasize that i used to go to a church with a homosexual man whod frequently be seen with his partner around towneveryone knew and it was no big deal not all us christians are this crazy you just never see a newspaper headline titled christian man declares hes okay with homosexuality
nottheonion,not_removed,well old testament god was kind of a prick so at least its in character
nottheonion,not_removed,even though having sex out of wedlock is a sin in like every christian church
nottheonion,not_removed,i highly doubt the jewelery industry relies on marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,couldnt agree more one of my favorite sermons was about this it was around the time that crazy church was protesting during funerals pastor started off showing a picture of one of the protesters and said god doesnt hate gays god doesnt hate anyone and god isnt talking to that crazy man telling him to say those awful things then he went into how christianity is about loving each other and unconditional love from god we are all flawed and even the holiest person still has sin and can only be saved because of gods mercy you are not saved by good deeds you are not saved by only committing lesser sins all sins are equal just love so stop with the holier than thou christianity has a bad rap from people talking down to non christians and pretending that being christian automatically makes you a better person it does not he also said that those who worship every week arent better christians than those that come at just christmas and easter they are both christians or those that tithe are better than those that dont give it doesnt matter there are no ranks or levels of christians try to be a good person but you will stumble and fall thats ok pick yourself up and try again you dont need to judge others just focus on yourself for if god loves everyone so should you unfortunately those who spew hate seem to get all the attention and all christians are lumped together by the action of a few
nottheonion,not_removed,i think what he meant is calling heterosexual marriages civil unions as well
nottheonion,not_removed,funny how they can accept a distinction between the legal institution of marriage and the religious institution of marriage when it suits them
nottheonion,not_removed,what you mean people twist the words of their holy book of choice to fit their own agendas while condemning the actions of others say it isnt so
nottheonion,not_removed,jesus litterally said so they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what god has joined together let no one separate i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for sexual immorality and marries another woman commits adultery christians are such hypocrites
nottheonion,not_removed,funny how nobody has to demonstrate that theyre serious about marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,you can be serious about a divorce and be forced to cohabit for financial reasons during the separation phase id say its more about how theyre determining seriousness for that bit at least
nottheonion,not_removed,a little of column a a little of column b
nottheonion,not_removed,yes
nottheonion,not_removed,who jokes about divorce who takes it lightly what does it mean to demonstrate that serious about divorce yeah its archaic to demand that a married couple live apart but legally married for months before the state will grant a divorce
nottheonion,not_removed,the second one
nottheonion,not_removed,its days in utah
nottheonion,not_removed,in michigan you just pay the fee to file the papers and then wait for the scheduled court date filed in october last year they gave us a january court date about a week later no fault state didnt have to do anything other than just say yes when the judge asked if there was no possibility of reconciliation
nottheonion,not_removed,correct its often faster to move to another state and file for divorce there
nottheonion,not_removed,north carolina also requires a year separation
nottheonion,not_removed,unfortunately it also stops people making spur of the moment good decisions like leaving an abusive partner and court mandated mediation bullshit like the kind that lead to that poor womans murder recently
nottheonion,not_removed,is no fault the same as irreconcilable difference that i frequently hear about
nottheonion,not_removed,now lets hear you pronounce it
nottheonion,not_removed,on that note question there are essentially two kinds of marriage the religious sacrament and the legal status its not exactly like christianity has a monopoly the concept of marriage people have been doing it for thousands of years before jesus came along yes when you get married in a church theyre often licensed or whatever to get you a legal certificate as well but as far as a state government is concerned you can just show up at the courthouse and get a marriage certificate without religion getting involved at all so since you can get legally married without religious significance can you get married without legal significance i dont really see why not meaning that said couple could get divorced legally forfeiting any tax benefits or whatever but still living together and being seen as married by their church wouldnt be surprised if thats what theyre actually doing
nottheonion,not_removed,unless you are anglican that church was founded on the concept of divorce henry viii created the church of england because the pope wouldnt let him divorce his first wife which later became the anglican church
nottheonion,not_removed,christian i know a lot of conservative christians who are traditionalist and antigayabortion but theyre still respectful and genuine with their progressive and gay coworkers had a lot of great conversations during the election
nottheonion,not_removed,its a great christian demonstration to be a bigot
nottheonion,not_removed,yep it is really frowned upon in christianity i remember when my parents were going through a divorce the church of christ sent their goons over to our house to persuade them
nottheonion,not_removed,stupid is a stoopid does frorest guump
nottheonion,not_removed,that was my first thought
nottheonion,not_removed,as long as hes willing to attempt to bang the guys wife ill chip in
nottheonion,not_removed,greens are not at all powerless they have great negotiating power in the senate they have senate seats on their own labor only has as such if labor wants to block something they require the greens httpwwwaphgovausenatorsandmemberssenatorssenatecomposition
nottheonion,not_removed,as well as the labor nick xenophon team pirate party etc
nottheonion,not_removed,thats why we have preferential voting all it takes for sex and greens to gain power is for enough people to think theyre less bad than labiaral
nottheonion,not_removed,no kidding or so percent of us think it should be legal im pretty sure over percent of politicians believe it should be legal why should we throw money into supporting both sides of a debate that is already over get your shit together politicians and vote on it yourselves with your electorates general opinion you cunts
nottheonion,not_removed,glad im not the only one being bugged by ads for that shit while trying to watch the fucking cricket the fact that shows like that even get off the drawing board stage shows that marriage as a sacred vow thing to be full of shit and i just know its a huge slap on the face of same sex couples would love to be able to get married this country is fucked
nottheonion,not_removed,astronomical minimum wage comes from our astronomical cost of living not because the government are such swell guys
nottheonion,not_removed,have you seen how damn expensive games are in australia madness
nottheonion,not_removed,thats new zealand bro
nottheonion,not_removed,liberal as a term to the rest of the world is someone who is socially left and a mix of left and right economically tending to the right here in the us liberal means anything to the left of reagan but elsewhere in the world calling someone a liberal is akin to calling someone a republican that is cool with things like gay marriage also this is partly why us politics veers so hard right and why liberal was pushed as a slur word by the foxes and breitbarts and koch foundations you paint the middle as far left and then the shift happens
nottheonion,not_removed,its because originally the liberal party i believe were founded as classical liberals supporting freedom of the individual over time though they have drifted over to conservatism in the social side of things while they maintain their support for economic liberalism if it was founded nowadays no doubt the party would have a different name though
nottheonion,not_removed,yes
nottheonion,not_removed,if youre against murder dont marry a gay person can do
nottheonion,not_removed,well murder is an act with a victim so circumstances should just be replaced with victimless acts and it should be fine
nottheonion,not_removed,this is why some people fail when arguing against abortion prolifers see it as murder so any arguments just focusing on what the woman wantsneeds will fail it is about the status of the fetus
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks for letting me know id always heard about him but never checked out his stuff for whatever reason guess i should probably do that
nottheonion,not_removed,hiring your assassin perhaps
nottheonion,not_removed,cheapen her marriage is it like gold wherein if there is too much in the market it becomes less valuable lets solve that problem make everyone divorce then its value goes up
nottheonion,not_removed,fox news told her it cheapens her marriage when confronted about it she had not thought about it further than that
nottheonion,not_removed,i think his point is that the bible doesnt permit them to divorce not sure though
nottheonion,not_removed,theyre not supposed to break apart what god has joined as christians youd think they would pay more attention to what the bible says about marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,no divorce
nottheonion,not_removed,any and every person who curses his father or mother must be put to death saying fuck you mom youre not the boss of me warrants the murder of a child im amazed at how many religious folk dont know how batshit insane their holy book is
nottheonion,not_removed,terrific these stone age desert people seem to have known everything about how to run society lets not change a thing and apply their rules to our modern life im sure itll work out great
nottheonion,not_removed,oh and the bible also says if your daughter is raped you sell her to her rapist because he now owns her like physically owns her i think that the guy had to marry her as well so he couldnt get what he wanted from her and dump her
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah i hear you on the listeningtontoverot except when the ot encourages stoning deviants or when someones wigging out over commandments in a courthouse fwiw though bible studies id been in before had explained that passage about bishops being husband of one wife as more an injunction against divorce remarriage for early church leaders since the social norms by then had moved away from polygamy in the roman world including judea am not enough of a biblical scholar and dont care enough to look further though also i get that in a historical context much of the ditching of ot things like kosher laws were meant to facilitate expansion of christianity from a messianic movement in judaism to the dominant roman greek civilization i still get peeved whenever this always gets quoted by fundamentalists no it has not been always just for a lot of history in the west except when it wasnt
nottheonion,not_removed,hey you cant just pick and choose from gods words or can you
nottheonion,not_removed,they dismiss the old testament but sure do love those ten commandments
nottheonion,not_removed,wwwpidginbibleorg
nottheonion,not_removed,i think he captured the spirit of the passage too
nottheonion,not_removed,in all fairness chris rock made the same joke so just every male comedian from the nineties would be more accurate
nottheonion,not_removed,jeez no leg room on airplanes amirite
nottheonion,not_removed,i think the main reason is that this is a stupid thing to get up in arms about sure you dont see christian man declares hes okay with homosexuality because httpwwwaustralianmarriageequalityorgwhosupportsequalityamajorityofaustralianssupportmarriageequality people like to pick out stuff like this and make stories about it because its silly stupid theyre not the ones that are getting married to someone of the same sex theyre not involved in the marriage in any way so why get so angry and say stupid things like this
nottheonion,not_removed,that title sounds like something off the onion
nottheonion,not_removed,not all religious people are antigay but practically all antigay people are religious
nottheonion,not_removed,now with more vitamin fuck you
nottheonion,not_removed,what was that jesus said about neighbours judge the shit out of anyone different from you i think something like that
nottheonion,not_removed,to his credit he did mellow out some when he had a kid
nottheonion,not_removed,well a fair percentage of people are into mild sm things like handcuffs so a tinier shackle to be worn all day is bound to excite at least some people
nottheonion,not_removed,thats what pisses me off about the australian garbage excuse to not legalise samesex marriage church and state are supposed to be seperate but noone here gives a damn because its a christian country ridiculous
nottheonion,not_removed,its almost like they are proper cunts funny that
nottheonion,not_removed,exactly all of my upvotes
nottheonion,not_removed,as a very nonreligious catholic i really dont understand it somehow samesex legal marriage is nono because of religious reasons yet the church doesnt recognize a stateonly marriage as a valid one if youre saying that people that werent married by a priest are not married in the eyes of god and live in sin then what do you care who theyre notmarried to
nottheonion,not_removed,accepting things only when it suits them is the hallmark of holier than thou religious nutbags theyll continue to eat shellfish wear polyester and shave their beards but continue to quote leviticus when it comes to condemning the gays
nottheonion,not_removed,funny
nottheonion,not_removed,kinda like with kids making one is all fine and easy so many people are doing it that really shouldnt but if you dont want any abortion getting snipped or just not trying despite being in a stable relationship and its the end of the world in some peoples minds
nottheonion,not_removed,bruh i knew what it was going to be before i even clicked on it
nottheonion,not_removed,porque no los dos ¯ツ¯
nottheonion,not_removed,you can cohabit but if so you have to demonstrate that its not marriage like
nottheonion,not_removed,only rich people can afford to divorce evidently
nottheonion,not_removed,in texas you just need then there is a day waiting period but the waiting period is apparently not required
nottheonion,not_removed,you can qualify for a gun purchase faster than you can get divorced
nottheonion,not_removed,for all the wives
nottheonion,not_removed,irreconcilable differences is more of a catch all one party can be completely responsible for the failure of the marriage or both parties no fault is basically both parties agreeing to go their separate ways if i understand it properly and the division of property and such has usually all been hashed out by the couple instead of in arbitration
nottheonion,not_removed,there is a ritual thats become popular in neopagan communities called handfasting thats a religious nonlegallybinding marriage its often entered into on a limited term such as for ayear and a day or may be dissolved by mutual consent
nottheonion,not_removed,can you get married without legal significance absolutely anybody can conduct a marriage its really only a question of who will recognize that marriage recognition is what confers benefits if yourethe officiant is not registered as an officiant with the state the state wont recognize your marriage so you wont get the government benefits associated with it if yourethe officiant is not an ordained member of a particular religion that religion probably wont recognize your marriage so you wont get the religioussocial benefits associated with it said couple could get divorced legally forfeiting any tax benefits or whatever but still living together and being seen as married by their church thats almost certainly what theyre doing essentially telling the state to butt out of their marriage which you know hooray for them for acting on their personal convictions in a way that doesnt harm anyone i wish more people with silly beliefs would express them this way instead of trying to force them on others edit too many yous it was confusing
nottheonion,not_removed,you certainly can get married religiously without legal significance my grandfather and his current wife got married in a catholic church with the express understanding that legally speaking they were not married they are both in the and didnt want any issues with inheritance coming up when either died but also didnt want to live in sin both are quite catholic
nottheonion,not_removed,yes i imagine thats exactly their idea to highlight the distinction between legal and religious significance
nottheonion,not_removed,thats how polygamists do it
nottheonion,not_removed,this is exactly what they are doing and to be honest i cant really fault them for it if legal marriage is redefined to be inconsistent with their beliefs then they should be free to disolve that recognition in australia there are very few remaining legal differences with respect to rights and privileges for married couples or those in a civil union except that a marriage is harder to disolve the danger if this line of thinking takes hold is that a significant portion of the population will avoid legal recognition altogether the justification for legal marriage is not to foster loving relationships legal marriage first and foremost provides a statutory framework for the legal management of disputes in relationships and succession law without legal marriage family law gets much much messier than it already is importantly if religious groups turn away from civil family law they will most likely transition that recognition of authority away from the judicial function of the state and seek it from church leadership
nottheonion,not_removed,they like traditional marriage one man one woman and more women if you got the money or one man and occasionally one kid wtf marrying your kids is traditional marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,went to court house to get married because im not religious and we wanted a fun wedding my wifes aunt officiated bc fuck it right ill be damned if the justice of the peace didnt mention god like times i just smiled and nodded because as early fuck it right us here assumed more seperation of state and church but i am in texas so who knows
nottheonion,not_removed,yes you can it can cause some legal issues though like if you were to try and bring someone over on a fiancé visa if the consulate somehow found out you partook in a religious ceremony akin to a wedding the only thing missing being the certificate basically they wont grant the but you also cant go for a spouse visa because you have no paper proof of the marriage dont know any other issues it could cause in the world
nottheonion,not_removed,for australia at least its largely irrelevant the de facto relationships act introduced the legal idea that any cohabiting personal relationship of years or more is given the same rights and responsibilities as a legal marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,in australia marriage celebrants are legally required to state that marriage is specifically between a man and a woman when performing a civil ceremony its why so many people choose to ignore civil authority altogether and conduct a service of their own fuck the christian right
nottheonion,not_removed,im a pastor and this is actually the way i wish it worked as a christian i dislike both that the government has a say in our marriage ritual and that im an agent of the state when i do weddings i would prefer if there were two completely separate processes a religious ceremony to be recognized by the church and a legal process t be recognized by the state
nottheonion,not_removed,my phone has been acting up so i hope this replies to the right comment its supposed to be to the one questioning marriage in the religious sense rather than the legal sense my dad is an ordained christian preacher and the biggest thing hes always preached is basically sex that its god given and therefore good and why would he make it feel good and required for repopulating if it wasnt meant to be enjoyed bc of this he believes that if youre having sex with someone then youre married in the religious sense if you dont do long term relationships or frequent one night stands then im not sure if its seen that way but i never asked so im not sure what his opinion on that is but for long term people when you have sex youre married he has specified that rapes dont count for obvious reasons i can go into detail on why if you like also this would apply to either hetero or homo relationships doesnt matter as long as its consensual possibly even polyamorous ive not brought that subject up with him though
nottheonion,not_removed,of course turning things around a bit im friends with a samesex couple who got married in a religious ceremony several years before their state started recognizing samesex marriages the religious ceremony was a big todo and afterwards they their families and friends all considered them as a married couple a couple years later they had a small gathering and went down to the courthouse to make it legal they do mark that as an important date but they dont consider it their wedding day
nottheonion,not_removed,this is actually pretty common in the catholic church to be officially divorced in the eyes of the catholic church a couple has to get an annulment which can only be given by the pope himself the whole process takes months and is a huge pain so many people just avoid doing it and only get a legal divorce however since they are still married in the church if either of these people ever have another relationship they are said to be commuting adultery and are living in sin if they do this they are also not allowed to take communion source years of catholic schooling and one of my parents is in this situation
nottheonion,not_removed,i completely agree and as a christian i cannot understand why many if not most of my fellow believers cannot wrap their heads around this fact
nottheonion,not_removed,didnt know this
nottheonion,not_removed,ironically those who did divorce had a lot of social stigma well into the century at least for royalty eg edward viii princess margaret prince charles and princess diana were all scorned for their divorces or affairs with divorced people
nottheonion,not_removed,creepy i went to a catholic school and my boyfriend didnt and now all the things i say we learned sound so cultynot to offend any catholics but this shit is a little bit too far out there they talk about gays being the strange ones but
nottheonion,not_removed,i was talking about httpsenwikipediaorgwikicommonwealthofnations
nottheonion,not_removed,areare you sure you dont seem sure
nottheonion,not_removed,as long as hes willing to attempt to bang the guys wife ill chip in
nottheonion,not_removed,that blokes wife will run ya not man
nottheonion,not_removed,liberals are being strangled by the hard right of the party
nottheonion,not_removed,id already assumed you guys had legalised it down there
nottheonion,not_removed,yet none of them bitch about that yep just bigotry
nottheonion,not_removed,lived in queensland for a year just because its further north doesnt make the better p
nottheonion,not_removed,makes that look like
nottheonion,not_removed,as a canadian i consider new zealand our natural twin at the opposite end of the world australia seems like the usa of that relationship with nz though australia is more sane then usa in politics theyd be more right wing than canada for sure canadas natural tilt is centrecentre left australia seems centrecentreright also i need to come out that as a gay dude something about those pics of former pm tony abbott in a speedo did something for me lol a bigot but an in shape guy im weird
nottheonion,not_removed,ill update my travel arrangements
nottheonion,not_removed,the liberals here in aus are largely socially conservative although there are small l liberals like malcolm turnbull not that it makes much difference though
nottheonion,not_removed,ooooh boy jerry
nottheonion,not_removed,ah the old reddit
nottheonion,not_removed,i was amused by this for a good seconds straight gay
nottheonion,not_removed,no no no if youre against gay marriage dont murder a gay person
nottheonion,not_removed,unfortunately they usually believe gay marriage does have a victim society or the children the couple might adopt my mother is adamant that gay relationships are abusive to children
nottheonion,not_removed,to them it is but to me at least the prolife argument still doesnt hold up even if i assume it counts as a life
nottheonion,not_removed,i think his older stuff is better he was less preachy granted it might just be because i got into him early and preferred his old style
nottheonion,not_removed,hated the fact we lived together for a year before getting married on the contrary grams everyone should do that because not knowing if you can live with someone before you get married to them is stupid
nottheonion,not_removed,thats called projecting class this lesson brought to you by armchair psychologists of rddt school bell rings
nottheonion,not_removed,its truly amazing how grandma turned into a pious defender of the faith after she spent her younger years on her back getting layers of dick huh
nottheonion,not_removed,my gramma does the same shit just about lost her mind when we adopted my niece niece told her that its okay because we love each other wasnt having any of grammas shit lol
nottheonion,not_removed,close but fox news isnt really a thing here
nottheonion,not_removed,i could be wrong but my guess is the bible refers to marriage as a religious institution and unity not a governmental one you can get divorced by the state and still be in religious union
nottheonion,not_removed,ok cool thanks for responding i got a shit ton of pms from others who felt i was being dumb but i really just didnt follow your train of thought in citing the verse i wasnt trying to start some religious debate on biblical inconsistencies
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought it was a joke but it wasnt thats amazing
nottheonion,not_removed,now i need to know if someone made an urban dictionary translation of the bible
nottheonion,not_removed,its still all the white ones i didnt say only the white ones
nottheonion,not_removed,airline food right
nottheonion,not_removed,rtheydidthefuckyou
nottheonion,not_removed,actually there is no separation of church and state clause in the australian constitution there is however a clause preventing an official federal or state religion so to create laws that back the beliefs of any specific religion is off the cards it sounds like a semantic difference but in practice its what allowed tony to funnel money into the school chaplaincy programme for the record im deeply opposed to the involvement of religion in politics school life on any level these are just facts that i know
nottheonion,not_removed,and why are we a christian country i know too many people who tick that box on the census despite not being religious at all too many people think they have to for false reasons then those statistics are used against their actual beliefs
nottheonion,not_removed,same with the us religious views shouldnt get to dictate what is and isnt legal and yet we see it again and again regarding lgbt rights abortionwomens health etc im nonreligious and have no problem with people practicing their religion even if it instills bigoted views but when people start to act on those views either personally or through legislation it makes me see red
nottheonion,not_removed,redditors will likely hate hearing this so im bracing for downvotes separation of church and state is a separation of churches as institutions from the state its not a promise that the government and its representatives must never let their religion influence their politics if a nation is overwhelmingly christian and passes laws that are influenced by that that does not violate the separation of church and state so long as the pope isnt on the government payroll and the legislators arent on the churchs payroll its legally fine basically church does not mean religion and it never has its basically saying no theocracy no church of england no clerics holding political power that said i think any law that stems from someones self imposed moral code rather than the best interests of the nation is deplorable
nottheonion,not_removed,same with adoption any idiot can make a child or that they then cant provide for the children are left with abusiveneglectfulabsent parents but should a childless couple or any gender want to adopt or a couple with children want to adopt its a case of fill out forms have home checks and compatibility checks jump through flaming hoops of varying sizes only to be rejected because they might discipline their child too harshly a friend of our family was rejected here in northern ireland because they thought removing the childs things would be too harsh of a punishment for bad behaviour the whole adoption process is fucked up
nottheonion,not_removed,hopefully the amount of reckless people having kids doesnt outweigh the amount of responsible stable people having kids otherwise things in your societycommunity can get very very bad there is a worrying trend in some developed nations for a successful professional couple not to have children if that becomes the norm these countries will really suffer
nottheonion,not_removed,i personally hoped for
nottheonion,not_removed,its not a marriage at all your honour we have sex all the time
nottheonion,not_removed,presumably a stat dec would do the job anyway its not as if the family court hires investigators
nottheonion,not_removed,its easy to get into a financial bind through divorce most people live on a budget and a divorce will certainly throw that out of whack if it doesnt ruin you financially there are so many expenses involved even if its civil plus the loss of shared income
nottheonion,not_removed,no any people who can earn a living on their own that should be most of us
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe thats the point
nottheonion,not_removed,handfasting sounds like an oldtimey word for nofap
nottheonion,not_removed,i always dreamed of having a handfasting like this just for all the above reasons everything ive read too clearly states that if you merry part no one will hold it against you and everythings cool i dig that kind of mentality for all that its kinda unrealistic
nottheonion,not_removed,has become popular is a bit of a misnomer handfasting became popular in the and pagan communities have been doing variations of it since source grew up with a pagan parent
nottheonion,not_removed,handfasting has been around for a while and yea its pretty much that
nottheonion,not_removed,can be legally binding with the proper paperwork
nottheonion,not_removed,hand fasting is so much more important to me than actual legal marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,i know people who had a handfasting who are indeed legally married and it was done to be nonreligious
nottheonion,not_removed,indeed i can say im married to that rock over there but its meaningless if nobody recognizes it
nottheonion,not_removed,in which case good for them the sooner religious people realize that gay couples wanting a civil union legally doesnt ruin their religious ceremony the better i dont think thats this couples goal though i think theyre more trying to make a point while hoping no one notices them exploiting a loophole
nottheonion,not_removed,some
nottheonion,not_removed,that might just be a texan thing will let you know if i ever get married
nottheonion,not_removed,that might just be a texan thing will let you know if i ever get married
nottheonion,not_removed,and furthermore you cant divorce if you still live in an active relationship you have to be apart for at least months you can still live in the same house but you may not live as partners so no sleeping in the same bed for example no comingling of finances etc
nottheonion,not_removed,well there already is two separate processes isnt there your religious ceremony is the wedding with whatever ritual and fanfare is desired the legal process is the paperwork your agency to the state seems to be nothing more than as a witness to the intent of the couple what makes that an issue for you personally
nottheonion,not_removed,where are you from i thought this was fairly common knowledge across the anglosphere incidentally henrys church still prohibited remarriage whilst your former spouse was alive which was kind of a non issue when you could just have your exwives executed
nottheonion,not_removed,thats an overly simplistic explanation but certainly henrys inability to get papal dispensation for his marriage was a catalyst or even the primary catalyst for his gradual break from the catholic church and eventual creation of the church of england
nottheonion,not_removed,out of curiousity what do you find culty and too far out there im a catholic studies and theology major and i find a lot of problems tend to stem from certain cultural or area specific tendencies than actual church stuff minus the obvious things like crusades sex abuse scandal etc im always interested in what others find crazy about catholicism though i totally get the eucharist being crazy that is a mind boggler no matter what
nottheonion,not_removed,ive never been more certain about anything
nottheonion,not_removed,why not both theyll all be single
nottheonion,not_removed,as long as the wife does some pegging ill match your donation i said i live paycheck to paycheck to some folks that were collecting for starving children in africa a few days before christmas i didnt have anything to spare this charitable cause means that much to me
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,nah not yet but its not far off the pollys just need to stop people tossbags arguing over who wants it less its really sad because its stopping people from living their lives
nottheonion,not_removed,hold my sexual orientation im going in
nottheonion,not_removed,hold my biblical cherrypicking im going in
nottheonion,not_removed,now you have to marry him
nottheonion,not_removed,if they applied that logic though they wouldnt have a problem with gay people getting married by the government its convenient when you pick and choose your logic though
nottheonion,not_removed,you asre technically correct the best kind of correct
nottheonion,not_removed,food right
nottheonion,not_removed,i wasnt aware of that thank you
nottheonion,not_removed,this is actually the way the us constitution was written also separation of church and state happened through the court system interpretation
nottheonion,not_removed,in my family the excuse against progression is always were a christian country i myself believe that to be absolute garbage but those in power traditionally come off as such
nottheonion,not_removed,the problem is the church tends to think it has the right to legislate peoples behavior it doesnt christians and i am one so im not being facetious need to stop telling people what to do and judging them when they dont do that thats not what christianity is supposed to be about its supposed to be about love loving god and loving others but when you look at the current churches today who judge people they deem are sinning you dont see that and its sad e wow did not expect this many responses thanks all for keeping the discussion civil and for being so polite spelled facetious wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,as i non religious person i had no problem with other people being religious until i realized theyll never ever stay in their fucking lane
nottheonion,not_removed,what i find really frustrating as well is that people who want to legislate based on religion dont see how that could ever bite them in the ass in the future separation of church and state is not simply to protect the nonreligious from the religious but to protect religious people of any faith or denomination from each other so many religious rightwingers are terrified of sharia law taking over the us yet they would be happy to set a precedent of basing the legal code off of religious doctrine its so amazingly hypocritical
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree up to the even if it instills bigoted view my tolerance does not extend to putting up with people who would harm me or those i love if your religion preaches oppression and violence you and it can get fucked
nottheonion,not_removed,why would somebody dislike hearing that
nottheonion,not_removed,i assumed this is because theres more people trying to adopt than children especially white kids which are in high demand
nottheonion,not_removed,ha yeah that one is even better
nottheonion,not_removed,throw it away
nottheonion,not_removed,if i had a nickel for every lost arm on reddit id have over quatloos
nottheonion,not_removed,true but if you are publicised as divorcing entirely because you dont want to be married then chances are the court may actually investigate since you are doing it for publicity not to get a divorce because you cannot reconcile
nottheonion,not_removed,making a false statutory declaration is a criminal offence
nottheonion,not_removed,theres a joke there somewhere honeyback trial period i dunno who cares the fucked up thing is that i could have a gun by noon if i wanted fucking texas
nottheonion,not_removed,kill her before the legal battle
nottheonion,not_removed,not to be confused with fasthanding the oldtimey practice of competitive speed fapping
nottheonion,not_removed,ive been handfasting for close to hours now wish me luck
nottheonion,not_removed,and i said what about breakfast at tiffanys
nottheonion,not_removed,its not unrealistic at all its pretty much the other way around its actually christianity and other mainstream religions but christianity is the major cultural influence in the usa that creates the extremely unrealistic expectations of relationships and then blames the individuals when the expectations didnt pan out society including friends and family blames the individuals the individuals blame each other no one blames the bullshit psychologically unlikely completely delusional ideology that told two people who barely know each other that they have to spend the rest of their lives together and that if they believe hard enough that will make up for the fact that humans simply werent built to behave this way most of the time the more we gain an evidencebased understanding of human psychology the more disordered and delusional the christian version of psychological bullshit looks stand by your man dont get a divorce marriage is forever never sleep with anyone until you marry them and above all else stick to the gender and plumbing thats opposite yours no matter what never stick your parts in the wrong holes or a sky ghost will get very angry furthermore the more evidence that piles up about realworld human psychology the more we start to see correlations between the neopagan traditions and the healthiest and most welladjusted behaviors for our species of course the christians will tell you otherwise but their psychology literally came from an ancientworld breeder cult they picked a set of rules that would help them control women and keep their population under strict social control then they claimed that this was a what god wants and b is objectively good for us because reasons think about it how many times have you seen christian religious practitioners claim that marriage and happiness are synonymous and seen this lifestyle play out exactly the opposite so who really has the unrealistic expectations
nottheonion,not_removed,so its the same as just being in a normal unwed relationship
nottheonion,not_removed,like dust i have cleared from my eye
nottheonion,not_removed,i read it not as that rock but the rock
nottheonion,not_removed,you have to consummate the marriage before i recognize it
nottheonion,not_removed,im from ontariocanada thats crazy the more you know
nottheonion,not_removed,everything about lent all the rituals at mass the whole no lesbians or gays no babies before marriage we had teachers who had to lie about their lifestyles to be teachers uniforms i got suspended for wearing yellow socks once
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,all just how many people were in this marriage
nottheonion,not_removed,meeseeks boyo
nottheonion,not_removed,why limit yourself to only
nottheonion,not_removed,im not touching that thing it looksused
nottheonion,not_removed,hold my dong im going in if youre into that sort of thing
nottheonion,not_removed,bows
nottheonion,not_removed,i mean whats the deal with cereal
nottheonion,not_removed,im glad there are some people that view their religion for what its supposed to be religion shouldnt dictate law or human rights but it sadly still does im glad you can look at what you believe in and see its flaws cause theres a lot of fundamental crazies that think their thinking is perfect im atheist if you or anyone else happening to read this are wondering
nottheonion,not_removed,as an atheist i have to say that people like you restore my faith in religious people whether its truth or misguided religion could be such a force for peace and tolerance leaving judgement to a deity and all that but it so rarely seems to be
nottheonion,not_removed,you worded that absolutely beautifully and i couldnt agree more if everyone spent as much effort loving with open arms and being accepting of others no matter what as they did judging the world would be an entirely different and better place
nottheonion,not_removed,some christians believe they are going to be judged by god for the things they have done on earth other believe they just had to pick the right team and proclaim i believe to become the chosen people well god doesnt need your praise he needs you to want to stop being dicks to each other not you specifically just to this thread in general
nottheonion,not_removed,agreed i am a catholic and i dont give a damn if your gay or transgender i dont care you can be you and i can be me some people take this stuff too far while some me just go on with life it wont effect me unless i get hit on by a dude or something
nottheonion,not_removed,the satanic temple has been useful in testing how happy american christians are with religions having special privileges
nottheonion,not_removed,note that i said unless they act on it if someones religion makes them think wow i really hate gay people and all they do is think that theres unfortunately not much they can do to change their mind however if one harasses or assaults me for being queer or anyone else for that matter then i have a major problem with it
nottheonion,not_removed,yup and because there is precedence to believe from the stories of orphans an adoptees the world over in lax systems that easypeasy external adoptions as in outside of ones kin group often lead to child abuse and not just the strict parent kind the really fucking horrible kind id be willing to bet that there would be just as many wouldbe child exploiters who would be looking to adopt if the process was easy as there would be earnest good samaritans and intending parents who cant conceive if you look at orphanage adoption stories from it becomes clear that many people saw adopting a child as a form of indentured servitude or sadly much worse than that
nottheonion,not_removed,oh please everyday before middle school i used to fast hand edit i dont like having boners in classrooms everyone would see my chocolate meat stick
nottheonion,not_removed,rtheocho

nottheonion,not_removed,for the uninitiated why would those fields allow text input instead of just choosing he or she its pronouns right so even transgender people will just make the binary choice of heshe according to what they feel comfortable with i may be ignorant but ive never heard of a case of someone saying my gender is so unique generic pronouns just dont cut it for me

nottheonion,not_removed,if everyone has silly pronouns i wonder if theyll backpedal and drop the preferred pronoun thing
nottheonion,not_removed,holy shit i know this guy well done grant

nottheonion,not_removed,did not expect to live to see the day universities stopped being centers of learning enlightenment and rationality and become something this silly glad some students are pointing it out as if teachers and staff dont have enough in their hands and heads now they have to memorise made up pronouns this will go the same route of constant persecution of sexual harassment went not real one just the witch hunt on imagined ones where a lot of men simply stopped interacting with women out of fear which then creates a huge barrier for advancement of said women this will likely mean teachersstaff even some students will just avoid speakinginteracting with those students outside of any strict requirement

nottheonion,not_removed,threaten disciplinary action if students and staff repeatedly fail to use them does this seem counterproductive to anyone else not to mention conceptually opposed to the values of which it supposedly codifies browbeating others into being accepting and compassionate is like torturing people to make them into lovers

nottheonion,not_removed,and how does one do this asking for a friend
nottheonion,not_removed,i hope youre planning on doing that somewhere outside of the us because you cant change your license just to reflect foreign titles the united states doesnt recognize them
nottheonion,not_removed,you could just flush the down the toilet and proclaim that youre baron and baroness because thats just as official as the scam youre buying into
nottheonion,not_removed,to buy official pick one
nottheonion,not_removed,you should buy a bridge or two while youre at it
nottheonion,not_removed,hopefully you dont live in the us the us doesnt recognize foreign titles
nottheonion,not_removed,thats pretty much what he his majesty trying to do
nottheonion,not_removed,the weird thing to me as a professor is that i never refer to students by pronouns to begin with like when would i pick out a specific student by saying he or she
nottheonion,not_removed,no theyll probably just limit it to actual pronouns
nottheonion,not_removed,king of bel kingofbel
nottheonion,not_removed,and thus continues the cycle of dissatisfaction

nottheonion,not_removed,in canada they are working on a federal level to make it a hate crime if you misuse pronouns to someone who wants their pronouns to be fi fo fi fu and fum i smell the blood of cis scum

nottheonion,not_removed,not a he and not a she but a stinky ze
nottheonion,not_removed,doesnt seem to matter since per the rules it allows for the arbitrary input of pronouns per the article it seems to imply that there can be punishment if the pronouns arent respected and that the individual chooses what the pronoun is whether or not its an actual word or anything of the sort so this is the rational extreme if he says its a pronoun then as far as the rules are concerned its a pronoun and if its not respected its basis for punishment of course no punishment will actually be handed down for this kind of thing except maybe to the guy in question for disrespect or some stupid shit but its an armchair protest so whatever
nottheonion,not_removed,its not a title but a httpsenmwikipediaorgwikistylemannerofaddress and in this case it can totes be used as a pronoun

nottheonion,not_removed,why would you take them seriously
nottheonion,not_removed,i actually went to school with a kid named hitler i wish i was joking he had a brother named batman and a sister named boatymcboatface
nottheonion,not_removed,i saw a kid at my brothers track meet with ymajesty
nottheonion,not_removed,im a special snowflake short and stout misuse my pronouns hear me shout
nottheonion,not_removed,a title and a pronoun are slightly different
nottheonion,not_removed,the way i see it youre either male female both or neither and im willing to call you whatever you want so long as it fits one of those four categories
nottheonion,not_removed,regressive leftists are extreme outliers thankfully hopefully this nonsense will keep it that way
nottheonion,not_removed,the left dont group us in with these fringe fanatics i think theyre ruining open discussions at college campuses and driving people to the conservative right
nottheonion,not_removed,theyre not adults just technically adults children over the age of mentally or emotionally handicapped people
nottheonion,not_removed,hes calling your name when would he use a pronoun
nottheonion,not_removed,not sure is that you
nottheonion,not_removed,which would make sense and i doubt many people would have an issue with then happens and people are justified in thinking its perhaps gone a step too far
nottheonion,not_removed,can we just accept that people who identify as gender neutral are just tumblr lesbians with a side cut
nottheonion,not_removed,compromise in the middle assbutt
nottheonion,not_removed,people people
nottheonion,not_removed,knew someone once whose middle name was dragon parents had just translated it when they moved over i was jealous
nottheonion,not_removed,my maiden name is spelled close to dragon for those who cant read or pronounce words correctly its actually an americanized version of a gaelic name i got called dragon everywhere in school restaurants doctors offices etc im so pleased to have a typical and easily recognizable last name now
nottheonion,not_removed,at my small private high school that specialized in esl highlights included seven not like seven of nine like the number lovey and banana bananas last name was wang i refuse to believe he didnt do that on purpose
nottheonion,not_removed,jackie chan
nottheonion,not_removed,dragan bender
nottheonion,not_removed,i knew a dragana
nottheonion,not_removed,i bought homemade liquor from a man named dragan in a mountain hut outside sarajevo
nottheonion,not_removed,i knew a dragan in college i think he was serbian crazy as hell and refused to graduate kept adding majors to stay in school
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,an intern at a neighbouring department is called quintessence like seriously that name was printed in huge letters on a research paper circulated to everyone
nottheonion,not_removed,dude needs to move out of my house
nottheonion,not_removed,holy shit its actually a points for attention to detail
nottheonion,not_removed,finally a microwave oven intelligent enough to attend school
nottheonion,not_removed,one for rtotallynotrobots
nottheonion,not_removed,we should be asking for the story behind it
nottheonion,not_removed,cu ft countertop microwave oven with easyclean® martha can you go to the board and solve this problem please
nottheonion,not_removed,please stop posting pictures of unrealistic body proportions not everyone can look like that notallmicrowaves
nottheonion,not_removed,would fuhrer be deemed inappropriate
nottheonion,not_removed,psssh napoleons marshal of the empire best marshal
nottheonion,not_removed,if i was going for badass military rank it would have to be supreme commander
nottheonion,not_removed,in that case i will go with sith lord
nottheonion,not_removed,itll charge your cell phone when you least suspect it
nottheonion,not_removed,well i never call my microwave i save that business for the telephone
nottheonion,not_removed,in all seriousness i believe there can be disciplinary action taken against staff
nottheonion,not_removed,you just called microwave oven a she the gender pronoun is written down man come on
nottheonion,not_removed,dont call her she havent you learnt anything from this enlightened new genderfree society edit dont call it she hoisted by my own petard
nottheonion,not_removed,wait it has age thats weird
nottheonion,not_removed,how could this ever become this big of a deal academia is fucking bizarro land thats how theyre set up to cater to early twentysomethings who dont know their ass from their elbow this is the result because the alternative is hilarious but costly lawsuits from the people youre trying to pimp your product to
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe it could be used for transgender people who identify as a new gender but havent had it changed on paper yet stuff like that
nottheonion,not_removed,everyones scared of downvotes so shit like this happens
nottheonion,not_removed,because its meant to be inclusive to people the only use for it i can see is for people that want gender neutral pronouns of course you get people taking it too far like the people on tumblr making shit up for attention then you get things like lg dude taking the piss out of it
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah in the uk you sometimes see a rather long pulldown list i found it hilarious the first time i saw it baron count viscount lord earl duke reverend right reverend admiral etc at least they didnt assume the queen or the pope might be ordering from them mind you i had an aunt who was a the honorable when i was little i always wondered why she was called the hon she was nice but that seemed a bit much
nottheonion,not_removed,some names are gender neutral kelly casie jamie jessie for example also some names are uncommon and so an implied gender may not be obvious
nottheonion,not_removed,i work for a travel company and some of our cruise clients have posh titles such as rear admiral and duchess etc they get very pissed if thats not on their paperwork
nottheonion,not_removed,cant speak for the us but here in germany dr as in phd is an official part of your name
nottheonion,not_removed,bro when you get a title you flaunt that shit dr professor esquire lord john von tallywack iii
nottheonion,not_removed,in retrospect im not entirely sure maybe it was in the design spec well the loosely agreed upon one that we had that people have a title i cant remember it kind of made sense in a form oriented business a generated report might email the boss and theres a greeting in the top of the email and it might say something like mr soandso heres this months report but instead it ended up saying lord soandso heres this months report
nottheonion,not_removed,in a way it is given the umich acceptance rate
nottheonion,not_removed,the state of michigan has great city names in general bad axe iron mountain rattle rungaylord

nottheonion,not_removed,you need a comma in there dog
nottheonion,not_removed,dont forget the double dash to instruct the database the ignore the rest of the statement and not throw a syntax error
nottheonion,not_removed,came in here expecting to see bobby tables and i did
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah if you pick the right title its always funny just disappointed that he gave up on me i wanted the full mickey mouse treatment and for it to last all year
nottheonion,not_removed,is it too late to change my superhero name

nottheonion,not_removed,woah there trump
nottheonion,not_removed,are you implying the moon rock i purchased from the back of that vw van at the gas station doesnt entitle me to put lord of the moon on my business card
nottheonion,not_removed,yea that kind of land severance is unlikely to be approved by the local government
nottheonion,not_removed,is the sealand nobility stuff legit since the government of sealand sells it
nottheonion,not_removed,of course it is youre fucking high if you think actual lords wouldve made it that easy to join their ranks
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe its like those companies that sell deeds to land on the moon or titles of nobility from sealand here buy this certificate and you totally legally own some land in scotland where is this land doesnt matter youre a laird now
nottheonion,not_removed,its fun to pretend
nottheonion,not_removed,laphroaig gives like a square inch of land per bottle right so hes drank bottles of that scotchi like the dedication
nottheonion,not_removed,all you have to do is fall for a scam
nottheonion,not_removed,this is completely false lairds are nobility and their title is awarded by the crown
nottheonion,not_removed,buy a bottle of laphraoig scotch whiskey and send in your claim then enjoy some kickass liquor
nottheonion,not_removed,i dunno man maybe we should eat another and hours later uatheist and usaucehankredemption were passed out on the shag carpet
nottheonion,not_removed,verily
nottheonion,not_removed,so youre the fucker that made my daughter cry
nottheonion,not_removed,because rodney dangerfield blitheringtonsmythe the fourth gets called rod by everyone
nottheonion,not_removed,rcirclebroke im not entirely sure here is an
nottheonion,not_removed,ive literally been scanning through the comments trying to figure out what the hell cb is
nottheonion,not_removed,circlebroke is srs with less still heavy moderation and longer comments that express the same political opinion they still believe everything srs believes they just dont spam the comments section in their threads with dildz kill all men xd
nottheonion,not_removed,my guess is rcirclebroke
nottheonion,not_removed,best i can tell from the other comments cb means which appears to be srssarcasm im having a hard time telling which side of the lunatic bin theyre from
nottheonion,not_removed,the admins run srs so no they did not ban themselves intortus is still a mod and if you check youll see that her account used to be an admin she no longer works at reddit but continues to run srs the other admins use other accounts
nottheonion,not_removed,the admins love srs so that cesspool is an exception to every rule
nottheonion,not_removed,its always the people that are against harassment that do it the most isnt it fuck it whatever ill be in tia kia and gtav if you need me
nottheonion,not_removed,rshitredditsays they link hateful bigots and perfectly reasonable people those usually without context or harmless jokes and then do some mostly poor cringy trolling they love to whine about the plights of le reactionaries™ white cis men™ nazi dogwhistles™ misogyny islamophobia™ racism fat phobia™ transmisogyny™ etc etc they also love to apply feminist history and biology to any social issues they discuss
nottheonion,not_removed,a place for butthurt socially maladjusted i identifying as a toaster oven types
nottheonion,not_removed,for a good portion of them its mental illness
nottheonion,not_removed,and here i am that dude who keeps clapping after everyones done
nottheonion,not_removed,it is if youre boy george
nottheonion,not_removed,you could become one from httpwwwsealandgovorgtitlepacklordladybaronbaroness for much less than its pretty legit
nottheonion,not_removed,cant wait for people to follow suit lord commander john squibbles her majesty dorothy parton my main man david tonson the student formerly known as felix hughes his holyness trayvon ducraine grand inquisitor tabitha stark im not putting a pronoun infront of my name gregory thomas patron saint carl phendenberg royal advisor jamie fuk
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah i always refer to people by their names makes more sense than pointing and yelling a random pronoun at someone
nottheonion,not_removed,and what discriminate against people like me im a ferrofluid bipolar scientist so stop oppressing me ok
nottheonion,not_removed,so just shit like aer xir faer xi zer mer zhe or actual english he she they it
nottheonion,not_removed,stop talking about my relationships
nottheonion,not_removed,not sure if sarcastic joke or terrible kin poetry
nottheonion,not_removed,that is full retarded hope it doesnt pass
nottheonion,not_removed,as someone that goes to umich you crybaby nottheonion shitheads can honestly hop off a fucking cliff feel free to downvote it doesnt actually do anything the admins are a lot smarter than you are and im gonna sticky this post so your downvotes are gonna do fuck all yep it is up there for sure
nottheonion,not_removed,oh that sub is a shining example of reddit cancer nothing good comes feom that sub except the entire worlds salt supply
nottheonion,not_removed,im not usually a fan of heavy salt but these tears are delicious
nottheonion,not_removed,you can feel the trigger through the internet
nottheonion,not_removed,continues to deny that theyre salty as fuck
nottheonion,not_removed,theyre overtly trying so hard to distance themselves from reddit that ironically they created their own circlejerk of pure distilled smugness
nottheonion,not_removed,what the fuck is this what the fuck i thought normal reddit made me angry
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe his majesty is royaltykin ever consider that shitlord s e in reply to uunonymousununoctium
nottheonion,not_removed,helpmeat judy ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
nottheonion,not_removed,why the r then
nottheonion,not_removed,it comes from mistress youre right but because the pronunciation has changed it cant really be written out that way anymore
nottheonion,not_removed,no i have to say youre wrong in that people think that custompronouns are stupid
nottheonion,not_removed,when i was a little kid sometimes people would mistake me for a girl over the phone it was kinda embarrassing but i was able to laugh about it also shit happens i dealt with it
nottheonion,not_removed,boatymcboatface proof or it didnt happen
nottheonion,not_removed,their father albert einstein
nottheonion,not_removed,i didnt know hitler and boatymcboatface were orphans too
nottheonion,not_removed,its technically a style and can be used as a pronoun eg instead of hes away youd say his majesty is away but can you imagine how obnoxious itd be if a saudi prince actually insisted on using that in everyday conversation
nottheonion,not_removed,how about this one that one the other one we have no need to gender it in the first place if we dont need to but people need fucking ze and that other shit
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah well zir and xim arent pronouns so thats not how that works either
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah that seems a bit excessive after a certain point you just need to make things simple i know some cultures have more than i dont see excess of maybe as being necessary
nottheonion,not_removed,or frecklecheddar
nottheonion,not_removed,diamond stone and dragan bender in the same draft class these are some goat names
nottheonion,not_removed,does the na make the name feminine in serbian or is that also a masculine name
nottheonion,not_removed,i know a draco from somewhere
nottheonion,not_removed,now that sounds like a story that goes somewhere
nottheonion,not_removed,everytime i see this picture i find it weird that they wrote btmn bin suferman in arabic

nottheonion,not_removed,diddid you take that picture with your laptop
nottheonion,not_removed,which bathroom does microwave use
nottheonion,not_removed,not only is it real thats my exact microwave
nottheonion,not_removed,pfff lg microwave oven only got there because of affirmative assembly
nottheonion,not_removed,but can you be the digger nick
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe but dear leader normally goes well
nottheonion,not_removed,i would just go for master as it seems a bit more topical in the us
nottheonion,not_removed,rempiredidnothingwrong
nottheonion,not_removed,man when i found out that fact it blew my mind being able to charge your phone that fast is a real lpt
nottheonion,not_removed,this is so fucking ridiculous he she and they are all the pronouns we need if a teacher makes a mistake and calls someone he whos really a she that just looks very similar to a male then thats a mistake if a teacher is clearly deliberately doing that repeatedly then disciplinary action is probably justified then because its clearly deliberate disrespect and bullying but short of thatno thats fucking silly custom pronouns are fucking silly
nottheonion,not_removed,did you just abbreviate lg microwave ovens pronoun
nottheonion,not_removed,amusingly your comment got linked on srs
nottheonion,not_removed,it the fuck man why you gotta be so insensitive if lg microwave oven were here lg microwave ovend be in tears you ass
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah especially when the professor literally only needs your name and email to do his job most of the time not even the email
nottheonion,not_removed,it went way too fucking far so long ago that while probably of people realize this cluster fuck is ridiculous there exists who would raise such a ruckus if one of the spoke out that jobsreputationslives are at risk
nottheonion,not_removed,good luck referring to that student microwave for short
nottheonion,not_removed,i had to look up right reverend thats hilariously british apparently other types of clergy can be the very reverend and archbishops are the most reverend
nottheonion,not_removed,baron count viscount there are no counts in the british peerage that position is taken by earl instead we do have viscounts though
nottheonion,not_removed,queen of the andals the rhoynar and the first men lady regnant of the seven kingdoms protector of the realm khaleesi of the great grass sea breaker of chains and mother of dragons

nottheonion,not_removed,people who dont know what sudo does are downvoting you
nottheonion,not_removed,why would he need a comma to drop a statement dog
nottheonion,not_removed,fixed
nottheonion,not_removed,i would have man if i became a teacher id do shit like that all the time id probably also get written up for swearing
nottheonion,not_removed,well they also have superhero knees you dont see normal people doing that shit
nottheonion,not_removed,is that sexual harassment
nottheonion,not_removed,the pole just got ten feet higher
nottheonion,not_removed,for anyone wondering trump was told by the city hall to take down or lower his american flag pole but he refused and was charged like a fine every day he negotiated a deal to lower his flag to pole and hed donate the entire fined amount like to charity he took down the flag then built a hill and installed the new legal flag pole
nottheonion,not_removed,you do whatever it is that makes you happy my lord
nottheonion,not_removed,they might do it just as a stupid gimmick for a local company they like there have been stupider things that have happened in local government
nottheonion,not_removed,not really nobody recognizes sealand so nobody recognizes their titles then againi dont think any titles actually matter anymore so im not sure youll see much difference between sealand nobility and nobility of a real country
nottheonion,not_removed,i think that in some cases the title may be legitimate but only really in the country of origin ie im sure that anyone in sealand can use the titles and print whatever they like when they are there but any other country wont really recognise it but may go along with it depending on the title ie not sir dame his majesty etc that aside youd be banking on other countries recognizing sealand as a country in its own right as well
nottheonion,not_removed,what so owning a small square of unproductive moorland that couldnt even produce one small potato a year isnt enough to become a member of the aristocracy those fucking tight arses
nottheonion,not_removed,square foot as far as i know you can only get the one and theyll even show you where it is and give you everything you need to go measure it if you visit the distillery
nottheonion,not_removed,what does this mean ive literally thrown away potential claims on scottish real estate
nottheonion,not_removed,thou art not op take thy scurrilous falsehoods and be gone post haste ruffian
nottheonion,not_removed,i apologize a trillion times
nottheonion,not_removed,rcirclebroke its one of the many antechambers used by the srs cabal edit anti ante
nottheonion,not_removed,if it has much more discussion much less moderation and no brigading then its not really srs at all is it as far as i can tell cb is mainly discussion about annoying reddit things while srs is mainly haranguing redditors for whatever they deem offensive that seems pretty different
nottheonion,not_removed,why would they even work on reddit if they hate it so much
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,sealand nobility is exactly the opposite of legit because sealand is completely unrecognized by any actually legit nations edit to paste the relevant quote from httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprincipalityofsealand while it has been described as the worlds smallest country or nation sealand is not officially recognised by any established sovereign state in spite of sealands governments claim that it has been de facto recognised by the united kingdom and germany the united nations convention on the law of the sea in force since states artificial islands installations and structures do not possess the status of islands they have no territorial sea of their own and their presence does not affect the delimitation of the territorial sea the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf sealand was not grandfathered and sits in british waters
nottheonion,not_removed,excuse me my pronoun is first of his name king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm

nottheonion,not_removed,ferrofluids use they pronouns you fraud
nottheonion,not_removed,well keep it short
nottheonion,not_removed,there is a bill to make it part of the charter canadian equivalent to the bill of right to make it illegal to discriminate against anyones preferred expression of gender what this means in practice is anyones guess until it gets in front of a judge could it mean that you are required to use someones made up pronouns maybe
nottheonion,not_removed,hahahaha some fuck thinks sweden would back them up on this
nottheonion,not_removed,literally how circlebroke describes itself
nottheonion,not_removed,funny because one of the defining characteristics of reddit is a smug sense of superiority over something else theyre more reddit than the people they mock
nottheonion,not_removed,thats what always amused me about these subs they keep trying to convince themselves that theyre not a part of reddit its pretty sad to watch
nottheonion,not_removed,duh a story is only funny to us cis white males because its oppressing others
nottheonion,not_removed,excuse me but i identify as crownkin and do not appreciate my implied objectification in all of this
nottheonion,not_removed,slight inebriation
nottheonion,not_removed,missers missuers
nottheonion,not_removed,and when i was a little girl people would sometimes mistake me for a boy honestly thats just because voices sound the same when youre so young
nottheonion,not_removed,are any of them really necessary if you werent raised being told that gender presentation is socially important would you care earnest question i just really dont understand why nonlgbtq people seem to be so defensive of gender and gender roles

nottheonion,not_removed,uconn had a commitment from diamond stone if i remember correctly he would have been playing with prince ali and turtle jackson being a uconn fan the decommits made me sad
nottheonion,not_removed,not na just a so you have dragana zorana jovana milana etc of course not every name follows that same pattern andrija our version of andrew or kosta are all masculine names it seem that if a masculine name ends with an n add an a and youll get a feminine name
nottheonion,not_removed,magic school

nottheonion,not_removed,dude the lg microwave oven is not the issue
nottheonion,not_removed,is there any other way to take a picture
nottheonion,not_removed,be glad he wore clothes while taking it
nottheonion,not_removed,when taking on the identity of a microwave oven go big or go home i often say
nottheonion,not_removed,you should do an ama
nottheonion,not_removed,you monster how dare you enslave that brave and stunning marginalised person
nottheonion,not_removed,hey we have enslaved and abused machines for hundreds of years they deserve a little extra consideration and a little help overcoming the obvious antiai bias in the education system

nottheonion,not_removed,ah ok thanks its hard for an american to keep track the only current titles in my family are captain doctor and professorprofessor emeritus
nottheonion,not_removed,he was saying that the chosen title will imply gender if someone has the name kelly smith you wont necessarily know if they are a man or woman or which they identify as but if they add the title mr kelly smith chances are this individual would like to be referred to as a he
nottheonion,not_removed,i think its for a case where you might need to call them and its polite to say mrmsmrs l when you talk to someone on the phone edit just thought of mail headers too polite and official
nottheonion,not_removed,marketing purposes business correspondence medical etc

nottheonion,not_removed,lord tight arse to you peasant
nottheonion,not_removed,well mmm still doesnt make up for the fact shes thirteen
nottheonion,not_removed,antechamber though i suppose anti would work in various contexts too
nottheonion,not_removed,because reddit is in the end a media tool maintained by various cliques
nottheonion,not_removed,because its what these people do they infiltrate communities in order to take over them and then impose their politics
nottheonion,not_removed,chris evans finest role was in that movie
nottheonion,not_removed,weird all i see is
nottheonion,not_removed,reddit censors your password if you try and say it see btw ill trim your armor for

nottheonion,not_removed,for some reason when the normans conquered england they didnt change the terminology for that rank from the anglosaxon scandinavian earljarl to the latin rank comes its one of the few bits of anglosaxon to survive in the elite vocabulary typically we have two sets of words for many things in english because the elite households would use the latinfrench terms and the farmerspeasants would use the older language but in this particular case the old term hung on viscount was introduced later so it conformed to the later rules giving us the odd situation of having viscounts without counts

nottheonion,not_removed,he also didnt donate to charity he asked people to donate to his charity and then used those donations to settle his personal fine while i understand the importance of local building codes and understand trumps opinion that a usa flag is important the last part of using a charity to pay fines is completely awful

nottheonion,not_removed,til i love etymology you can learn so much more than you expect from it name origins are very cool as well my american mother was huge on geneaology which has left me with something of an interest as well ive been trying to find out more about my husbands family origins lately just out of sheer curiosity i can trace my fathers ancestry back from virginia to england to primarily welsh sources including a welldocumented descent though not directly through the paternal line from davy gam so it seems odd to me to know nothing about where my husbands family may have made their home over the years its actually rather odd until my generation my dads family seems to have pretty much picked a place and stuck there like glue for hundreds of years at a time which made them very easy to trace most of my relatives on his side still live in virginia and have since they arrived in the early while my mil is welsh and both her parents were joneses one of whom was adopted making it essentially impossible to get much further his fathers surname may come from either of two different sources an anglosaxon topographical name or an occupational surname from middle english unfortunately his dads siblings seem to have no clue about anything before their grandparents but similarity of spelling and geographical proximity seems to point to the former which is at least a clue considering that literally everyone on my dads side of the family as far back as anyone can remember has incredibly poor sight it seems likely to me that the name gam came from a squint rather than a game leg though of course theres no nonanecdotal evidence for either either way quite an interesting guy to have in the ancestry sorry to go so far off topic i just enjoy researching random things and then theres no one to talk to them about

nottheonion,not_removed,the cafe was screening englishlanguage episodes of an american animated adult sciencefiction comedy called rick and morty i cant imagine what else theyd be watching when sausagewielding extremists started the offensive
nottheonion,not_removed,i like how the article has already called out the inevitable internet reaction to this story taken out of the context of recent events in tbilisi the incident could be dismissed by some as part of a backlash that has emerged on social media recently against anticarnivorous vegan rhetoric in western counterculture that reaction is illustrated by a trending youtube clip called if meat eaters acted like vegans
nottheonion,not_removed,those fucking monsters broke up a screening of rick and morty
nottheonion,not_removed,thats just rude
nottheonion,not_removed,i wish all extremists were only sausage wielding ones
nottheonion,not_removed,how do you know someone eats meat dont worry theyll throw it at you
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,it really is the end times when you start being protested for eating your vegetables
nottheonion,not_removed,i eat meat but the people complaining about vegans fatigue me far more than vegans themselves i mean there are far more carnivores and the numbers are definitely in their favor meat isnt going anywhere and its sold everywhere even in cities like portland and sf you still have to go out of your way to find a fully vegan restaurant and youre always wondering if theyre going to stay in business theyre as unthreatening as a specialty bookstore
nottheonion,not_removed,so apparently the sausagewielding extremists have ties to neonazis the irony
nottheonion,not_removed,georgian here these are bunch of total idiots they are considered idiots here in country and are total idiots by scientific observation and that is proven fact please do not judge country by bunch of idiots
nottheonion,not_removed,i laughed at first mostly because i pictured men dancing around with sausages flopping around in each hand but then i got really pissed off and its not as if it being the regular hatred of vegans wouldve made it okay being harassed and assaulted is never okay
nottheonion,not_removed,what the fuck
nottheonion,not_removed,if i take the time out of my day to enjoy a meal at my favorite cafe and some bozo comes up and starts messing with my food best believe were gonna be fighting thats just common sense dont mess with my food
nottheonion,not_removed,who here read the whole article seems to me it was an attack on foreigners lesbians bis and gays as well as vegans the cafe was just a popular hangout for these groups also the cafe called the attackers neo nazis who were previously chanting soviet union reteric its more than just an attack on people who eat only veggies by maniacle sausage lovers it was some lunatics telling non georgians and people who dont follow georgian ideals to gtfo
nottheonion,not_removed,there needs to be retaliation everyone grab your broccoli sticks and lets lock and load
nottheonion,not_removed,ugh extremists are the wurst
nottheonion,not_removed,this is the wurst story ive ever heard ill show myself out
nottheonion,not_removed,damn you sausage boys
nottheonion,not_removed,why not live and let live
nottheonion,not_removed,that headline takes away from the seriousness of the situation
nottheonion,not_removed,when i read the title i imagined a dude walking into a crowd of vegans and opening up a trenchcoat to reveal packs of hotdogs strapped to his chest
nottheonion,not_removed,oh but when i walk by am elementary school holding my sausage i have to register as a sex offender
nottheonion,not_removed,rednecks are a global phenomenon theys eatin diffrent food than us geeit em
nottheonion,not_removed,whos shoving a lifestyle in whose face
nottheonion,not_removed,the attackers fled before police arrived and no arrests were made police briefly detained some cafe staff members for interrogation sounds like the police in my town
nottheonion,not_removed,thats just mean ruining someones food should be a felony
nottheonion,not_removed,considering the violence these peopled exhibited i am not at all surprised that they are also seemingly homophobic
nottheonion,not_removed,i will eat nothing animal for a day in honor of these poor vegans
nottheonion,not_removed,good old fashioned georgia sausage party
nottheonion,not_removed,this is it the moment i would travel back to see if i got one timetravel coupon this must have been hilarious and not taking sides either just on its face its fucking funny a bunch of thugs run up to a restaurant wielding sausages and they assault the patrons with sausage and a sausage fight breaks out its fucking monty python come to life
nottheonion,not_removed,at least the extremists had meats instead of
nottheonion,not_removed,allahu snackbar throws sausage
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont get all the hate towards vegans i mean the jokes are hilarious especially but honestly ive never met an annoying vegan the only time it ever comes up is when my friends politely ask for something else to eat which always happens at public functions ive never had some guests come over to my house after i cooked a bunch of food and had someone turn all of them down because they were vegan demanding that i made something else for them
nottheonion,not_removed,there is a tbilisi georgia in the us they may have a vega cafe
nottheonion,not_removed,i love how the very existence of vegans is enough to send a lot of meat eaters into a rage speaks volumes about them
nottheonion,not_removed,lol attacking people who dont want to hurt anything makes sense
nottheonion,not_removed,cant believe this made it to the front page its my friends cafe in tbilisi
nottheonion,not_removed,first they ignore you then they ridicule you then they fight you and then you win ― mahatma gandhi
nottheonion,not_removed,why do so many people on the interwebs hate vegans
nottheonion,not_removed,beyond the statements of the cafe proprietors do we we know if this was indeed a politically motivated neofascist sausage attack are cased meat products traditionally associated with hate groups there
nottheonion,not_removed,one of the most oniony titles i have read on this sub ever
nottheonion,not_removed,disappointed i had the wrong idea of sausagewielding
nottheonion,not_removed,you have to be an extremist to waste a perfectly good sausage or a piece of meat an extreme idiot that is you cook and eat that shit
nottheonion,not_removed,the wurst kind of criminals
nottheonion,not_removed,the wurst criminals
nottheonion,not_removed,the premeditated meat assault against the vegan cafe this would be quite humorous in portland or but under the circumstances in georgia it is disturbing
nottheonion,not_removed,relevant
nottheonion,not_removed,meat tossers
nottheonion,not_removed,pretty cool looking place how dare they interrupt a showing of rick and morty saracen dogs
nottheonion,not_removed,thats a bit extreme i would understand if hammer wielding carpentry enthusiasts attacks them but sausage thats just too much
nottheonion,not_removed,relevant
nottheonion,not_removed,gentlemen welcome to tiblisi
nottheonion,not_removed,is it actually run by kiwis
nottheonion,not_removed,oh come on that was way more than pounds
nottheonion,not_removed,of all the thing to be an extremist about
nottheonion,not_removed,can anyone tell me now to pronounce the name of this country
nottheonion,not_removed,i read sausage wielding feminists attack vegan resteraunt mine was funnier
nottheonion,not_removed,didnt dale gribble try something like this
nottheonion,not_removed,is it bad that i imagine this as the meat throwing scene from the movie pcu link for the lazy
nottheonion,not_removed,i knew it would be a sausage fest but waving your own sausage around in public isnt that exposing yourself in public
nottheonion,not_removed,what a waste of meat
nottheonion,not_removed,i honestly wish i could be witness to something like this it sounds like the fight of the century and its funny as all hell worldstar
nottheonion,not_removed,as a meat eater i always strongly encourage others to be vegetarians it is not environmentally viable to have everyone eat a lot of meat i figure i will eat the meat and encourage several others not to
nottheonion,not_removed,did rick and morty break the fourth wall
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,wow they had so much time on their hands they decided to take their sausages to a vegan cafe
nottheonion,not_removed,theres tons of bad and sad actions happens in tbilisi but somehow vegan cafe is more important very interesting right now all say wtf and thats cuz there was some english speaking guy working there but if there were not any this would be country side problem only like any other is yay everyone should do as they wish but you guus only are interested in if something is related to european culture or something thats out of border well if there was something that only realted to georgia im pretty sure noone would give a shit yet i dont really like what happened
nottheonion,not_removed,after reading this im not so sure if it was a hate thing against vegans even though meat was thrown at them yes but seems more like a community against people starting a business in the citycountytownwhatever and not involving the people themselves idk hard to judge considering the news tells you things from one side
nottheonion,not_removed,thats gotta be a porno sausage wielding extremist meets lemon stealing whore
nottheonion,not_removed,viva la risistance
nottheonion,not_removed,please tell me they used the sausages like meat nunchucks
nottheonion,not_removed,ive definitely never ever heard the phrase sausage wielding extremists in my life before
nottheonion,not_removed,let the vegan war begin
nottheonion,not_removed,called the attackers neonazis even though hitler was vegetarian im confused
nottheonion,not_removed,i want more detailed descriptions of the weapons were they breakfast sausage brats kielbasa chorizo jimmy deans italian sweet andor hot were they cooked or raw grilled steamed fried boiled butterflied i wanna know god dammit
nottheonion,not_removed,sounds more like radio yerevan
nottheonion,not_removed,i never once heard a vegan bitch about meat eaters but i hear plenty of meat eaters bitch about vegans
nottheonion,not_removed,not going to even lie but my initial thought was damn isis sure seem to be losing it thisis new
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont think thats cool but i wanted a video so badly
nottheonion,not_removed,really we have people who are so worried about what other people are doing that they violate vegan meals too many people who are far too stupid think they know far too much about how to run others lives
nottheonion,not_removed,i wasnt really invested one way or the other until i saw that they interrupted a rick and morty screening fuck those guys
nottheonion,not_removed,about time seen tons of videos where vegans come in to ruin peoples meals because they made a healthier life choice by eating meat then in the vegan delusion act like they did people a favor as if they didnt just scream at people over a megaphone insulting peoples own choices while they crowd the place with self serving propaganda to people who are just trying to enjoy their food
nottheonion,not_removed,the title itself made me laugh i imagined a mild disturbance like people throwing sausages at the window then i read the article and the sausage throwers are a bunch of dicks
nottheonion,not_removed,you had me at sausagewielding extremists
nottheonion,not_removed,apparently rick and morty is vegan rhetoric
nottheonion,not_removed,this is the kind of extremism and terrorism i can read about without clenching my butt in fear for the world id take a sausage attack any day
nottheonion,not_removed,is the cafes mascot a kiwi on a bike edit blah its called kiwi cafe
nottheonion,not_removed,in this thread worstwurst puns that ramsay bolton gif strangely vitriolic antivegan rhetoric praising these men as heroes references to a year old movie that depicts college life as a series of hackneyed cliches sinister aristocratic frat boys dreadlocked hippies in tie dyed shirts manhating militant feminists funhating stickinthemud college administrators etc
nottheonion,not_removed,they interrupted a screening of rick and morty thats low
nottheonion,not_removed,lol its the non vegan equivalent of but im a vegan
nottheonion,not_removed,damn now i cant say you dont see nonvegans telling you how to eat when a vegan tells me how to eat
nottheonion,not_removed,bunch of redditors finally went insane
nottheonion,not_removed,classic meateaters always shoving it in vegans faces
nottheonion,not_removed,welcome to the first world georgia
nottheonion,not_removed,the headline is great and i was laughing until i got to the part about neonazis hating on lgbts etc thats not cool
nottheonion,not_removed,this is awesome given how preachy and intolerant vegans are they definitely deserve stuff like this to happen to them
nottheonion,not_removed,us vs them over and over and over again
nottheonion,not_removed,im guessing someone tried to rhyme kielbasa and tbilisi i think i just tried im fucking pissed off
nottheonion,not_removed,they should arm themselves i was trying to think of the best veggie or plant weapons they could hit them bk with
nottheonion,not_removed,ah gotta love rick and morty and a hot steamy sasauge slapped against your face
nottheonion,not_removed,first they came for the portobello reuben and i said nothing then they came for rick and morty and who was left to speak for me
nottheonion,not_removed,disney predicted this years ago edit start at httpsyoutubennbadjqnxk
nottheonion,not_removed,this is literally the reversal of a monty python sketch how to attack people with fresh fruit
nottheonion,not_removed,murica
nottheonion,not_removed,i had to read the title three times then forgot to check if it was rsubredditsimulator
nottheonion,not_removed,there is no f or w in the georgian alphabet so how do you write kiwi cafe
nottheonion,not_removed,taliban
nottheonion,not_removed,that will show them
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,who else immediately thought of the finger print robber from gumball when they saw sausage wielding extremists
nottheonion,not_removed,httpmimgurcomgalleryuacuryh
nottheonion,not_removed,something tells me rick sanchez would have wanted it that way i wish i could have seen that surreal scene
nottheonion,not_removed,my grandmother is georgian and takes a lot of pride in the accomplishments of total strangers just because she has this weird national pride i should show her this
nottheonion,not_removed,honestly the only place ive seen meat eaters and vagans arguing is on the internet and even then its pretty rare for me to see not to say that it doesnt go on outise the internet i just dont see or hear about it that much maybe its just my area i only know a few vegans in my area
nottheonion,not_removed,i read this as extremists attack vegan cafe with tbills and was thoroughly confused
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,i just cant wrap my head around the idea of trying to change people views vegans lgbt or race i really dont give a fuck what theyre doing in their life just mind your own goddamn business why be such a lil shit and disturb others for petty matters
nottheonion,not_removed,ive been waiting for this headline my entire life this is amazing
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,this is it
nottheonion,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikitbilisi
nottheonion,not_removed,all i think about when reading headline is pcu
nottheonion,not_removed,new zealand retaliates with with kumaras
nottheonion,not_removed,papa franku taught them too well
nottheonion,not_removed,so this is where anthony weiner and huma andouille have been
nottheonion,not_removed,i give you a hamburger
nottheonion,not_removed,oh cmon we were just having some fun under breaththrowing some meat name that movie
nottheonion,not_removed,it soundsmore like one of the anarchist cafes who attack people for being against terrorism
nottheonion,not_removed,no matter how random something is in fiction theres something happening in reality that is so much better
nottheonion,not_removed,the world is stacked against vegans nobody is ever taught how to defend themselves about lunatics with sausages or pointed sticks but ive been taught self defence against vegans with every kind of fresh fruit on earth
nottheonion,not_removed,so are they protesting fruits or foreigners i dont get it either way
nottheonion,not_removed,alright then
nottheonion,not_removed,what a time to be alive
nottheonion,not_removed,if youre going to be extremists at least be fun too i want to be attacked by pizza wielding extremists
nottheonion,not_removed,theres a second side to the story also take a look
nottheonion,not_removed,of the attack
nottheonion,not_removed,this does not seem like an appropriate use of someones time and energy
nottheonion,not_removed,the irony in this thread is actually kinda sad
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,came for a video was slightly disappointed
nottheonion,not_removed,that place sounds like reddit incarnated
nottheonion,not_removed,i love how vegans are now calling meat eating a facist ideal i dont care if you dont eat meat or not i personally think it is a stupid decision but i can live with those that do it but for the love of god stop being so pretentious about it those people those i would gladly take up a sausage against
nottheonion,not_removed,is this what martin luther king died for
nottheonion,not_removed,not one lewd joke about sausagewielding extremists not one reddit i am disappoint
nottheonion,not_removed,i find it funny they said the extremists where nazis but hitler was a vegetarian
nottheonion,not_removed,im such a fucking cynic at this point that the first thought i had was they staged this themselves
nottheonion,not_removed,a statement issued on may through kiwi cafes facebook page described the incident as an antivegan provocative action and called the attackers neonazis who support fascist ideas lol when they find out hitler was a vegetarian
nottheonion,not_removed,best story in ages damn hipsters eat a cheeseburger
nottheonion,not_removed,i have a buddy that wherever someone says either the word hot dog or sausage repeats the word loudly in a stereotypically homosexual voice
nottheonion,not_removed,thats the wurst story
nottheonion,not_removed,if someone attacked me with sausages while i was watching rick and morty itd be a little surreal especially if it was in one of the allpossibleuniverses type episodes
nottheonion,not_removed,i really enjoy how the described it as an englishlanguage film screening that makes rm sound so fancy
nottheonion,not_removed,real life interdimensional cable
nottheonion,not_removed,screening probably illegally downloaded episodes with subs
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess theyve got beef
nottheonion,not_removed,big deal my plumbus could stop crimes this harsh
nottheonion,not_removed,dont you see this is just what we need in our fight against isis
nottheonion,not_removed,so but with sausages
nottheonion,not_removed,sausagewielding extremists this phrase has a potential lets try it typical chauvinist swe action he immediately started to wield sausage on me scales of extremism pacificist right farright extreme right sausagewielding do not sausagewield me sausagehandling
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought that was pretty interesting though usually the journalist will present a single interpretation of an event but in this case i like that they presented it from more than one perspective i dont know the circumstances so describing the content in greater detail better informs me to the extent i believe anything i read
nottheonion,not_removed,the interesting thing about that video is that the guy in them is actually a very granola hippie dude thats just trying to help his own crowd be more selfaware if people watch the rest of his stuff hes really warm and the kind of vegan people like
nottheonion,not_removed,so theyre blaming the meat eater reaction on vegan rhetoric
nottheonion,not_removed,the guy who made that video is a vegan himself btw
nottheonion,not_removed,i was laughing till they mentioned that the side that interrupted rick and morty was clearly in the wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,the only appropriate response
nottheonion,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡° oh hi uwormri funny to see you comment outside of rbigdickseveryday talking about the terrorist fantasy again huh
nottheonion,not_removed,you laugh but i literally had a coworker throw chicken fat in my mouth because he thought being vegetarian was stupid
nottheonion,not_removed,i was vegetarian as a kid and other kids would throw meat at me i tend to just tell certain people that im not hungry when they offer me meat because i would rather not incite their rage
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,its sad how much meat eaters and society actually shove it in vegans faces and how little vegans actually tell you people are such jerks when it comes to anyone doing something different
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,gotta paint it black and put trijicon sights with a round mag for it to be assault sausage
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,people complain about vegans and vegetarians bringing it up a lot but one of our societies main social activities is sharing a meal together the only time i really hear vegetarians and vegans brining up their diet is if im like oh hey you should come over for dinner some time and they respond with ok cool i have x dietary concern its the same with people who are celiacs or keep kosher or are allergic to something if you have a niche diet its gonna come up in the context of food selection during group activities its not a big deal and i feel like some people interpret it as being preachy when its really just a neutral fact statement and it makes perfect sense that theyd bring it up because thats important relevant information ive helped prepare meals with my friends who are vegans its not a big deal meat was served for those who wanted it nobodys preachy about it and theyre always happy you made the effort to accommodate their needs
nottheonion,not_removed,in this case the people who were attacking the vegan cafe were right wing extremists who had been asking if a lot of lgbt people were using the cafe so i think it goes a little deeper than the normal disagreements between vegetarians and meat eaters
nottheonion,not_removed,how can you tell if somebodys vegan dont worry everyone else around them will be trying to start a debate with them over it
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont want to add to all the metacomplaining god people complainingx about vegans are way worse than people about vegans but when i was a vegan i never talked about it unless it was brought up and when it was there was always one person who would fall over themselves to complain about me hey can we order one of those sandwiches without ham why are you a vegetarian vegan actually yeah dont you know that satan and hitler were vegetarians and jesus christ died choking on celery and red bell peppers caused the housing crisis nowadays i just pretend i dont like meat it saves time and stress
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks i would love it if we could just drop the whole giving a shit about everyone else diet thing
nottheonion,not_removed,ive noticed too the people constantly attacking vegans are a lot less cool than your average vegan
nottheonion,not_removed,i feel like something similar is kind of going on with the political correctness issue the people who are bitching about how sensitive other people are often seem overly sensitive themselves
nottheonion,not_removed,seriously is there some goddamned conspiracy i dont know about am i going to attempt to bite into my hamburger and find out its tofu no then who the fuck cares already
nottheonion,not_removed,im happily carnivorous now but i was a vegetarian for years and a vegan for a chunk of that time i had way more shit from meat eaters than i ever gave and now as a meat eater i can see the same things from this side no vegetarian or vegan ive ever met has been a douchebag about what they eat
nottheonion,not_removed,right my wife and i went vegan for a good five years and most our friends are vegan everytime we went out with other friends or to a social event inevitably it would be brought up when we ordered nonmeat alternatives or turned down offered meat then the jokes would start how do you know a vegan dont worry theyll tell you motherfucker you brought it up yeah well you kill plants oh man look at this juicy steak dont you want some of it just smell it if i give you fifty bucks will you eat this thats funny you dont look like a vegan
nottheonion,not_removed,i cant remember the last time ive heard an aggressive vegan but i see circlejerk posts a day complaining about vegans just shut up
nottheonion,not_removed,glasgow is great for vegans certainly wont be going anywhere voted the most veganfriendly city in the uk
nottheonion,not_removed,it reminds me of when fox beats the christianity is under attack drum every fucking holiday season just because some people try to be inclusive by saying happy holidays
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,theres an all vegan bar in portland called sweet hereafter that has great food i say this as a carnivore who looks at pet pigs on a leash walking around the city with murderous eyes salivating profusely something about tofu lightly fried in nutritional yeast thats sexual
nottheonion,not_removed,i was usually the only meat eater in my circle of friends in college never once did anyone say anything id be chewing at a chicken and her scrambled young while they ate a salad and wed just not even notice hell i even tried some of their food like black bean burgers good tasting shit
nottheonion,not_removed,at this point it seems to me like there are more people complaining about any one of the not only vegans but pc culture and tumblrites than there are people who do all of those things combined
nottheonion,not_removed,dont u mean omnivores
nottheonion,not_removed,vegetarians are the new apple users nothing is cooler than mocking people for being sheep for using something youve never tried by repeating jokes youve read on the internet complaining about either is the aggressive equivalent of talking about the weather its inoffensive to most but tired out and uninteresting
nottheonion,not_removed,its super funny to me that people bitch at veganism crossfit what the fuck ever else but the more annoying people are the ones complaining outside of contexts where its relevant i have never encountered the annoying stereotype of vegans and others as portrayed on reddit
nottheonion,not_removed,i grew up vegetarian in a small town in nj my whole family was vegetarian i was never vocal about it it was just another thing to keep my head down about my schoolmates though thought it was hilarious and were continually trying to sneak meat into my lunch and then laughing after i unknowingly ate it but yeah vegans are obnoxious
nottheonion,not_removed,oh man you know what really grinds my gears when people complain about those people that complain about vegans they annoy me far more than the people who complain about vegans
nottheonion,not_removed,wheres the irony in that legitimate question
nottheonion,not_removed,thats good to know georgia is on my shortlist of places to visit i hear the nature there is incredible
nottheonion,not_removed,am in georgia right now love your country there are idiots everywhere have encountered very few here gmadlobt
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah thats what we russians said about the emerging christian activism some years back and look where that got us its a sign of a bigger problem and dismissing it wont make it fix itself
nottheonion,not_removed,haha that was pretty much my reaction if it was just a bunch of bozos flopping sausages around and just being silly i would laugh i generally have no problem with whatever people want to eat thats their business but that would just be funny however just starting some shit going as far as throwing meat in their food and harassingassaulting is by no means cool once i scrolled down some and realized its supposedly a group of neonazis that targeted this store it starts to make sense
nottheonion,not_removed,what if someone who isnt a bozo does it
nottheonion,not_removed,beat it bozo
nottheonion,not_removed,i hear gay people congregate there lets beat them with our manly sausages until theyre straight like us
nottheonion,not_removed,yes the meat and vegan stuff was actually a red herring nice to see some pick up the meat of the story
nottheonion,not_removed,im pretty sure georgian nationalists are the people you would least expert to chant soviet union rhetoric the part of the article youre talking about refers to the slogans that became popular after the fall of soviet union and georgia gaining independence
nottheonion,not_removed,this is accurate this has as much to do with meat as it does with cheese these guys are just more of the same morons whove been running around rightwinging against the sinful west for years
nottheonion,not_removed,i liked the story better when they just did it for the fuck of it
nottheonion,not_removed,i think this calls for a durian offensive
nottheonion,not_removed,brocc and load
nottheonion,not_removed,i got some celery and carrots
nottheonion,not_removed,some asparagus spears maybe
nottheonion,not_removed,broccoli is like the mace of vegetables i prefer longs words can i take celery
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah this story i mean cmon youve brat to be kidding me
nottheonion,not_removed,i just dont want people to think veganism is okay i mean what if my kids see it everywhere and take up veganism themselves s
nottheonion,not_removed,cause people gotta cram they nose in other peoples shit
nottheonion,not_removed,its more like live and let kill though as a vegan who is actually interested in activism and contributing to social change and attitude shift im not interested in shaming meat eaters or nonvegan vegetarians for their diet because its not productive its offputting whats more important is increasing the amount of vegan food eaten by nonvegans id be happier if people i know only ate animal products times a week than if went vegan
nottheonion,not_removed,like ten assholes no more representative of the average meat eater than the small number of crazy vegans are of the vegan population as a whole
nottheonion,not_removed,in florida if the meat thrown was rotting diseased or putrid that is a crime according to florida statute if it consists in whole or in part of a diseased contaminated filthy putrid or decomposed substance or if it is otherwise unfit for food
nottheonion,not_removed,give meatless mondays a try
nottheonion,not_removed,grab your sausages boys
nottheonion,not_removed,because pop culture tells us that vegans are preachy and selfrighteous and think that theres no difference between eating a hamburger and eating a baby and sadly there are a handful of vegans on youtube and tumblr who conform to the stereotype
nottheonion,not_removed,it seems like something that would happen in either georgia
nottheonion,not_removed,georgeuh like the us state
nottheonion,not_removed,its pronounced georgia like the state except located in eastern europe
nottheonion,not_removed,maybe georgia has different copyright laws
nottheonion,not_removed,thats been my only experience too so im not sure where this reputation of vegans that constantly tell you about eating meat comes from there are also many many more omnivores than vegans so i dont see why its even a thing people concern themselves with im also not sure why they give a shit about what others choose to eat it seems ok if youre a picky eater but not if you chose to do it for some ethical reason
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,yes the sausage attack goes easier if you dont clench your butt
nottheonion,not_removed,i wouldnt be clinching my butt either if sausage was involved
nottheonion,not_removed,in my experience aggressive meatitarians are far more common than militant vegans
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah the story is a lot darker than the headline promised
nottheonion,not_removed,coconuts and pineapples probably still probably going to be at a disadvantage since carnivores have bone to work with
nottheonion,not_removed,easy კივი კაფე
nottheonion,not_removed,theres a picture is the signage right in the article
nottheonion,not_removed,that shit was gold
nottheonion,not_removed,no reports of the attackers addressing anyone as demanding da poosy or announcing that they have cancer
nottheonion,not_removed,it seems like theyre protesting anything that doesnt match their hypermasculine hypernationalist meateating ultrareligious socially conservative myth of what a proper georgian man is supposed to be like
nottheonion,not_removed,nothing in this video contradicts anything from the article the neofascists were actively trying to bait the vegans into a fight so that they could get physical
nottheonion,not_removed,uh that has nothing to do with their fascist ideas
nottheonion,not_removed,solikeevery episode
nottheonion,not_removed,all right morty lets go to the universe where everyone uses sausages as weapons they may be annoying but they make the best hotdogs i kinda want that to be in an episode season can not come quicker can it
nottheonion,not_removed,the hamurais attack
nottheonion,not_removed,to most of the world adam sandlers movies are foreign films
nottheonion,not_removed,i like this people music
nottheonion,not_removed,welcome to to meat beaters the show thats about guys about guys fightin with meat
nottheonion,not_removed,this is called journalism presenting the facts and letting people decide its a terribly old fashioned idea much better to tell people what they think
nottheonion,not_removed,theyre not presenting a multiple interpretations of the event theyre prematurely shutting down an interpretation that they disagree with not that i think theyre wrong about that but its not the same thing as offering up multiple viewpoints and letting the reader decide
nottheonion,not_removed,what was surprising is that it was a good article even more surprising i read it
nottheonion,not_removed,he might be a laid back hippie but hes not a vegan he eats meat
nottheonion,not_removed,is he though it seems pretty obvious to me hes playing a character
nottheonion,not_removed,no actually that statement specifically says some people would assume that and its not because of that
nottheonion,not_removed,theyre simply saying that this story although actually a sign of much more serious issues will likely be dismissed by most as simply part of the social media backlash against vegans this being the phenomenon where people whine about annoying vegans for every actual annoying vegan
nottheonion,not_removed,could be dismissed by some clearly no providing context and an explanation is not the same as blaming someone discussions like this pop up constantly
nottheonion,not_removed,i know youre joking but labeling meateaters as crazy because of the actions of a few assholes would be no better than labelling vegans as crazy for the same reason
nottheonion,not_removed,i knew that fuckin hamurai was up to no good
nottheonion,not_removed,thats messed up im not laughing at the story i dont eat meat or drink milk actually i was just playing on the dont worry a vegan will tell you while a meat eater will assault you making someone just telling you what they eat not seem so bad
nottheonion,not_removed,a extended family member lied to me about rice being cooked in chicken broth that was awful
nottheonion,not_removed,that sucks they deserve a beating for that
nottheonion,not_removed,thats disgusting and im sorry that happened to you people can be so disrespectful im now a vegetarian but even before i was i did not eat lamb or veal i have always thought it is creepy to eat babies a friend i was eating lunch with said oh this is lamb look took a big bite got in my face was actually inches away chewed it and made gross sounds to piss me off he opened his mouth and stuck the meat out so i could see it which is completely rude and nasty then continued to put small pieces of it on my plate while we were eating he thought he was just being funny we did eventually make up and he understands what he did was wrong
nottheonion,not_removed,im glad that wasnt as risky a click as i thought it was
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah they talk about it all the time my coworker became a vegan a few months ago and she only told me when i asked why she changed up her normal lunch order no comments since every vegan i know will happily talk about it if you inquire but they mostly keep to themselves but i live in tx so the list of vegans i know is very short
nottheonion,not_removed,httpsyoutubeklyhszxwsza
nottheonion,not_removed,a sausage with a picatinny rail is an assault sausage are you licensed for that citizen
nottheonion,not_removed,no need to bring a gun to the sausage party
nottheonion,not_removed,what kind of man wears armour hotdogs
nottheonion,not_removed,exactly this thanks im so sick of the how do you know when somebodys vegan theyll tell you hahah joke as if no nonvegan ever talks about foodrestaurants normally
nottheonion,not_removed,really well said
nottheonion,not_removed,this is the best attitude
nottheonion,not_removed,i love this
nottheonion,not_removed,hitler masturbated do you masturbate
nottheonion,not_removed,i honestly feel like for every one guy i know on facebook posting about the benefits of veganism there at twenty more veggie friends just doing it and not talking about it that one person trying to be persuasive doesnt really bug me anyway
nottheonion,not_removed,i eat babies do you give a shit about my diet
nottheonion,not_removed,its hard not to care about peoples consumption of meat when its the leading cause of habitat loss ocean dead zones water pollution species loss amazon rainforest removal etc nobody would blame somebody for calling out someone else who litters yet when vegans call out omnivores for being gluttonous and apathetic towards the environment a shitstorm ensues
nottheonion,not_removed,but i can get so much karma just by disparaging a different lifestyle
nottheonion,not_removed,well as long as at least one side see it as moral issue not giving a shit about it isnt really an option its not just about eating healthy
nottheonion,not_removed,unfortunately as diet is directly related to health and medical costs i dont see it as being an issue that will die down anytime soon
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah if i want to eat oreo by the sleeves then doggone it i will i didnt ask for your input
nottheonion,not_removed,i would love it if we could just drop the whole giving a shit about everyone elses fixed it for you people love to be offended but nobody loves to be offended more than the internet masses theyre just too stupid to realize it
nottheonion,not_removed,i would love it if we could just drop the whole giving a shit about everyone else thing my dream
nottheonion,not_removed,its because is not a diet its about animals and stuff and earth or something
nottheonion,not_removed,ill say but you eat just one of the neighbors kids and from then on youre the asshole
nottheonion,not_removed,the trouble is groups like peta shout louder than the average vegan and then you regularly hear news stories about vegans making their animals sick by forcing veganism on them and indeed even the debatable issue of vegans choosing to raise their baby a vegan and choosing their beliefs over making sure the baby gets absolutely everything it needs its the exact same thing as feminism and indeed you could even say religion and other cults crazy speaks louder and then people are baited into acting stupid by it
nottheonion,not_removed,how is it extreme to not eat certain foods lol i never understood how people could call vegetarian or vegan diets extreme its like quitting smoking
nottheonion,not_removed,why do people get so upset when i make racist jokes you fellas get so butthurt you need to lighten up
nottheonion,not_removed,big tofu is out to get you
nottheonion,not_removed,just curious what made you switch from vegan to eating meat
nottheonion,not_removed,or they pick a shitty restaurant with almost no vegan options and then laugh at your cobbled together meal like no actually i dont subsist off lettuce but you picked this place that puts egg and milk into their balsamic dressing so yeah im a little limited
nottheonion,not_removed,come to a vegetarian community theyre all over the place telling us how shit we are for not giving up eggs and dairy
nottheonion,not_removed,really any recommendations
nottheonion,not_removed,ironically the use of this comic also implies superiority to everyone involved
nottheonion,not_removed,something about tofu lightly fried in nutritional yeast thats sexual word
nottheonion,not_removed,im the same i eat meat but i like veggie and vegan places cause they usually have delicious things i wouldnt try otherwise
nottheonion,not_removed,love me some nutritional yeast im not vegan but some of the best mac n cheese ive ever had was made with carrots potatoes and nutritional yeast i memorized the fucking recipe because its so easy so i might as well drop it here for anyone who wants to try chop up carrots and potatoes boil them until soft while the vegetables heat up get the blender out pour in cup each of water and oil i use vegetableolive blend add cup nutritional yeast toss in and teaspoon of salt add tablespoon lemon juice when the vegetables are soft drain them and dump them into the blender with the rest of the ingredients blend until smooth mix into cooked macaroni or whatever noodles you prefer enjoy the shit out of it
nottheonion,not_removed,i can second this i am vegan now but the food there is some of the best pub grub in portland they got another spot on alberta called bye bye thats just as good
nottheonion,not_removed,theyre almost as bad as those fuckers who complain about people complaining about people complaining about vegans those guys are the absolute worst link in the chain of complaints
nottheonion,not_removed,hitler was a vegetarian
nottheonion,not_removed,me too i eat a pescatarian diet but when i travel to other countries i make an exception so i can experience the local cuisine georgian food looks awesome
nottheonion,not_removed,reposting yet again my georgian diatribe its a wonderful country to visit ive traveled through quite a few countries and lived in three including georgia it should be at the top of any travelers list if youre into hiking camping or nature its the place to be i went with a group of friends to httpsenwikipediaorgwikivardzia a in the west then camped in khertvisi an ancient half collapsed fortress our campfire we then i took a dump in the same squatter toilet as alexander the great this is why georgia is my favorite hiking country the access to most areas worth going is unfettered the fortress is used during the day as a place for cows to when we wanted a weekend trip we picked a village near some cool nature found a httpsenwikipediaorgwikimarshrutka going there and hopped on on the way on arrival we found some shop to buy drink and food and set of for some place to camp it was beauty if you like partying tbilisi has grown quickly into an interesting and diverse place now there are interesting bars an ok selection of clubs and countless georgians to drink and eat with suggestions recommendations all about a year out of date fyi go to davit gareja hike along the border of azerbaijan and see an interesting cave city on the way back stop at a small town call udabno and stay the night at the oasis hostel and restaurant order if they have it go to dive bar hardish to find but many know it for an ultra relaxed and cheap time party with imports and georgians in equal measure play some beer pong and order a bottle of the polish vodka cheap spicy shots for your new friends canudos is a younger more georgian crowd early twenties typically with equally awesome prices and a central asian vibe go to tiflis on kandelaki street for consistently delicious georgian made for georgians though it has the overly loud music local places are known for save machakhela for late night drunk food its a tgifridays sololakis kari off of freedom square is another great place for dinner with regular georgian dance shows a little hokey but fun cafe flowers and steps are each beautiful cafes way up a hill overlooking the others side of the river try both cafe gallery for dancing your ass off to techno in a liberal atmosphere or a quiet bookread during the day batumi is a beach city frequented by many regional tourists rent a little guest house and play pool on the boardwalk for a little ritzier time svaneti is a hikers paradise but hard to get into and out of crazy marshrutka rides every single time there are many many many more tldr go to georgia immediately
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah the title sounded pretty funny but the article took a much darker turn
nottheonion,not_removed,the clown suit is not optional
nottheonion,not_removed,then they are probably a jibroni
nottheonion,not_removed,nothing ever calls for a durian offensive the collateral damage is too high
nottheonion,not_removed,the genova convention would like a word with you buddy
nottheonion,not_removed,i have a peashooter
nottheonion,not_removed,why of course you can good sir now that you mention it ill be taking a carrot lance as my weapon of choice
nottheonion,not_removed,id like your opinion on something if you dont mind in some sense i consider eating vegan incredibly difficult compared to eating vegetarian which is actually pretty simple and catered to im a vegetarian myself but i respect those who can be fully vegan nonetheless i feel like even if i were vegan id encourage people to eat vegetarian over trying to eat vegan precisely because its so much easier and would likely result in a great rate of success im curious what you think about that do you think thats a realistic strategy or do you think thats still too far to be any sort of solution
nottheonion,not_removed,ahh so youre rather they were planting stuff in those areas those people are going to destroy land no matter what and its actually the crops that are worse as they clear cut then grow but dont take proper care of the land so after a few years have to clear cut a new area because their monocultures destroyed the fertility of the land
nottheonion,not_removed,what about people who hunt or raise their own meat
nottheonion,not_removed,isnt anything dead in a state of decomposition though i understand the spirit of the law but lets face it lawmakers and those who enforce it arent the type to respect that
nottheonion,not_removed,ill try next monday then
nottheonion,not_removed,oh i was talking about tbilisi
nottheonion,not_removed,its pretty sad that mentioning the fact that killing and eating animals harms them is considered vegan rhetoric
nottheonion,not_removed,words of wisdom
nottheonion,not_removed,it also helps if youre not a pickle slicer
nottheonion,not_removed,i guess it depends on the person it makes sense that id never have to deal with an aggressive meat eater
nottheonion,not_removed,so both and more
nottheonion,not_removed,can confirm
nottheonion,not_removed,it can with excessive amounts of alchohol
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,adam sandler films are foreign to everyone
nottheonion,not_removed,brought to you by spishaks meatbeaters
nottheonion,not_removed,nailed roilands drunken stumble
nottheonion,not_removed,thats the really dangerous part if you just present two opposing views then you can easily claim to be balanced and people will assume theyve got all the facts even if theres no guarantee that those two viewpoints are in any way exhaustive implicitly youre being asked to take sides with an assumption that one side or the other is right they might both be wrong maybe theres a third and fourth perspective we havent heard but the appeal of conflictoriented journalism where you pit two opinions against each other is such that these nuances will not be missed because the duel is such a strong narrative and it distracts you from making up your own mind which might not coincide with either side
nottheonion,not_removed,taken to the extreme its also what destroyed journalism the view from nowhere gave absurdity a podium presented as equally valid to the obvious truth in order to appear unbiased
nottheonion,not_removed,yup quickly dismisses what will be the most common interpretation then gives one of their own just one neo nazi sausage eaters
nottheonion,not_removed,perhaps he is a veterinarian
nottheonion,not_removed,hes a real hippie spiritual dude he does kinds of videos on his channel serious and caricature ultraspirituallife is the caricature tag
nottheonion,not_removed,hes a vegan pretending to be a carnivore makjng fun of veganslike a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude
nottheonion,not_removed,aaaand this is why reading comprehension is taught in primary schools so relentlessly if someone can write a perfectly legible statement yet some readers take away the exact opposite meaning weve got a problem
nottheonion,not_removed,well it goes even deeper than that people call vegans extremecrazy yet those who eat meat pay for the systematic slaughter of thousands of animals
nottheonion,not_removed,due to the nature of my workplace i end up talking about food with different workers every few weeks it gets awkwerd when ive talked about being a vegan once a fortnight for the last months
nottheonion,not_removed,my dad does this my aunt comes by once a year for christmas and my parents cook the christmas roast potatoes in goose fat it didnt really cross my mind for years until i cooked a roast dinner for some friends a couple of them were vegetarian so i did a separate batch of potatoes in sunflower oil it made me realise that my parents never do this and so i asked about it turns out my dads just never mentioned it to her
nottheonion,not_removed,id say that happens a lot vegetarian from brazil happened to me as well thats why nowadays i usually dont accept invitations to dinners
nottheonion,not_removed,people dont understand that this is food poisoning it can give you serious diarrhea and dehydration
nottheonion,not_removed,thats happened to me too but by my mom chicken broth and fat i could taste it and i ended up getting really nauseous i have ocd so psychosomatic illness in response to bad food is my jam apparently i didnt finish that particular dish so she wouldnt speak to me and i ended up just going home good times but yeah i hate getting jabbed at or people trying to sneakily get me to eat meat i dont push it in anyones faces no one knows im vegetarian unless theyre ordering food with me or something like that where i need to specify no meat yet some people really fixate on it i get why people do that its just gotten old after years of hearing it lol
nottheonion,not_removed,jesus wtf
nottheonion,not_removed,there are some people who talk about it a lot but then theres always some people who talk about what they do a lot when it comes to any sort of hobby or preference its odd how vegans are singled out im vegetarian myself and just never really bother to mention it to anyone took nearly a year before my own parents noticed
nottheonion,not_removed,who the hell are you hanging out with
nottheonion,not_removed,splashing blood on your food is at the very least quite disgusting next time you should spit on their meat and tell its just another animal byproduct edit it sounded less dirty on my mind
nottheonion,not_removed,doing that is like you hawking a loogie into someone elses food its still perfectly edible by your standards
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah thats just a straight up dick move
nottheonion,not_removed,yes because trying to kill someone is the same as being a dick and tricking you to eat something you dont like to eat
nottheonion,not_removed,while its a shitty thing to do its not really comparable to messing with someone with a peanut allergy its extremely disrespectful to deliberately contaminate a vegetarians food but its attempted murder to deliberately contaminate the food of someone with an allergy with their allergen
nottheonion,not_removed,bet she never thought shed fight a toddler over a meter long dildo
nottheonion,not_removed,that kids going places
nottheonion,not_removed,httpimgurcomkkhsevu
nottheonion,not_removed,of course not i have to preserve my precious bodily fluids
nottheonion,not_removed,its like that with most things the vocal minority of a group are responsible for how people view the entire group
nottheonion,not_removed,the only friend of mine whos pushy and annoying about his lifestyle isnt vegan he just talks about how people who dont work out are really unhealthy
nottheonion,not_removed,often if one person posts about the benefits of veganism about other people comment on it with stupid jokes like vegetarian is an old native american word for bad hunter hurr hurr
nottheonion,not_removed,its the same with a lot of stuff christians complaining about the war on christmas redditors complaining about radical feminisists etc
nottheonion,not_removed,many animals eat their babies its natural besides human need protein and gettting it from babies is the only way i can think of
nottheonion,not_removed,no thats true the meat industry is really awful i guess i was referring to people trying to police each other because of personal preference and how obnoxious that becomes that said yeah the meat industry is generally very bad for the earth i dont see it as a matter of making people not eat meat though i think its in the hands of the shit companies running the industry if we could eat less meat and farm it responsibly than it could be sustainable
nottheonion,not_removed,exactly i always say that if people actually gave a shit about climate change and preserving the environment rather than just pretending to for social expediency then they would stop or drastically reduce their meat consumption but they dont so they dont full disclosure i still eat meat ive just cut my consumption waaay back from an every day thing to a once or twice a week thing but full disclosure again that is more of a healthpersonal preference choice i dont actually give a shit about climate change but at least i dont pretend to
nottheonion,not_removed,this is why people who complain about vegetarians bother me much more than vegetarians themselves
nottheonion,not_removed,yea assuming others are glutinous and apathetic towards the environment based on them eating meat cant imagine why people would think youre a dick for saying that
nottheonion,not_removed,disparaging get your fingers off my asparagus
nottheonion,not_removed,yes and vegan are one of the only groups that doctors recommend take daily vitamins because they are not getting the proper amounts from their diet hows that for healthy
nottheonion,not_removed,more specifically its about the environment animal farming produces a lot of greenhouse gasses and other waster efficiency you can feed one person if you fill acres with cattle and crops for cattle feed or if you fill it with soybeans vegan diets are a good step towards solving starvation and ethics is it right to kill another animal when we dont need to which is more of a subjective matter than the other two also there is arguments on both sides about health vegans may get ironprotein deficiencies but then they avoid quite alot of fats and such not to mention any diseases that propagate through meat that being said really its your choice being vegan or even vegetarian is not going to save the world and the future may turn out good even if everyone stays omnivores
nottheonion,not_removed,whats really funny about that is that most of the vegans i know dont like peta either
nottheonion,not_removed,i dont really think raising your baby vegan is debatable you can get everything you need by being vegan my kid is vegan and shes months old now just recently went to the doctor and everything was perfect told me to keep doing whatever were doing my doctors a meat eater and never once said it was a problem raising her vegan when i told her youre thinking of crazy news articles where vegan parents are stupid and mentally ill or something and just give their kid soy milk a normal vegan is not that dumb
nottheonion,not_removed,its almost like extremists are stupid poisonous and annoying
nottheonion,not_removed,most of us vegans hate peta its annoying how everyone thinks they represent veganism
nottheonion,not_removed,i developed anemia and diabetes and acne and i was overweight in a desperate attempt i experimented by eating meat and my health improved significantly wont go back now
nottheonion,not_removed,so in both cases the majority is trying to get people to conform and its not about being vegan at all
nottheonion,not_removed,mono stereo the the old hairdressers and the flying duck all of those places are owned by the same people so guaranteed vegetarianvegan food there are probably others but i cant think of any
nottheonion,not_removed,thats the mouse over text
nottheonion,not_removed,and you do too my turn superiorsuperiorsuperiortimesinfinityplusone
nottheonion,not_removed,for sure great food has its roots in taking what might be considered to be subpar food and making it taste great
nottheonion,not_removed,i would love to see more restaurants expand their not meat or minimal meat offerings meat is not usually at the top of my list of things i want to eat
nottheonion,not_removed,ive been meaning to try out some freaky vegan foods and this sounds like a fun place to start thanks for the recipe
nottheonion,not_removed,im replying so i can find this recipe sounds delicious
nottheonion,not_removed,seriously saving and trying that
nottheonion,not_removed,since when was hitler a neonazi
nottheonion,not_removed,hitler liked to call himself vegetarian but he also apparently didnt think things like ham and pigeon counted or maybe it was a pr thing regardless the guy wasnt really a vegetarian
nottheonion,not_removed,oh lol
nottheonion,not_removed,actually one of the coolest things about georgian food is that it has a long history of vegetarian and veganism religious fasting in georgian orthodox is abstaining from animal products so if you ever want to go veggie or vegan just tell them youre samarkhvo fasting
nottheonion,not_removed,what if i throw you one of the swedish canned fish
nottheonion,not_removed,genova is a type of grape geneva is a city in switzerland where the geneva conventions were signed youre thinking of the geneva protocol also signed in geneva which outlaws the use of chemical and biological weapons the geneva conventions are a set of protocols for the treatment of noncombatants and prisonersofwar
nottheonion,not_removed,what about it exactly do you think is hard i went vegan overnight from eating meat and dairy practically every meal and have never found it particularly difficult
nottheonion,not_removed,what if the meat was still frozen
nottheonion,not_removed,hell im alive and im decomposing
nottheonion,not_removed,so is any plant thats been picked is throwing grass also applicable under your interpretation
nottheonion,not_removed,thats the city most people say tuhbleesee which isnt quite right but close enough
nottheonion,not_removed,hes been there
nottheonion,not_removed,that reference i get it
nottheonion,not_removed,to be fair ive never experienced either one outside of reddit and reddit is also the place where people say they could never date a girl that had a well done steak because it shows serious personality flaws that could never be overcome so i try to take whats said here with a grain of salt or a block of salt
nottheonion,not_removed,ive been both meat eaters give vegans far more shit than vegans give meat eaters vegans are also undisputedly in the right to call out meat eaters for contributing to the destruction of our environment
nottheonion,not_removed,yup those annoying vegans who bother you are themselves bothered by annoying omnivores its an endless cycle of people refusing to just leave others alone to do their thing
nottheonion,not_removed,usually when ive had excessive amounts of alcohol it takes way longer to come
nottheonion,not_removed,im pretty sure this is french
nottheonion,not_removed,im now picturing highbrow art film critics analyzing the sociopolitical and racial implications brought up by waterboy
nottheonion,not_removed,when you want to beat your meat with the guys nothing beats better than spishaks meatbeaters
nottheonion,not_removed,its a difficult thing to decide on either you show all sides however ludicrous or you filter out the clearly stupid and show the sensible sides but then you are applying your subjective view and are not being impartial should flat earthers be shown discussing issues of geography should there be a pastafarian representative during theological debates holocaust deniers at memorial services the theory of climate change is massively backed by the scientific community should deniers be ignored how many historic scientific geniuses were derided and mocked in their time only to be shown right later on often after a student stumbles across a neglected and forgotten paper and investigates the insane theories a bit more im not saying that climate change deniers are right only that consensus isnt always the best way forward and that sometimes even wackos have something to say modern journalism doesnt even try though outlets have a prejudiced outlook and will run stories that back this up and spin any that dont fit to match
nottheonion,not_removed,of course the more exhaustive and the more viewpoints the better the shitty part nowadays is that most articles only present exactly one viewpoint is that an improvement sure if that viewpoint happens to coincide with the one you already believe
nottheonion,not_removed,i actually wrote a paper involving how we always have some kind of dualistic view even since before socrates time pm me if youre interested anyone
nottheonion,not_removed,sausage wielding nazis who hate foreigners vegans gays and rick and morty this is maybe the strangest article ive ever read
nottheonion,not_removed,so robert downey jr
nottheonion,not_removed,that statement carries a lot less shock value to omnivores dude
nottheonion,not_removed,wow thats just very inconsiderate but compliments to you for not doing the same mistake
nottheonion,not_removed,it happens from time to time best part is when the person who does not eat said food raves about how good it tastes
nottheonion,not_removed,just start carrying a thermos of soup and a flask with you to peoples houses youll look like a cowboy
nottheonion,not_removed,i have a friend who was raised vegetarian he says whenever he accidentally eats meat it fucks his literal shit up people dont understand that their digestive systems basically arent used to meant
nottheonion,not_removed,took nearly a year before my own parents noticed so did your own diet just rarely include meat already were you just subtle about it
nottheonion,not_removed,assholes
nottheonion,not_removed,next time you should spit shit on their meat and tell its just another animal byproduct
nottheonion,not_removed,the peanut analogy is definitely extreme the lactose one isnt great but partly works usually lactose doesnt kill people who are lactose intolerant it just makes them sick meat with non meat eaters is often similar its more just morbid as fuck to them and therefore a wicked dick move imagine someone throwing dogs blood in your food
nottheonion,not_removed,but you dont necessarily know why someone doesnt eat meat they could be vegan for ethical reasons but also be allergic to meat if someone doesnt eat meat you dont trick them into eating meat it doesnt matter why
nottheonion,not_removed,rnocontext
nottheonion,not_removed,not college but places
nottheonion,not_removed,where do you live i live in los angeles and there a few people like that every once in a while but usually people dont mention anything
nottheonion,not_removed,i think the problem with being a vegan is its next to impossible to be quite about it unless you literally never talk about food or eat with others meat and dairy especially is such a staple part of our diet that you have to go out of your way to avoid such food off the top of my head i cant even think of the last meal ive had that was vegan salad nope ranch dressing cereal nope milk mexican ha even my ice coffee had cream in it it just creates weird amounts of tension because a vegan diet is so different that even if you dont mean too its impossible not to bring up
nottheonion,not_removed,being realistic if theres a demand then theres a supply too companies are going to make their stockholders as happy as possible and if theres people willing to base every meal around meat then how do you expect the companies are going to do anything with increasing population im pretty sure its nearly impossible to farm meat and dairy responsibly we simply dont have the land only way i can see it happening is the governments of the world coming together to impose sanctions on citizens which would likely never happen until the climate goes seriously tits up
nottheonion,not_removed,to preface what im about to say i entirely agree with you the meat industry is absolute shit im glad we are on the same page but it sounds like youre passing the blame the reason the meat industry is the way it is is because its economically impossible to meet the commercial demand for meat without having a tremendous and destructive environmental impact its the consumers fault for demanding this much meat in the first place sure people are going to eat meat but do we really need to eat this much of it if someone realizes the extent of damage the meat industry causes but continues to eat the same quantity of meat while saying its not me its the industry to justify their actions are they not still part of the problem in addition theres a simple way any single person can do something to make a difference stop eating meat or at least eat much less of it its not an unreasonable option considering the hundreds of millions of vegetarians in the world
nottheonion,not_removed,from someone who does actually give a shit i want to thank you for cutting back no matter the reason
nottheonion,not_removed,how can you justify eating meat when it is the leading cause of everything i listed above eating meat is not necessary the only logical reason to eat meat is it tastes good seconds of mouth pleasure vs the preservation of our planet if you choose the seconds of mouth pleasure knowing it causes so much harm to the environment how is that not gluttony
nottheonion,not_removed,ive never really listened to all of the precautions doctors advise myself i think doctors might recommend a daily multivitamin for everyone tailored specifically for their sex and age but as i said i never really paid attention you have received some downvotes and i assume that the reason is related to that or people disagreeing about the healthiness of being a vegan i personally believe it is unhealthy but im sure there are a lot of people who would argue the other way i have crazy digestive issues without doing anything else to my body so ill stick to my red meat thankyouverymuch
nottheonion,not_removed,just keep in mind a lot of those studies include things like parched grassland as what we could be eating its rather unfortunate what we need is to fix the industries rather than let them pit us against eachother like it was some sort of cowbortion debate if they werent trying to make billions instead of millions per year things wouldnt be nearly as bad for the animals or our lands
nottheonion,not_removed,that being said really its your choice being vegan or even vegetarian is not going to save the world and the future may turn out good even if everyone stays omnivores not for the animals it wont and thats the entire point of veganism
nottheonion,not_removed,that is kinda my point peta do more harm than good for both animal welfare and the dignity of vegans loud and crazy sharing a platform with reasonable people drags down the reasonable
nottheonion,not_removed,just a vegetarian but yeah fuck peta and their shock tactics with a rusty rake
nottheonion,not_removed,peta is to vegans as the nra is to gun owners both of them represent valued interests to a lot of people but wind up giving in to loudmouth wealthy donors like whiney celebrities or rightwing lunatics
nottheonion,not_removed,why would i want my children to consume cholesterol saturated fats endotoxins etc endotoxins you need to read more legitimate sources
nottheonion,not_removed,extremism is what it is like if farts were contagious like yawns
nottheonion,not_removed,youre just afraid of your point going up in smoke
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah also bloc ushas note ranjits kitchen byblos cafe marthas the project cafe im sure there are more
nottheonion,not_removed,hed be a protonazi
nottheonion,not_removed,either way he praised vegetarianism as an ideal which makes an antivegetarian attack by his followers ironic
nottheonion,not_removed,wasnt beaver considered a fish at one point in american history hitler thinking pigeon isnt meat might not be as strange as it seems
nottheonion,not_removed,he was definitely a vegetarian but it had a lot to do with his stomach problems if i recall i remember his vegetarian habits coming up quite a few time in speers memoirs and he definitely stuck to it for personal reasons
nottheonion,not_removed,the swedish army doesnt even need tear gas throw that stuff into a crowd of people and the street will be empty for weeks
nottheonion,not_removed,i think you missed the joke a durian is a fruit so they used genova as a fruit pun i thought it was pretty cleverly subtle
nottheonion,not_removed,genova is also a city in italy although i am not aware of any convention that was signed there
nottheonion,not_removed,as a vegetarian who wants to go vegan the main problem im having is that milk and eggs are present in so many processed foods my favourite baked goods are off the table pretty much all of the vegetarian meats at my local supermarket contain eggs so theyre out microwave meals are off limits unless i want endless vegetable soup dont get me started on pizza it feels like veganism would force me to make a lot of foods from scratch that i previously took for granted my dietary choice would stop being a minor inconvenience and start being a major lifestyle choice with that said some switches away from dairy have been easy oat milk is fucking godly
nottheonion,not_removed,he is choosing a dvd for tonight
nottheonion,not_removed,well meat eaters are contributing to the leading cause of habitat loss water pollution removal of the amazon rainforest species extinction ocean nitrification and much more while vegans are making a huge effort to reduce their carbon footprint i think vegans are in the right to call out meat eaters the same way anybody would be right to call out someone who litters
nottheonion,not_removed,its the fuckin way she goes there rick
nottheonion,not_removed,however we can be certain that he is one of the ricks from one of the universes
nottheonion,not_removed,it could be one of any of the infinite ricks from other dimensions or maybe the dimension we live in is one where everyone is secretly a mutation of rick without knowing we are
nottheonion,not_removed,no its a tiny fucking rick
nottheonion,not_removed,well hes dancing but saying its not a dance
nottheonion,not_removed,username not quite checking out
nottheonion,not_removed,
nottheonion,not_removed,oh dear his movies are even more obnoxious than i remember
nottheonion,not_removed,can confirm it is not french
nottheonion,not_removed,waterboy was still a good movie imo it doesnt deserve to be lumped in with some other crap sandler did
nottheonion,not_removed,journalists see themselves as arbiters of truth they will aim to filter out the noise and zoom in on a particular conflict
nottheonion,not_removed,you never know who may be effected by it while it annoys people there is no harm is saying it
nottheonion,not_removed,its a massive dick move to purposely deceive someone into violating their dietary restrictions whether or not they thought the food tasted good is irrelevant
nottheonion,not_removed,if i were american id probably do that with a can of httpswwwsoylentcom
nottheonion,not_removed,ive known this since a pretty young age after witnessing what happened to a formerly vegetarian schoolfriend after he ate hotdogs
nottheonion,not_removed,i never knew this but im so glad i know now thats just a whole new level of horrible
nottheonion,not_removed,this is psychosomatic fyi your body doesnt magically lose the ability to digest protein if it did youd already be dead
nottheonion,not_removed,what was the point that she was proving that she was a bitch with little consideration for other people
nottheonion,not_removed,can confirm my mom used to do this to me when i first became vegetarian she would blend in meat with dishes that normally dont have meat like mac cheese
nottheonion,not_removed,that kind of aggression with food is really primitive its personality disordered ugh
nottheonion,not_removed,its only common among assholes thats not something a decent person of any sort would do
nottheonion,not_removed,allergic to meat
nottheonion,not_removed,to be fair all of those things you listed are not difficult to veganize have you tried nut milk
nottheonion,not_removed,im just learning about veganism and what really got me intrigued was with all this damage these companies are doing the government continues to subsidize them subsidies need to end first imo then well see what happens from there
nottheonion,not_removed,right thats what i see as one of the biggest problems of our economic system though is that the most basic desires and immediate gratifications tend to win over the market regardless of how reckless they may be and what the long term consequences are i dont know enough about political science to know how to change that or necessarily what a better alternative is but i know enough to see that it is certainly not good for our culture
nottheonion,not_removed,well why not just apply the same techniques that have reduced smoking across the board educate people on the damage that meat overconsumption does to the planet and their bodies provide a decent alternative delicious cheap vegetarian food and finally if you need to tax the shit out of it so that people are forced to see it as an occasional luxury than an every single meal type thing im generally against using tax to enforce social policy so that last one should be a last resort but there is no arguing that it is effective
nottheonion,not_removed,if theres a demand then theres a supply too except for unicorns
nottheonion,not_removed,they wont change unless they see a demand for change it really is easier to stop eating meat than to try and change the entire system
nottheonion,not_removed,im almost convinced peta is some sort of cointel operation secretly funded by the meat industry to discredit the whole movement
nottheonion,not_removed,saturated fats are also kinda important for maintaining energy too
nottheonion,not_removed,or just a nonaffixed nazi
nottheonion,not_removed,nazotype
nottheonion,not_removed,yeah i spose fair enough interestingly whilst he claimed to be a teetotaler and a vegetarian he was known to be partial to beer and bavarian sausages he was a parttimer at best fuckin casuals
nottheonion,not_removed,i thought that was because canadian catholics wanted a loophole for the whole no meat on friday thing
nottheonion,not_removed,a black person was considered only of a person at one point in american history as well
nottheonion,not_removed,you thought me more intelligent than i actually am in german the city is called genf and i couldnt be arsed to find out what the correct english word is
nottheonion,not_removed,i think you would actually be really surprised at the availability of accidentally vegan foods i think you may not be in the same country as me im in the us and i dont think oat milk is very popular here but seems to be in europe but hopefully some of my knowledge still applies baked goods are one of those things you can always make yourself buttttttt i have found that there are some things like supermarket fruit pies or refrigerated prepared pies that are often vegan oreos are vegan if you go to health food storesfancy groceries like whole foods they will of course have vegan baked goods at least in the us we have very good options for vegan microwave meals and veg meats ie amys gardein field roast beyond meat quorn tofurky yves lightlife sweet earth etc vegan pizza is also widelyeasily available lots of chains now offer vegan cheese brixx mellow mushroom blaze mod z pizza and at more traditional places like dominos papa johns and pizza hut they usually have at least vegan dough and you can forgo the cheese on a veggie pizza to some people that sounds like sacrilege but papa johns veggie pizza minus cheese pineapple smothered in their garlic sauce is heavenly even sweet chilli doritos are vegan i think its just one of those things that appears harder than it is in practice
nottheonion,not_removed,im a vegetarian so i dont disagree with you about the harms of eating meat that being said ive never seen an aggressive vegan actually convince someone to go from omnivore or bloodmouth as one aggressive vegan i knew called it to vegan if anything i think that most aggressive vegans push people away from it i think its great if people want to share recipes with omnivores so they know we dont all just eat lettuce and sadness all of the time if someone asks me why im vegetarian i will tell them the people who are close to me may very very rarely get gentle reminders of how it would be good for them to cut back on meat consumption but getting up in strangers faces isnt changing anything the big difference between littering and eating meat is that littering is already socially unacceptable if you guilt someone who litters they already know that theyve done something wrong guilting someone who eats meat is kind of like what the westborro baptist church does we may know that were in the right and what they are doing is bad for themselves and everyone else but most people dont agree so we come off as jerks for doing it
nottheonion,not_removed,i only eat meat i hunt how am i adding to any of those things im sure all those soy beans and rice fields are natrual
nottheonion,not_removed,aw geez ray i dont know
nottheonion,not_removed,way o the road bud
nottheonion,not_removed,so people keep telling me billy madison and happy gilmore were sandlers best comedy films but this clip isnt showing a good picture of this uuuh picture he is just acting like a mentally handicapped person while in happy he was just an idiot
nottheonion,not_removed,if youre gonna claim that the current mode of internet journalism was created as an intentional evolution of a movement whose own wiki page claims it to have died over thirty years ago i think i wanna see some evidence i think its fair to point out that any journalistic outlet purporting to be objective is either deliberately misleading or too naive to be trusted the stories themselves may be represented in a more or less objective light but someone has always decided what stories get to be told someone has always decided whats important news publications have been blatantly associated with specific political goals since they came about the fact that they tend to be less subtle about it today doesnt really mean theyre any worse edit if youre downvoting please make an argument im happy to discuss this seems shitty to just say fuck you without any more consideration
nottheonion,not_removed,dont care never will
nottheonion,not_removed,you could talk about agricultural efficiency and sustainability instead in very simple and logical terms it costs less of the planets resources to grow plants to feed us than to grow plants to grow animals to feed us anyone who doesnt flat out deny the marching ecological disaster that is humanity can see reason in that statement whereas meat is murder will largely just cause eyes to roll
nottheonion,not_removed,thats how kids often learn that they actually like food that they find icky
nottheonion,not_removed,ooh til its available in canada i think im actually going to look into this i have been eating terribly for years not excessively im actually underweight
nottheonion,not_removed,if youre in the eu go for joylent
nottheonion,not_removed,it isnt actually true though i mean vegans will claim it is true it isnt your body doesnt magically lose the ability to stop digesting protein youd be dead if that was the case because you need it to survive if you eat large amounts of meat after not eating any meat at all like eating a gigantic steak or something you might end up with an upset stomach but like eating a bit of meat or something cooked in chicken broth wont make you sick at all this doesnt mean none of them will feel sick a psychosomatic reaction is possible wherein they literally make themselves sick because they believe they will be sick rather similar to other nocebos it is all in their head
nottheonion,not_removed,its a well known fact that your body adapts to your diet this is why people who regularly eat certain foods tolerate it better than people who never do same reason why certain cultures regularly eat hot peppers and are just fine but people who almost never eat them burn on the inside and shit fire after a couple
nottheonion,not_removed,httpacaaiorgallergiestypesfoodallergiestypesfoodallergymeatallergy httpacaaiorgallergiestypesfoodallergiestypesfoodallergymeatallergy httpacaaiorgallergiestypesfoodallergiestypesfoodallergymeatallergy
nottheonion,not_removed,as a long time server i am guilty of an eye roll at peoples ordering requests one day i just thought why do i actually give a fuck they have a right to ask me questions as thats my job making them uncomfortable is just peanut stupid as they should get what they want as a paying customer if they cant get what they want then they eat at home and that leaves me without a job now i try my best to fulfil their requests which honestly customers find refreshing and puts us both in a good mood
nottheonion,not_removed,as a restaurant owner we all curse about vegans and allergies but only in one situation if they dont tell us until its too late one of my restaurants in particular has a very targeted very limited and specific menu with about seats that dont flip chef loves to accommodate anyone and will often call guests with allergies the day before they come to get some more details since his ingredients can be a bit off the wall when we take reservations we ask about dietary restrictions and still about of vegansallergiesglutenwhatever just dont tell us so now theyre sitting in a restaurant that would have gone out of their way to accommodate them asking about vegan options when they are expecting food in minutes urgh
nottheonion,not_removed,when i was in sweden recently for business i went into many restaurants hat couldnt cater for my vegetarian not even vegan diet i was tired hungry and fed up when i walked into a place and said im a vegetarian the waitress was a little nervous but talked to the chef who made up the most beautiful vegetarian meal i was in tears i went back twice both times the chef made something different and equally delicious for a lower cost than anything else on the menu i like to think the chef enjoyed going off menu but if not i tipped very generously
nottheonion,not_removed,im vegetarian and worked in a high end barbecue restaurant so ive gotten to witness this from both sides the typical western diet is also a big culprit of it as all of our meals involve a lot of meat or dairy products trying to find food without them at a restaurant isnt easy to do when the typical meat or dairy free dish is a salad nobody wants to eat its no wonder why theyre seen as snobbish or picky when theres typically little or nothing to choose from i hold a lot of respect for vegetarians or vegans that go out to eat with their friends its not easy to put yourself and your beliefs on a back burner for others for something so routine in our lives like food
nottheonion,not_removed,subsidies need to end first taking responsibility for your actions is the logical first step
nottheonion,not_removed,subsidies wont end until enough of the politically empowered realize they are supporting an unethical industry the first step has to be to make more vegans
nottheonion,not_removed,prediction markets daos and liquid democracy should in theory give an economic benefit for people doing things now that benefit society in the long term while still allowing capitalism to thrive
nottheonion,not_removed,unfortunately smoking isnt as hard to change as the diet of an entire society smoking was a very hard uphill battle in order to promote the dangers linked to it limit access and crack down on the industry its common sense that smoking is bad for you and quitting is relatively easy food is a whole other ball game though meat and dairy consumption are part of every meal of the standard western diet and its public knowledge that more meat consumption has a lot of negative health and environmental impacts but agribusiness is as corrupt as it is big a revolving door exists between their lobbyists and the fda and the usda just look at the efforts made from corn refiners to legally change the name of high fructose corn syrup to just corn sugar the gag orders preventing whistleblowing on hazardous or unethical farming and the legal battle that ensued when factory poultry farms fought against an increase in cage sizing that would allow the birds to have enough room to turn around hell the whole damn food pyramid has been flawed from the beginning tobacco was relatively easy to fight against compared to agribusiness overeating is an american past time i couldnt imagine being a server at the restaurant i work at if we tried to follow healthy eating standards after watching customers shovel food in their mouth as if their train to auschwitz was departing right out front i have a hard time believing that american society is willing to change their eating habits until we can get all of our calories in pill form and spend the rest of our lives on those sweetass chairs from walle
nottheonion,not_removed,i think changing the perception of meat as necessary for every meal is particularly important public awareness of the consequences will help too for sure but we could probably farm fairly sustainably if we just cut down on our intake enough and this is more palatable to the public than infringing on their rights in some way like taxes which is unlikely to ever have enough support that a govt would agree to it especially since many countries farm animals as a decent part of their economy and then labgrown meat eventually from my end we try to make farming more environmentally friendly and humane i eat meat once or twice a week and its usually fish but i am a student of the animal agriculture field
nottheonion,not_removed,the sad thing is that this wouldnt actually be farfetched considering the things that have been done by big industries already time and time again weve been shocked by industrys secrets and schemes peta are crazy enough for it to fit
nottheonion,not_removed,i will say i do like which is their youth program the most extreme thing they have done is go to colleges and give a virtual reality presentation of slaughter houses
nottheonion,not_removed,drag smoke way to ruin it ruiner
nottheonion,not_removed,oh sorry about that ill tag you as assume to be less intelligent than appears so i dont make that mistake again
nottheonion,not_removed,thanks for the tips you guessed correctly that im in a different country uk so some of your advice is more applicable than others i imagine things would be easier if i lived in london in my current town of residence vegan cheese and pizza are pretty hard to come by with that said my cupboard is full of oreos
nottheonion,not_removed,im a vegetarian hypocrite ftfy ive never seen an aggressive vegan actually convince someone to go from omnivore or bloodmouth as one aggressive vegan i knew called it to vegan if anything i think that most aggressive vegans push people away from it i think its important to expose peoples hypocrisy and come off much more aggressive over the internet than irl as i think people of the internet can handle it but getting up in strangers faces isnt changing anything i wouldnt get up in someones elses face physically but i think it is strange that people wouldnt blame someone for cursing at someone for littering but think its pushy to inform people that their dietary choices are far more damaging than something like littering the big difference between littering and eating meat is that littering is already socially unacceptable very true most people arent aware of the impact of their dietary choices but people are always much more disconnected and resistant to change when it comes to food for a reason i suspect is imprinted deep into our dna any source of calories is necessary when starvation is a possibility westborro baptist church does we may know that were in the right you lost me here
nottheonion,not_removed,i only eat meat i hunt how am i adding to any of those things hunting in accordance to regulations and quotas set by wildlife biologists and ecologists appears to be necessary and completely ethical the issues i could see there are of americans do not consume solely animal products they caught themselves and if everyone who eats meat suddenly became a hunter there would be nowhere near enough meat for people to continue to consume the amount of meat americans are eating today do you ever order animal products when you eat out do you ever eat eggs cheese milk yogurt butter ranch dressing any other type of dairy or bakedprocessed goods containing any of above these ingredients if you are you are clearly contributing to all the things i originally listed its definitely respectable to only eat meat that you hunt im sure all those soy beans and rice fields are natrual any animal product you can think of is the result of an animal eating grains like soybeans or rice and converting a very small portion of that energy into something you would consume it takes of grain to make of meat the majority of grains are produced solely for the purpose of feeding livestock eating lower on the food chain will always be less resource demanding
nottheonion,not_removed,way of the road bubbs
nottheonion,not_removed,those are just the films of his that came out when the average redditor was still young enough to enjoy adam sandler films they then look back at those times and fail to realise that it was them that changed not adam sandler
nottheonion,not_removed,and those who went vegan for those reasons tend to not stay vegan i really dont care how cringe worthy my words are people are aware of what animal agricultural does to the planet yet do nothing to change their habits you mention what animal agriculture does what have you changed
nottheonion,not_removed,adults that have chosen a vegan vegetarian pescatarian etc diet for ethical or health reasons are not children treating them as such is disrespectful
nottheonion,not_removed,i can get behind getting fussy eaters to try new things its irrational to dislike a food because you think its bad without even trying it and thats not a stance i feel deserves respect however if someone is avoiding foods because of ethical dietary or religious reasons then those are things you should respect even if you dont agree with them and youre a prick if you dont respect those reasons and deliberately contaminate their food and whether it tastes good has nothing to do with it how the food tastes has nothing to do with their choice whether or not to eat it if i went vegetarian tomorrow which is highly unlikely im not going to find that a steak suddenly tastes foul to me but id be pissed if someone tricked me into eating one
nottheonion,not_removed,im in south americabrazil i search for a similar national product but found nothing i also looked into making my own but found out that eating at my universitys restaurant is way way cheaper
nottheonion,not_removed,people blow it out of proportion but it is definitely true to a certain extent ive been vegan close to years and had a few lapses in judgement along the way when i consumed a fairly significant amount of cheese this resulted in me spending a very significant amount of time glued to the toilet due to horrible diarrhea before i was vegan i never had any issues digesting dairy i cant comment on meat digestion though as i simply havent eaten it
nottheonion,not_removed,your body doesnt magically lose the ability to stop digesting protein what are you even talking about why do so many meateaters think protein means meat for me whether or not it would make you sick isnt the point its fucking disgusting i dont want to eat some dead animal imagine eating some soup and then being told oh by the way that wasnt chicken you just ate your dead cat no biggie lol because thats about as close as i can describe to how disgusted most vegans would be
nottheonion,not_removed,i agree that this is largely a myth the human digestive system is highly adaptable if you havent had meat in a while and then go right to a primarily meat diet you might feel a little sick for a day or two while your body adjusts i dont know many vegans that would claim this is true though its largely just a younger vocal minority ive been vegan for nearly two decades and have never heard of anyone actually getting sick from going back to eating meat
nottheonion,not_removed,yes but it isnt really that big of a difference there arent any studies which show that vegetarians or vegans struggle to switch back over to a meatbased diet indeed over of vegetarians end up reverting to eating meat suggesting that there is no particular difficulty in doing so
nottheonion,not_removed,my husband and i are both vegetarian but my family whom we eat with a lot is emphatically not so when they want to try a new restaurant that has literally no veg options and i dont want to be the buzzkill that says i cant eat there sorry guys i deeply appreciate servers like you who dont give me a ton of shit for asking if there was any way i could get anything without meat as well as the kitchen staff for making it happen i know its irritating and easy to say why not just stay at home or find a vegfriendly restaurant but for birthday dinners or vacation outings etc its nice to be able to be out with my family and eat something in the process
nottheonion,not_removed,i was a line cook for quite a few years and as long as it was a reasonable request i didnt care if we had the ingredients and the equipment needed to do it id make the customers anything they wanted on or off the menu sometimes it could be annoying if we were really busy but generally i enjoyed doing something different
nottheonion,not_removed,you just killed their only child little jimmy with that careless peanut left in your paragraph you may have been trying your best but it just wasnt good enough murderer
nottheonion,not_removed,wow thats wow talk about them having their heads up their arses
nottheonion,not_removed,uk veganer here i dont think being a vegan has to be so black and white there can be some nuance i eat oysters and mussels because i have found no evidence that they feel pain and they are environmentally positive to farm when they form shells they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere rope caught only theres a good article that goes into more details here you could be a vegan that chooses to support specifically vegetarianvegan brands quorn for instance that still use some nonvegan products ie eggs you may choose to do this because supporting the vegetarian industry with your money is more important than not using a small amount of eggs plus the ceo of quorn came out recently saying the reason they still use eggs is because there is a lack of potato starch currently but wants to go full vegan for their products it depends on your reasons for thinking veganism is worthwhile i may have just waffled on here but maybe something is of value editwords
nottheonion,not_removed,you lost me here the people in the wbc the jerks who picket funerals know that gay relationships are wrong they know that the people having gay sex are not only damning themselves to hell for eternity they are causing all sorts of horrible worldwide devastation by incurring gods wrath because most people dont buy into their basic premise we dont see them and say well those tactics are a little aggressive but theyre coming at it from a place of love instead we say wow look at those assholes similarly vegetarians and vegans know that meat consumption is bad we know that it supports a horribly unethical factory farming system we know that people who eat meat are not only risking their own health they are contributing to environmental disasters aggressive tactics have the same result in both cases people ignore your argument and think youre an asshole unlike with the wbc who really are unreasonable and way off base there is a solid case to be made for reducing or eliminating meat and animal product consumption i actually did know a guy who would go around calling strangers bloodmouth to their faces i doubt he ever convinced anyone to cut back on meat but calm explanations of the health and environmental benefits have a real chance of getting the average omnivore to cut back on meat which is better than just pissing them off and not changing their diet
nottheonion,not_removed,likely more than you seeing as i work in the vegan food industry
nottheonion,not_removed,ive been on both the giving an receiving end of the whole having something i dont eat put into my food and then asked if i liked it i guess it really boils down to context and the relationship you have with those people neither giving or receiving was case of violating a religion or for a health reason
nottheonion,not_removed,how much fat is in your vegan diet that may have been the problem especially since some cheese is very low in lactose
nottheonion,not_removed,for me whether or not it would make you sick isnt the point its fucking disgusting i dont want to eat some dead animal well sure but a lot of people are skeeved out when the living ones wiggle the whole way down
nottheonion,not_removed,how hard is it in your country to get anything without meat we have salads soups and what not on our menus all around germany and were the country everybody sees as sausage fest
nottheonion,not_removed,indian thai and mediterranean food are my go to things to eat because rather than trying to substitute meat with soggy depressing tofu like what typically happens in the us they build meals around other foods which has allowed me to branch out and find some pretty cool shit to try that i would never have thought about tasting previously once i made the switch to vegetarianism i started caring about other ingredients a lot more as well now i look for those same curries or stews or anything else that you mentioned that taste so much deeper than just ordering another burger and fries kudos to you on picking up those dishes im a vegetarian server working at a fairly upscale barbecue restaurant and we picked up some vegetarian and vegan options as well to balance out the heaviness that comes with barbecue and theyve been very popular
nottheonion,not_removed,thats great
nottheonion,not_removed,except the context is sneaking vegetariansvegans meatanimal products where its clearly unacceptable so why are you bringing it up
nottheonion,not_removed,it all depends most salads here love to put chicken or fish on them some pub type places have a veggie burger or nachos i was at a fancier restaurant this weekend though with family and they had literally nothing on the menu for me they were wonderful about preparing something with the veggies they had on hand however
nottheonion,not_removed,are these the sausage fests i keep hearing about
nottheonion,not_removed,chefs can be surprisingly accommodating my immediate family all vegetarian once had to eat at a restaurant that had no vegetarian options on the menu—not even sides wed been dragged there by the extended family and going somewhere else wasnt really an option since it was a reunion sort of deal when we asked the waitress if there was anything vegetarian we could eat she went to ask the chefowner he came out personally to meet us asked us a couple of questions about what we liked and didnt like and then improvized a unique surprise vegetarian meal for each of us it was some of the best food ive ever had we were practically moaning after we ate he came out to speak with us and get feedback on his impromptu creations and he barely charged anything
